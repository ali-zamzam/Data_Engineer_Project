Great Company & Customer Service,Millenium has been extremely helpful from the very beginning of my experience. They send reminder emails & give step by step directions. The customer service representatives were also very friendly & informative.,5
Log-in Issues,"I called because I needed to figure out an issue with logging in. The man I spoke with was extremely helpful, and efficient. He was able to quickly send a new email, and problem was solved in under 5 minutes. It's always refreshing talking to someone who is a competent helper. Much appreciated.",5
The representative I spoke to was UTTERLY PERFECT! He deserves so much praise and a raise!,"The representative I spoke to was beyond helpful. Above and beyond kind, this is my first time with a 401k and he was truly so information and so kind. I hope his boss gives him this praise because he really made my day and helped me endlessly",5
"Helpful Customer Service, Slow Processing Time","Customer service has been very informative and helpful. Old company I worked for transfered my account into Millennium Trust after a few years of not working there. The one downside I experienced is the lengthy processing time of withdrawing your funds, wasn't expecting to have a 10+ day delay so I could move my funds to my portfolio. Other than that the short experience with them was good.",4
All my questions were answered,"My experience was a satisfying one. All my questions were answered, and the representative was helpful getting me information I requested. Thanks!",5
It  took numerous attempts to connect…,It  took numerous attempts to connect with a live agent and not a chat bot.  I was interested in knowing how long a distribution takes.  A suggestion for the future would be to add a time frame to any  correspondence.  Why does it take 15 business days to push buttons for an ACH transaction is a question that i have.,3
Amazing!!,"The agent, Donna, that assisted me was very helpful, polite and professional. I left that employer 20 years ago and wasn’t aware I even had this IRA. I had my distribution within 5 days of application.  Well done Millennium Trust!",5
Lisa was wonderful,"Lisa was wonderful.  She didn't just give directions, she went through the process step by step until completion.  She should be commended for her knowledge and patience.",5

Luis at the help center was FANTASTIC,"Luis at the help center was FANTASTIC.  He listened to my issue, explained how to solve the problem, and took the steps to do so, all while I was on the line.  And it only took a few minutes.",5
I am a new customer in past couple of…,I am a new customer in past couple of weeks.   I set-up and account on-line.   A couple of days later I had change phone number and tried to get back into the account.   I was not able to get back into account because MT wanted to send text to my old phone number.   I called and MT said they would will change it.   I took four days and and four calls and each time they said they need to put work order to take care of it.  All people were nice but didn't solve problem.Not a good start for MT.   Hope it gets better,3

Friendly quick easy resolution,Im getting my funds transferred to my bank account and I got help from the customer service representative.,5
Excellent service and information…,"We transferred an IRA from Millennium to another provider. The experience was complicated and non-intuitive, and took 3 weeks from the date that the other provider submitted the transfer paperwork directly to Millennium. The other provider does not charge any of the fees that Millennium charges, including annual account maintenance (even if funds remain uninvested in a money market acct) and transfer related fees. The website was not very intuitive, especially when the transfer already occurred, there was no notification about this of any kind, online or via email (we had to call to confirm transfer status). The website kept looping to same page with no explanation why account access was not possible. The tier 1 customer support via phone was repeatedly rude. She did not allow asking clarifying questions, and instead transferred us with no explanation, putting on a 10 minute hold. Tier 2 customer support was a different story, knowledgeable and courteous. Terrible training and low standards for Tier 1 are a show stopper. Unfortunately, as a result of these experiences, Millennium falls far short of competition and I will never again use or recommend them. Much room for improvement.",5
The rep was very helpful.,I love the direct deposit option as many companies make it difficult to distribute from accounts. Definitely want to use this company in the future. Plus customer service representative was extremely helpful.,5

My 401 k and found it at your company,"Easy to use system. I didn't even know that an account had been transferred, but they tracked me down and made sure I had the information that I needed to take care of everything. I appreciate that!",5
Good job,Lady that spoke with me was very rude. She said she couldn’t hear me so I looked at my phone to make sure I wasn’t on speaker an when I put the phone back to my ear an said I don’t know why she said well you must of done something cause I can hear you fine now with an attitude. I literally pulled the phone away from my head an looked at my phone an put the phone back to my head. I don’t appreciate the attitude an being called a lier.,5

Super quick and easy,"Very easy, informative.",5
Were very useful once I called in.,"I was stuck with them when my account was transferred without my knowledge from TIAA. Millenium had no record of me for weeks, even though the money was transferred electronically. Finally, after about 3 weeks and many pointless phone calls, they informed me that they found the transfer, but were missing some information, so were waiting on TIAA to get that to them. Finally, after a month, I was able to open an account. Had to pay a $35 fee for starters, which sucked. Then trades cost $8/each. I haven't paid for a stock trade in years! So that sucks. First stock purchase went through, but got an error message on second one. Something like ""could not execute trade. Ambiguous something..."" So I tried to trade again. Same error. I tried a third time, and only then, after more poking around, did I realize that hey... the trades had gone through. Dang. So multiple of the same trade at $8/pop. Ridiculous. Oh well, I figured I'd eat it. Next disappointment came the following day, when I tried to set up dividend reinvestment. Couldn't find any way to do that on the website. So I called in, and after some checking with others, the agent informed me that they don't do dividend reinvestment for stocks or ETF's, just for mutual funds. What garbage! So I'd need to manually come in every month and make a purchase (with a big trading fee!). Forget that. I decided to switch this Roth IRA over to Fidelity, which doesn't have crazy excess fees, doesn't lose my money for a month, actually does dividend reinvestment (DRIP) easily right on their webpage, etc, etc, etc. A far superior company. Every other brokerage I've used (TIAA, Transunion, Sofi, Etrade, etc, ) are all VASTLY better than Millenium Trust in every way I can imagine. I'll be happy when my Roth is out of Millennium's control, and I can stop the bleeding. Goodbye and good riddance!!!",5
My review,It was a pleasure,4
Customer Service,Stephanie was incredibly helpful in guiding me through the self-directed IRA account opening process and the process to deposit a rollover check into that account as well as move a Millennium-custodied rollover IRA into the newly created self-directed IRA account.

Very helpful!,good job thank you,5
Thanks so much,Lack of hands on help. My old employer I haven't work for in a year and a half out of nowhere sends more money after I already had closed the account and instead of it goin to my bank account I have to do all these extra steps and get charged all the fees once again for a low amount the old employer sent.,5

I was informed that I had to do everything online that she couldn’t even assist with a withdrawal.  Now I am dealing with a continuous circle.  The online verification process says my email is verified but when I try to login it keeps taking me back saying I need to enter the verification number.  Not an enjoyable experience.  This started 10/7 then I worked on it again 10/10.  I was also informed I could login on my phone but it states in the email that a laptop or desktop is preferable.

Excellent customer service,I have used Millennium Trust as custodian for my self-directed IRAs (Traditional and Roth) for the last 7 years.

It was nice and simple and easy,Not helpful. Wasted my time. Told me what I provided was all wrong etc. Called back and spoke to a manager and found out what I needed to. This girl needs more training.,5
Great,"By local standards it wasn't a lot of money, a retirement fund from the YMCA, part time work in childcare. Also i am appallingly inept w/tech. A super nice helpful guy in Las Vegas Andre helped me initiate back in Sept. There was a brief delay over one omission. Then i was very dismayed when it seemed your company blocked my number.

Trusted,"The people and the service were great. They went out of their way to take care of me and I appreciate it. The problem is that overall my experience is quite negative because .. FEES! so many and so much. I never wanted this account to begin with and it's stupid to try and do business with this company long term. So many better options out there. They get two stars overall since they did have great service. But I'd prefer to never hear from them again.Update: They called me back because I gave them 2 stars and waived about half of what they had charged me in fees. I probably still wouldn't do business with them, but they did really help their credibility with me.",5
Dedicated and caring,"While it took a bit of time initially and it was a bit difficult to provide the required information, when I went back to the website after a vacation, you had apparently received all that you needed, and I was able to request the 401(k) account be closed and the funds sent to me.

trsnsamerica…,Great no issues,5
Fast service and accurate,"When I was fortunate enough to have the time to break through the labyrinth of automated messages and speak to an actual person, this actual person was quite helpful.As an aside, I note that MTC is still stating ""we are receiving a higher than normal call volume, so you may experience a longer than usual wait"".I experienced this message for nearly a year. At what point does ""higher than normal"" and ""longer than usual"" become ""normal"" and ""usual""?The solution? Hire more people, and/or pay the ones that you hire more money so that they stay. The automated stuff doesn't cut if 98% of the time.The generic, cut and paste response you provided doesn't instill much confidence. If you want to ""make sure we’re providing the best experience possible and the resources you need"", the solution is easy (please see above).",5

I was work hard helping  people,"Spent over and hour just trying to see what my balance was. Created new account online, and at the very last step, site wouldn’t send verification codes to my phone. (Worked fine throughout signup process)They arrived 20 minutes later. The ‘digital assistant’ was utterly useless and wasted a lot more time. On the plus side I was finally able to reach a human being who tried (unsuccessfully) to help me. Process shouldn’t have had to take me more than an hour. Hoping future dealings will be better than my introduction.",4
Really good experience,Good explanation of withdrawn process,5
Love it great place to invest in,Not showing or telling myself when the funds are available,5
Rollover,"I spent an hour on the phone, winding through the interminable maze of things necessary to get my rollover funds dispersed to my financial advisor, specifically making sure they issued the check correctly. Of course that did not happen. Now I'm trying to fix it, and they are apparently unable to do what we need. And they keep pointing out what I supposedly did not do correctly, despite the fact that it was their representative on the phone working with us to issue the check. Frustrated does not begin to cover it. I will probably take the tax hit and deposit the check rather than continue to work with these useless people.",5

Not very helpful was told to do…,I’ve had more pleasant experiences at the DMV than I’ve had here. I’ve been trying to remove my money from their fee happy hands for over 5 years. They take every possible step to ensure that they can continue to drain fees from my account. I swear this is the only reason they’re still in business. I would rather have a root canal on a roller coaster than ever deal with this company again. I’m also pretty sure they’ll find a way to charge me a fee for writing this review. Also notice they don’t respond to negative reviews. They only respond to positive ones. That should tell you everything you need to know about a company right there.,3

I was send a document asking me to sign…,"My employer selected Millennium Trust to handle connecting me with the IRA they had established on my behalf. After I left my job, I wanted to roll over this balance to a ROTH IRA with Fidelity. Millennium Trust made the process exceptionally challenging to complete what I wanted to do. It took me at least 10-15 hours to talk to people on the phone, send emails, generate letters, find printers, and mail things. Somehow Millenium Trust requires wet signatures in our modern society. I started with the automated letter generator from Fidelity because it contained all the details Millenium Requested for doing a rollover. When I submitted the form as the systems specified, I was told I had made mistakes and that they could not complete my request. I then called Fidelity, and they helped me generate a different letter, and the agent confirmed that they deal with rolling over accounts with Millennium all the time - thus they were sure this would be an easy process. After mailing them this letter from Fidelity, they once again told me I had made a mistake and were unable to complete my request. Finally, I called Millenium, and the rude agent scoffed at my issue and directed me to another way to close the account. Ultimately, there is not enough guidance for transitioning accounts, and what should have taken an hour or two was drawn out over an entire month. Very disappointed.",3

IRA Distribution,"Millennium Trust's customer service for individual account holders sucks. It does everything in its power to put a customer through automated chatbots, which can be decent guides for people who don't actually educate themselves with what the website has to offer, but is a black hole for when you need the answer to a question that the website does not clarify. Their ""live contact"" link goes to what appears to be a chat window, with ""live chat"" in big letters, and ""waiting for agent"" at the top. Truth is, agent will never come. But they never tell you that. They're trying to lead you through a tree of questions, where all it does is give you links to other parts of their website. And it actually has nothing to do with the availability of an agent during business hours. This is the experience 24/7.At some point, the chatbot will eventually tell you that if you need more help, to contact support. Isn't that *exactly* what this Support Link/Live Chat is supposed to be? (and this Contact page to get support is itself conveniently buried under ""Profile"", otherwise you won't find it anywhere else). And when they tell you to contact support, they don't even specify how. It takes another path through Q&A to get to the point where they give you a number to call (these places usually do a great job of hiding any contact phone number).  When you call the number, of course it tries to keep you away from a real person for as long as possible, but if you call during (east coast) business hours, eventually you'll  get a real person.I eventually was able to talk to a real person, but it took me from a Friday to Monday morning to realize what was going on and how things worked. The interaction with the agent itself was fine and this is not a commentary on the experience with the agent.I understand that Millennium Trust is probably built to serve large institutions more than retail account holders, but still, that bulls*** ""live chat"" and ""waiting for agent"" is exceptionally and purposely deceptive.",5

For all of the negative reviews, I hope this one is helpful in turning that around. In making my request, I left out no steps and made sure the information was correct. It paid off!",5

"I want to thank you,my truck broke down",I struggled for months to get my identity authenticated. It is very hard to get ahold of anyone and reaching anyone online is a joke. I spoke to 3 different people and they all told me completely different reasons as to why my identity was not authenticated yet.

Overall a great customer service…,The representative I spoke with was not helpful at all I would ask her a question and she would answer it with a question then finally she told me what I asked but she was very rude,5
The call rep that helped me so polite…,"Horrible, horrible, horrible. Had my funds sent here by a previous employer and it has been MONTHS and I'm still unable to get my money away from them and onto my current employer's plan. Online ""customer service"" will send you in circles, insisting you didn't submit forms you absolutely did. Template answers only, no real humans to be found. They very transparently work to prevent you being able to get your money away from them (and will steal your money the second they have it in ""fees"" to open the account you never asked for, and fees to close it if/when you ever manage to get your money back). How this place hasn't been shut down as the scam it is is beyond me.",5
Distribution amount…,The Representative was so stuck on “protocol“ that I couldn’t even ask a generic question about whether we could use our form or they had a specific form. He said he had to talk to the owner of the account just to tell me whether they have their own forms ridiculous protocol,5
They was very polite and kind to me and…,"Closed the account over a week ago, and still have not received the funds.  Understand this takes time, but no communication and no action.",5
My response was responded to…,"I had the most awesome representative on the line to help me get through this procedure of obtaining information of getting an account started, and what my options were with the money I had in there. After I have talked with her, I felt relieved from a long-time stress, and she was able to help me with my husband also since he had brain surgery. She is definitely a great access to your staff.",5
The representative took the time to…,"Attempted to close account through distribution, website was frustrating as I couldn't continue my request with the tracking number it gave. After re-requesting I had to prove my bank account was mine by supplying a voided check.  So I reached into my check book and....oh wait it's 2022 nobody has a checkbook.  I got what I now know is called a starter check from my bank, it was not accepted as my name was written not printed. However I was not notified that my starter check was not sufficient after 5 days, I called the help line and was told it wasn't sufficient proof. The gentleman said a direct deposit form would work just fine. Would've been nice for the website to mention ANY OF THIS. So here I am, one week into the process, no confirmation email or anything and I have to wait potentially 10 business days to receive my distribution. Thanks millenium trust for making me jump through frustrating hoops with little to no info as to where we are in the process just to get, MY MONEY. Never again.",5
Review of registration validation,"Very helpful, fast easy process, no problems at all",4
The website was great,"I was told that my request for distribution was all set to go by one agent and then received an email stating that I needed to give them a call and another agent, who was not very friendly, told me that I needed to submit more info.

The process in cashing out my 401 k was…,"Requested disbursement of my account on 09/05/22, submitted documentation at that time to deposit it our joint checking account.  I called and spoke with Michelle in Pittsburgh on 9/13 to check the status of the disbursement and she said everything looked good and the funds should be in my account on 9/19/22.  I received an email on 9/15 saying there was an issue.  On 9/16/22, I went into the portal and uploaded a copy of the check again.  I then called to follow up and spoke with Jackie in Chicago who advised my name has to be on the check.  My name is on the account, however, we use checks minimally and have never ordered new checks with my name on the account.  The address is on the check and I offered to send a copy of the bank statement with my name on the account which is listed on the check.  They advised I would have to contact the bank, have them submit a one page document on letterhead with account number, routing number, and my name as being on the account.  My major issue is that now the process starts all over again and I have to wait 10 more business days for the funds to be processed.  If I would have known this when I spoke with Melissa, I could have addressed the issue then.  No matter what I do, the process starts all over again today and it will take 2 MORE weeks (10 business days) before the funds are processed.  I don't understand why the process has to start all over again.",5

Knowledgeable and helpful,"While the employees I spoke with are very pleasant, overall, there is a lack of fundamental communication with their clients, and very generalized information on email confirmations, with little to no details on the next steps after you’ve submitted a withdrawal request. Compared to other Trust companies I’ve worked with, this is by far the longest it has taken to have a disbursement distributed to my account - currently going on 10+ business days now. Again, the people were nice, but I will use a different Trust company in the future with more efficient logistics and personalized communication.",5

I found that MT does not offer a return on investment worthy of my trust, my profit was eaten up by the fees.  I also found that communicating with MT was very difficult and wrenching my accumulated savings from them to put into my regular IRA was a two year ordeal.

I was an emotional wreck and she had a keen sensitivity to my situation and literally praised me for taking control, told me she would walk me through everything so that I could be verified and able to remain in control. She was so professional and sharp and when I shared that my plan was to transfer my money to a new brokerage, when asked she gently answered all my questions about the competitiveness of Millennium Trust Company. She didn’t hard sell me, she just shared the great things of the company and I am strongly now considering staying with a company that would hire such wonderfully caring people that have strong human character and integrity. Amber literally changed the trajectory of my day which was going not well with her tender and fully invested cheerfully positive disposition.

The service was fast and painless,"Honestly I can’t speak much about the company since I have never dealt with them before. However I did have a question about an online form and had to call in to talk to an agent. I know I asked a few dumb questions but I would like to think they were very normal especially for someone who’s never heard of or had an IRA account. The representative, Peggy, was very short and rude with me. At one point the phone cut out and I couldn’t hear her so I politely asked if she could hear me and got no response. After about 30 seconds to a minute I finally heard her voice say “hello?” and I asked if she could hear me she said yes. I apologized and let her know the phone cut out and let her know the last thing I heard. She sighed heavily on the phone and said “you really didn’t hear anything I said?” as if you imply that I did that on purpose and my call was an inconvenience to her. I understand calls dropping is annoying but none the less it’s not like it was intentional and it’s not like I had an attitude with her. So I’m not quite sure what her exact issue was but what I can say is she was the face of the company for my call and I can only assume that her behavior is accepted by the company and it’s management and that alone let’s me know I’ll never do business again with this company. All I wanted to know was the difference between withdrawal and distribution just to make sure I was filling out the right form online. Glad I finally got the question answered even if there was unnecessary attitude.",5
Withdrawal,"My 401k was switched to this company. They charge a ridiculous amount of fees, $25 here $50 a year, $10 here for paper….such a sham….avoid if possible",5

I find Trustpilot is really useful,"My previous employer transferred my 401K to this company. I wanted to consolidate my 401K accounts by moving my money from this account to my new 401K fund. Their process is so cumbersome and they are not willing to assist you at all. I submitted what I thought was sufficient documentation from the new 401K fund(Fidelity) following the paperwork requirements by mtrust. All I got was - this is not enough, here review our list of 30+ bullet points. Which is what I followed initially. I emailed them back asking for clarification as to which bullet points did I miss or if they can tell me what else I need to submit. I got a very vague, lazy email saying ""call this number"" clearly trying to push the responsibility to somebody else who answers the phone calls. I pulled my money and closed my account. I would rather pay the penalty then dealing with lazy people who just want to get their pay check and do nothing in the meantime to assist the customers.",5

I told her that the Spanish line took a long time and if we could speak Spanish, she answered I can't speak Spanish to you, because you chose the English option, when she said she does speak Spanish, this had never happened to me… this is very unprofessional, rude to the point of arguing with me, and have to raise my voice and hang up at her .",5

5 stair everything went wonderful staff…,"I my ex company didn't want to deal with managing their pensions any more I guess. So they transferred it to Millenium Trust into an IRA.  My IRA is less than $4K. It was set up with the following fees:1. $30/year for ""management"" (they literally do nothing, no investment strategy, nothing.  Just sits in an account earning 25 cents / month).2. They also charged me $10 just to send the notification in the mail to me that they now had my IRA funds.  And this $10 is also a yearly fee (for each annual report)By the time I was able to intervene, They had removed $70 from my IRA. And my ""managed"" retirement savings had earned $3.3. Oh, and as a final parting display of Wall Street greed, they will take another $25 from my savings as a ""Closing Account Fee"" when I roll it into my Roth, which is managed by an honest company with NO yearly fees. Thanks for robbing a poor working stiff's miniscule retirement savings.  Enjoy your ill-gotten gains.  We are sharpening the guillotine for all of you Wall Street leeches.  The pitch-forks are coming.UPDATE: To their credit, Millenium Trust called me after this review and restored the $70 in maintenance fees they had so far taken out.  I'm still going to transfer my money out though, and will still pay the $25 fee to close the account.  But I appreciate this gesture from them.",5

Great customer service,"I had a tough investment question for your team. Knowing that the initial agent would not be able to answer my question, she appropriately passed my call along to another department. After being quickly transferred through 3 different agents, I reached someone who understood what I was asking, and he addressed the questions I had without hesitation to the best of his ability. Some people may have been frustrated with the transfers to other departments, I was happy that the Millenium agents were not just “trying” to answer my inquiry. I left the conversation with some confidence in Millenium Trust and will continue to utilize their service. Thank you.",5
I was able to accomplish my objective…,"One of my retirement accounts was rolled over to Millennium Trust by mistake.  I filled out forms with my brokerage agency to request that the account be returned to my broker.  They sent all the documentation to Millennium Trust at the beginning of August, along with a follow-up letter in mid-August.  As of the end of August, Millennium Trust has no record of receiving the paperwork, and nothing has happened.  They clearly have serious problems with the handling of documents received by paper mail.  And . . . Even since that time, more documents have been mailed to the *correct* address, a fax has been sent to the correct number (I saw the confirmation), and Millennium Trust still has no record of anything.  I called customer support, but all they tell me is that they haven't received anything.  This whole thing sounds really suspicious to me.",5

Easy to use service,All due respect I'm not pleased at all! I worked hard for what little money my past employer rolled over which was $908.50... Well since then I am so it has depreciated and I got hit with a lot of things and almost 7 months ago I requested from my bank which is synthetic credit Union for my money to be rolled over well on your end I guess you didn't get it and it was sent by my banker she is a manager who does her job efficiently so I don't know why anyone from mutual trust did not receive my transferred paperwork by the bank a financial institution. And it's taking me through a whole bunch of loops just to transfer my money so for that I'm really not liking this organization so hopefully I can get this issue resolved really soon I had to log on into the system and become a member and that was something I did not want to do I simply wanted my funds rolled over and transferred into my personal bank account which would make an IRA that I was trying to set up and that I will do very soon of course meanwhile by waiting on this process my money is dumbing down in your system and that's something I'm just not agreeing with!,5
6 stars out 5,"I had a 401k switch to Millenium Trust with no notification. I had to hunt down the account holder and was given the wrong info twice. I found the money and registered as a client. The website didnt work to upload photos to verify identity. Had to email them, then it took two more weeks to hear from them that i had access to my account. I made numerous calls to try to navigate the website. Everyone i spoke with had to solve a different problem. They told me it was fixed, but got off the phone and an email said it would be three more business days to get into my account. Very frustrating!",5

I spent several hours at my bank trying to get all sorts of letters to help you send my funds. As of today I still haven’t received my money.

Customer service,"When I began this process I thought I would be leaving a 1 star negative review due to my first impressions of your business.  However, due wholly to Marlene I have adjusted that to 4 stars.  She is the only reason I have gained any confidence back that the company may have a customers best interest at heart.To explain, my funds were rolled over to MTC by a former employer.  I contacted the company to have my funds distributed back to me as I have been battling cancer, multiple surgeries & procedures & everything that comes with it.  My first contact was met with what I felt was unprofessional & rude behavior by your customer service agent as I was trying to explain my situation (I was asked why I ""didnt look at my mail since December"" etc insinuating fault on my end) & felt it was met with impatience, talking over me & general condescending attitudes.  After I asked to speak with a manager I was connected with Marlene.  At every step she was professional, she kept her word as to what to expect & when. I felt the way you SHOULD feel when entrusting your funds & future in someone elses hands.  I WISH she had been my first contact as then I could've in good conscience given a 5 star review.  As a professional myself who has worked in customer service at all levels I understand that sometimes our front line/first contact customer service personnel fails to push forward the spirit or values the company holds as standard.  You never know what a customer is going through or often times why someone needs a dispersement but everyone should be treated respectfully.  Marlene is an asset to your company & someone who you should be proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with...Please make sure that she is recognized for her vital role in being the reason my mind was completely adjusted regarding MTC by her compassion & prompt execution of my dispersement.",5

I called customer service & the automated system try’s to keep you from speaking to an agent saying that they have high call volume. As I kept asking for an agent then Im told my hold time is less than 2minutes (high call volume). Once the agent answered his demeanor was that he was being bothered to the point you could hear sighs. The most he could tell me was there is a delay, we could mail you a check which would take longer through the mail. I only had little interaction with this company but the little I had was not good & it’s not a company I would want to do business with in the future.",5

I am so happy and relieved. Thank you Ward and Millennium Trust.Sincerely, Aggie Williamson",3
Very clear,"Everything had been good. Great Customer Service. Website is good overall some self service areas could be made simpler with clearer understanding of what MT is requesting from the user. The problem came when I submitted a DocuSign document that the Customer Service Rep so graciously took the time on Aug 17, 2022 to walk me through to completion was found nowhere in the system although I had the completed signed copy right in front of me. I was shocked as there is a time restraint on my end, so to think that it was being processed only to find out that not only is it not being process but that it was nowhere to be found was a little breathtaking. I ended up having to forward the completed dated and time stamped form to Distribution which means that the process started 4 to 5 days after the original date of submission",5

Excellent Customer Service,I started this account when I was 19 because I didn’t understand how money works at the time. I put away $1000 into my millennium trust account and after 10 years of never touching that money I came back to check my account again and I lost half my money so this company is entire freaking waste of time when it comes to making or saving money I promise. They charge fees every month for “service fees” but truly they don’t do anything for your account besides steal your money,4

Sudhir review,"Decent wait time to speak with an agent, who was friendly enough.  New account, rolled over from old employer.  No correspondence from old investment group, old employer or Millennium came as a surprise.  New user account not the easiest to set up.  Also have to wait 3 days for account to activate before seeing my funds. Hopefully it becomes easier to track.",5

Finally I called customer service representative who was difficult to reach. The second or third time that I was able to reach a customer service representative the person just told me the extent of the account. I was not able to login on the website to see for myself. I am still waiting for the money to arrive to the place where I asked the money to be sent. I am still waiting for the money to arrive,4

She was great and patient,Excellent prompt service. Glad I stumbled across them.,5
Very helpful,"Absolutely frustrated and upset over being unable to get a copy of the last statement.  I'm old (81) and terrible with a computer.  I tried - was on line about 40 minutes, and unable to do it because I'm an idiot with tech stuff.  So, I phoned.  Gave the lady all the information she asked for - last 4 digits, full name, address, date of birth, which company did the 401K originate from, etc. and she still wouldn't let me have the statement. Now have to wait for her to send me a verification form to complete and mail back to her.  When that's received, they'll send the last statement to me.  How long will all that take?  About 10 days?It is shocking that you cannot cater better to old people.  This is a very small 40lK - just about $3,000, and nobody is interested in helping me.  Shame on you.",5

They charged me the $100 which is my future year’s fee for handling, and $100 for closing my account since my disbursement was $2700 the balance of my 401k before taxes. They justified by saying I was late paying. So they took me coming and going. I have now paid a fee for next year AND I’ve paid for closing the account. I tried explaining too that I had sent a check to them and Hard Assets each at the same time. Hard Aseets received theirs fine but Millenium never cashed theirs. I asked Celina, my contact for this transaction, twice, for reconsideration of taking all of these fees, but she never responded. I think what they did is horrible. That’s why I give them a one.",5
Great and easy online experience,"Millennium Trust received a transfer of pension-related funds belonging to me about which they did not notify me over the past 10 years plus. The institution that provided the pension did not contact me either to indicate that they money would be transferred to Millennium Trust. Millennium Trust has been charging me a maintenance fee since receipt of my money. Upon learning about these funds, I contacted them ten days ago to initiate the process for transferring the money into a 401K. They instructed me to complete a form and wait for a follow up email from them to continue and conclude the transfer process. I have yet to receive anything from them (except for this comment request). Significantly, I also do not know whether or not they will refund the maintenance fees they extracted, because they did not bother to obtain an updated address for me. It seems that the process should not be so opaque and sloppy, and I am disappointed that with their fiduicary responsibility, they did not make any effort to contact me about my pension fund.",5

Everyone was very understanding,"My former employer's 401k went to these guys by surprise, which put this relationship off to a bad start.

Here we are on Wednesday 8/10/2022 and still no money.  I explained I dont request this unless itvis an emergency but no one and I mean no one cares.  They have no sense of urgency for anyone.  They are dealing with other peoples money and livelihood and whether or not they have power, water and food to eat and they dont care.

She stayed on the call with me while i completed the forrm (even when i took some calls since it was in the middle of my work day). She told me to expect the money in 1-2 business days. The money was in my account in 2 hours. I was really in a financial bind and couldn't believe this came in at the perfect time. Thank you so much Juanita for your patience and words of encouragement. Deeply appreciated.,4

Great service,I had a low dollar amount invested for a short stint at an employer before I rolled over to my current employers’s plan. Granted it was invested for no more than 2 years but I never saw any gains and instead saw my balance decrease as a result of annual and administrative fees. I do appreciate them reaching out after my original review.,5

The Millennium representative was very…,"A balance from a previous employer’s 401k rolled over into a Millennium Trust IRA without my knowledge. No one can explain to me why the balance remained in the 401k in the first place (I rolled the account over 3 months after separating from my previous employer and 10 months before the current balance was transferred to MT). I filled out paperwork prepared by my bank to transfer from MT to my preferred IRA, but I’m receiving email messages that claim there’s not sufficient information to perform the rollover (including missing my signature—which I absolutely signed). MT’s web portals are buggy and poorly designed. Phone and chat “support” is really geared toward providing no support at all (or at least only functionality that is already available in other formats). When I was able to speak with an agent, they were helpful. However, the automated menu systems are obstructive, actively discouraging me from trying to talk with an agent. Basically, I’m giving MT $30 to complicate my life with adminstrata that should have been settled months ago.",5
She was kind and very patient with me.,Account transferred to MT and not easily transferred to other main account.  Excessive fees for maintenance?  Fees for printed statements.,5
Very good so far.,"Very professional, quick response.",4

After this horrible experience, and in a separate transaction on the same day, I received a message stating that requested information was not received, when in fact I submitted this information twice.

Great company,"Millennium Trust is like ""The Last Jedi"" of financial companies - somehow it has good ratings with the BBB and such, like ""The Last Jedi"" had good reviews from critics, but the customer/viewer experience seems to be waaayyyyyy different. This company has been slowly draining my account with fees for years, and makes it so hard to actually move MY OWN MONEY out of their stranglehold that I've started the process and given up several times (their intent, I'm sure, with the convoluted processes and iffy customer service).Do yourself a favor and if your company puts your retirement into their care, get out as quickly as you possibly can.",5

IRA Distribution,"Charges fees left and right. Charged a fee to send me a postcard telling me a had an account, charges $35 annually, charges for mailing paper, but never once sent a letter until last week.— later: After calling about this, they agree to “investigate” the issue and submit a request to return these fees after my info rolled over from a different trustee. I was told to wait a few days and saw nothing change in my account. Only after I left this review did I get a voicemail three days later from Pauline telling me they’re waiving my fees and pressuring me to write another review. I then get another call from another person pressuring me again, very vehemently, to write a new review before they actually did what they said they would do. If you have an account that rolled over, I would remove my funds immediately. They skirt the lines of ethics and rely on shady, near duplicitous tactics to maintain any sense of a reputation.",5

I received money from my account,"I have been trying to 'work' with Millenium Trust for two months now, to simply transfer cash from two custodial accounts over to an equivalent account on their platform. I've worked with a couple other custodians and this is typically filling out the appropriate forms and then waiting for the transfer to happen - that's not the case with Millenium Trust. I have many HOURS invested in filling out forms on their web site and then following-up to make sure they act on them, only to be sent the same forms via hardcopy (sometime 2 or three times) as if I hadn't filled them out already. Then, following-up on the new forms because no action takes place from there....and wait, and wait and then follow-up again. Trying to get a human on the phone there is a chore because they have automated menus that try to deter human contact - be it phone or chat. Trying to get simple beneficiary information entered properly was another matter - again, fill out their only form and then they complain that I need to fill out this 'other' form because I had submitted a trust, which I had not and I made that clear to them three times. Add to the tab three or four follow-ups to get them to fix both my beneficiary accounts because they either didn't act on my wishes or didn't act as indicated on the form. I  think Millenium Trust probably have good people working there, but their processes demonstrate a culture of ineptitude and I'm perplexed why Fundrise is requiring I work with them for custodial services because I'm not going to move any more of my retirement funds into Millenium Trust - life is too short to have to micro-manage my account custodian and since they are responsible for my retirement funds, that is of grave concern to me.",5
fast and amazing great service a,Needed assistance logging in. Agent helped me quickly and efficiently.,5
Very secured business,My previous company rolled over my401k to this company. Feels pretty predatory that I had to open an account and pay an account closure fee to transfer my IRA to my custodian of choice instead of them just releasing my 401k. The staff was helpful but seemed over their job and lacked enthusiasm. The fees are high and can’t wait to get my funds out of their possession.,5
very helpful and patient team,My former employer quickly rolled over my 401k to Millennium Trust. Millennium Trust had my money for less than a month and charged me $50 in fees. I had to wait for my new plan to get setup and to accept rollovers. UPDATE: Millennium Trust issued me a rollover check for $50 to cover the fees. Adding one extra star.,5

Hi i thought your website was fairly…,"My experience with Millennium Trust has been pretty good thus far. Taking into consideration that my funds have only been entrusted to Millennium Trust (MT) for about a week thus far, but from the looks of things, security is of the utmost importance which is a refreshing comfort. On the other hand, the availability, or should I say, the liquidity of  funds seem to suffer as I noticed a few unnecessary steps in what I would consider simple, or mundane procedures. Procedures simple in terms of MT's attempt to obtain my hand written signature which, from my estimation shouldn't require a series of up to 4 different emails, between 3 parties to include at least 1, possibly 2 phone calls. Only time will tell, but I can say 1 of the 2 customer service agents I've spoken to (Kate. D) has been extremely helpful & pleasant, as she was very knowledgeable, & her attention to detail was unusually high and in sync with her professional, yet courteous demeanor. With that said, the 2nd representative,being the bearer of said unnecessary steps, and being knowledgeable of his tasks' needlessness, soldiered down the same path as his predecessor, in skill as well as in effort.",3

Very knowledgeable on the questions…,"Using MTC for an IRA investment in an alternative investment. This company's service is horrendous, truly the worst financial services company I have ever dealt with in 35 years of investing. I see that it is private; I assure you the owners aren't investing in the service side. Talking to a human is a phone tree ordeal, then you get people that literally don't know what they are doing. They can't transfer calls without dropping you, or you end up in another queue. The staff you do talk to seems new and unsure of what they are doing with paperwork. Want to escalate and talk to a manager - just forget about it, you won't live that long. Want a call back after leaving a message (*voice and email) - it hasn't happened after about 8 tries - not one return call or email. I have been trying to get a ""case"" worked for 4 business days. They have lost emails, asked repeatedly for the same things, and then made absolutely no progress. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY IF YOU CAN HELP IT.",5

I had just talked to ADP about an account I had there. Even through this confused information I was giving her, she was not flustered or upset with how long it was taking me to access my account. She walked with me from providing me the right website I should use to access my account, to updating my info, to password creation to my losing the information, to helping me get back to where I should be. She was EXCELLENT and deserves a pay increase. At least she should get a pay increase AND teach other customer representatives the correct way of handling a customer who needs to have her hand held to get through the system. I am 64 years old and have contacted hundreds of customer service representatives in my lifetime. She is one of best I have ever interacted with. Cudos to the person who hired her.

Not a complaint but the only way I…,I got ripped off with all the fees so I withdrew my money and then another fee to closeout the account. This is the first place Ive had charge a fee for closing out my account. It seems as if its some sort of scam to make you decide to stay but with all the fees your account will go down to nothing. Wouldn't recommend this company.,4
Your customer service rep Dierdra is a Rockstar!,"The representative was helpful and patient.  The company's account set-up is ABYSMAL.  Very few sign-up features actually work.  as you set up your account, the MFA steps for iphone users (I assume that these are many, by the way), suck.  I got duplicate verification codes, multiple times (and no - I didn't click the button more than once to generate a code).  I must admit that clicking the button twice to generate a code would have been an intuitive thing to do, as it took an UNREASONABLY LONG TIME for the code to be texted to the user (me).  Apparently, Millenium Trust is using an inferior, low-cost SMS provider with terrible latency.  So - fair warning:  if you have an iphone, and you seek to verify your identity using SMS, you will likely get TWO verification codes sent to you, one immediately after the other, but you will have to wait an inordinately long period of time to get these two codes.  The next, begged question is ""which code do I enter?"" Logic would suggest to enter the more recent code.  DON'T DO THIS - it will fail.  Enter the first code sent - this is the only way I was able to get it to work.  Do you see the picture here ?  UNACCEPTABLE - AMATEUR HOUR.  Don't do business with this company - there are many other, better options.  Overall - a very bad experience.",5

I called and spoke with an ""agent"" who was coughing loudly on the phone and didn't seem interested in helping much, she sounded very tired and bored. I let her know I was just checking, since, I had not heard anything. She told me it takes up to five business day to process, and that I just needed to wait. I informed her it had been past the process time by a few days and just wanted an update on the status. She seemed irritated and then placed me on hold for about ten minutes, only to get back on the phone and tell me they do not know the status of my withdraw or where it is during the process. She did inform me that her ""team leader"" sent an email out to the company to handle it immediately. Whether or not they actually sent any email, I don't know. I feel like they just wanted to get me off the phone. As of today, I'm still waiting on word of what's going on. I will more than likely pull my money out once I research a company I feel like might do better.",5

Very smooth experience working with…,"Not happy with this company, or at least their policies.  My accounts (Roth and traditional) were forced here by my old company, even though I asked for the funds to be sent directly to me.  I kept looking for the checks and finally called the prior custodian to inquire, only to find that the funds were sent here.  I called Millennium Trust to get the funds transferred back to me, and find out that it’s going to cost me $55 per account to move them, because their fee to close an account is $25 and their yearly maintenance fee is $30 and is charged immediately upon receipt of the funds.  I asked for a refund of the maintenance fee at least, because the funds had been there only about 20 days, and was cheerfully informed that they only refund that fee if the funds are there less than a week.  A week!!  It would take longer than that just to get them their required paperwork to transfer the funds.  Maybe that’s the intent of the policy, so they can collect frivolous charges for doing nothing.  So, I’m out $110 just for the privilege of having my funds at Millennium for less than a month!  Totally unsatisfactory and not customer oriented or customer friendly in any way.   So much for their statements about how their customers are so important to them. I certainly didn’t feel important or respected after this experience, and I certainly won’t be leaving my funds here or dealing with them again.**UPDATE**Terri reached out to me by phone and offered to refund some of the charges against my accounts.  Not all, but some at least, for which I was, and am, very grateful.  It was refreshing to experience customer service personnel who proved that they actually DO care about their customers.   I am raising my 1-star initial impression to 3 stars--average, because not all of the charges were refunded and I did have to complain first.  However, overall I am much more pleased with the end result--some refund is better than no refund, after all.  (I would have raised it to at least a 4-star had they refunded all charges since I never intended any of my funds to end up here.)Thank you, Terri, you're a rock star!!!",5

Excellent customer service,"The website was fast and easy to understand. Everything was fairly straight forward. Unfortunately, however, the phone number I was given to contact Millennium Trust had been disconnected which was very stressful considering that my former employer moved the account, not myself. It would have been great if there had been a recording when I called, giving your new phone number or simply referring callers to the website.I hadn’t heard of Millenium Trust prior to now, so your reputation was completely unknown to me. After filling out all the necessary information, there was a prompt stating that my identity needed to be confirmed and that it could take 2 - 3 businesses days. I received an email almost immediately, saying that my information was confirmed and I would be able to access my account. I began the process of moving  the balance to another financial institution. I received notice that it would take a few days to receive. The balance was in my other account by morning.Seriously, everything was great after the phone call. The site was well designed and easy to navigate. I absolutely would have rated 5 stars if not for the 15 or so minutes of not knowing where the heck my money was. For all I knew, you could have been a shell company that disappeared to a tropical island after taking a few million dollars of peoples retirement money 😂😂😂",5

Very fast at responding,I wanted to take a moment to let you know how much I appreciate the excellent customer service and assistance I received from Michelle Ott today. She was very patient and knowledgeable about the issue I was trying to resolve. I have been trying to roll over funds from an older IRA to my current 401K plan – and kept running into road blocks – some of them of my making. Michelle assisted in three separate ways to get my issue resolved: She walked me through logging in online – but it kept taking me to the wrong place.She sent me link and sat with me through entering the information and DocuSign – which initially did not work. She then sent me another link and we were successful in getting the IRA Rollover Request done.She also gave me the email address to send support documents to.I work in customer service all day. I know when someone is just “doing the job” and when someone really wants to help.  Michelle Ott really wants to help and showed not the littlest bit of impatience. She is a stellar example of being helpful and going the extra mile. She represents Millennium Trust Company well!,5
Exceptional service,"Called for help moving funds from them to my credit union. Called ask for real person and was put on WAIT!!  Opt for a call back,10-20 mins. After an hour stated over. Waited on the phone. While waiting I went to the website and tried to get in. All I got was a repeat of QUESTIONS asking to identify who I was. After one and a half hours I called again. This was a little more fruitful, I finally got a REAL Person. But he was not able to get me satisfied. I asked for a supervisor who finally showed me an end to my quest. I'm being sent my account numbers so I can transfer funds to my local account. If there was a lower rating I would give it.

Happy,"Millennium trust, parent company of Payflex. Payflex is the absolute worst most fradulent provider of FSA services in the US. Stay far away from Millennium trust. If they cannot even manage an FSA plan DO NOT TRUST THEM WITH YOUR IRA!!!!!! Payflex will deny all claims and refuse to pay YOUR money for YOUR healthcare. Payflex is horrible, look at their reviews, NOBODY is happy with their services and they are proudly owned by Millennium Trust, they need to be shut down!!!",5
Experience was great.,"July 27 update:  Yes, Terri called and she has been helpful. However, it has now been a month, you have all of the information you need to make the transfer. My advisor at Vanguard has been calling your team everyday and the response is “waiting for liquidation”. It’s a simple target retirement mutual fund. This doesn’t take that long. Until the transfer actually happens, I will continue to update this review. Jun 29: It has been a month and a half since I initiated a request to transfer my IRA to another account. After a lot of paperwork plus two follow-up calls, the money is still with them. I have no idea how to get my money out at this point because clearly even phone calls where they promised it will be taken care of had led to no action.",5

I didn't want to withdraw the money, but we had an unexpected death in my family, so I had to do it. A $25 service charge is another ""nickel and dime"" process for customers.",4

The associate on the phone explained that there was a missing letter t from my other financial institution and explained that they notified them but never received a response....  He also explained how to get the transfer re-submitted.  At the end of the call, I also requested a refund of annual account fees since the original request.  He was VERY KIND to waive those fees for me.  So helpful and courteous.  10/10! 5 Stars! give that man a raise!  Thank you so much!!!!",5

While I did have to wait a while to talk to a representative to make sure my transaction was finalized, she was very helpful and explained everything to my satisfaction.",5
Thank you for the assistance.,Well 1 my name is spelt wrong on the email for this review. 2 I started on my distribution early June I was on the phone with Kevin who told me everything was good and all I need to do was send a voided check. Then after the so-called 5 days to review I haven’t received anything so I was worried with having to send a voided check. So I called and I was told my distribution was started but not completed. So after waiting 5 days already now I would have to finish it and wait another 5-7 days for my distribution. Which I needed it days ago and if I didn’t call I would of knew known no one sent a email or called about it. Again just told me after I filled everything out to send a void check and that’s all I needed to do. But when I called back after not receiving anything in my account I talked to a lady who set on the phone with me made sure I got the email and walked me through everything. That’s why I gave a 2 star because that lady was VERY helpful but the experience and lack of communication and still to this day having to wait longer for my distribution is why I rated so low. So hopefully I get it soon.,4

Ive had to do about 4 applications and anytime I email the company i just receive  an automated answer back. Apart from that I've been trying to withdraw my funds now for a month. You also get bombarded by emails even if they don't apply to you. I have sent for my identity to be verified 4 times now, but i still get emails saying to send documents to verify my identity. The videos that the company refers you to, is outdated and doesn't look anything similar to what the website looks like now. At no point when i email the company  does it seem I'm receiving  actual  responses  from another human being.",5

They were quick and efficient.,Today I started the process of distributing and withdrawing funds from an old IRA from my first job in high school that I had previously had trouble accessing (different account management company).

When I finally got around to transferring it to the final institution that houses my current employer's retirement account, I was only given the option to have the check sent directly to me, even though it's being rolled over into another financial institution, so I'll need to then mail it to the new institution myself. As a final insult, I was charged a $25 fee for this process. Acknowledging that much of my irritation is with my old employer and the policies that regulate these sorts of transfers, Millennium's role in this process seems to have cost me money with no discernible benefit.",5

Thank You!,The overall experience was not pleasant. The process to initiate a direct rollover is tedious and instructions are ambiguous. A common vernacular is not established and terms like “rollover” and “transfer” are used interchangeably. The representative that I spoke with over the phone was knowledgeable and pleasant but I had to aggressively bypass the eternal automated prompt loop with spamming ‘0’. I am overall unsatisfied with the  process and will attempt to avoid in the future.,5

This is NOT appreciated by this longtime customer.  I wouldn't be calling for support if I wanted to speak with a robot.  Plus the process for opening a new Roth IRA is not intuitive and parts of the online application process are broken (requiring a call with a live person). Last, if I qualify for Premium Support (as I do), then please route my call accordingly.  The routing process is broken - as validated by speaking with your support team",5

Great Experience,"A former part time employer transferred a small sum of money that I was unaware of to Millennium Trust. I was contacted immediately by mail with a packet explaining who they were and how my money ended up in an account with them, the details of how those funds came into their possession and the options I now have. This was a small amount of money so I elected to close the account. I started that process myself online and within a few days the funds were deposited into one of my personal bank accounts. The whole process from receiving the letter to receiving the funds took about one week and I was able to easily navigate the website and upload documents to  I prove my identity so pretty much everything was done online easily by me.

Because we are both in our 60's we are accustomed to the frustrations due to our lack of knowledge in this age of advanced technology.  Alicia provided patient guidance that will be long remembered and appreciated by us.  5 stars simply aren't enough - Thank You So Much Alicia!!

Easy platform to use,The website is nothing but a hassle to get onto. I had to get help a couple of times just to get logged in then when I just wanted a partial withdrawal I couldn't even understand how to do it so I ended up taking all my money because I don't want this hassle just to get out my money when I do need it. I didn't even know my money was with you guys otherwise I probably would've switched it to my company that I'm with now so I'm very disappointed that I was never notified of any of this,5

Good and helpful,My 401 was moved to Millinium from TIAA through the Diocies of Orange it was moved over at $459.00. I was earning .36 cents on my account and charged $35.00 each year for processing. including other fees I withdrew the remainder of the funds out because my investment company was taking more than I was earning. I left with less than $375. if I would not have called to withdraw they would have taken it all.

IRA account transfers/rollovers typically are dispensed by the holding institution (here, Millennium Trust) to the receiving institution (insert your bank of choice). However Millennium Trust requires your personal bank to contact them in order to do this, and my bank has told me they are the only institution that does this and has a form specifically because of them. Charges money for transfer and closing out the account when I never consented to them being the account holder in the first place.",5

She was very helpful and said she would personally expedite the payout. She kindly explained what needed to be done. If you get Tim, from the Pittsburgh office in support, hang up and try again. He was rude, not helpful and hung up on me. I originally called into Millennium Trust Company on the 22nd of April to initiate a disbursement. I was told it would take between 10 and 15 days. I just called in on the 2nd of May to make sure everything was lining up for an on time payment and was told by Tim that although I submitted my printed deposit slip with the correct information it wasn't signed and so I need to send in a new one and start the wait time over which now is running at around 20 days to process.

Perhaps Millennium Trust should practice the same diligence prior to receiving FBO funds without obtaining release from the owner before opening accounts.

Honestly,"I had no control over my IRA being sent to Millennium so 2 days after it was transferred to them I chose to close my account. There was not only a $25 fee (for having my money for less than a week) but very few options on disbursement; a debit card or a bank transfer (and then only if the account is in your name, my account is in husbands name). So I had no choice but to take the debit card which can only be sent by US mail. I would NOT do business with them in the future.",4

Great job!,"My former employer transferred my 401k to you after I left that job. Instead of continuing to invest you sat on the money for a year. Then when I decided to pull the money your website was very difficult to use. Creating an account was not easy. The user account portal is nonexistent. There were no options for me to do anything. When I tried to roll my 401k from you into my personal bank investment account I got an email that you couldn't do that but I could move it into my checking. That option was never given up until that point. Why are my options not clearly stated upon me logging into your crappy webstie? Then, on top of it all, you're stealing $25 from me when you did absolutely nothing with my money in the first place to earn it. You are terrible and believe me I will tell everyone I know how awful and horrible my experience was with you.",5

Rock On Millennium Trust!!!,"Calling customer service is a joke. They tell you you must do everything online. It took over 2 hours to confirm my account.  It kept saying I wasn't an American citizen!  Finally, I got it straight only to find out I could not see my statement which was my reason for going online because customer service can't send it to you. They can only confirm the balance.Since my last review Millennium reached out to me and emailed me a copy of my statement.  I appreciate their concern with my frustration and putting things straight.",5

Amazing,"I found out today Millennial Trust has had my 401k for 6 years. I was never notified nor agreed to change 401k provider, nor agreed to their fees.

First, it took over 2 weeks from the time my account was migrated to the time I was finally able to access my account, including 5 separate calls to Millennium.  Next, their login in process to setup your new account requries 7 different click throughs to acknowlege items on their website. What shoud be a 1 minute process takes over 5 because of all of the ""Accepting of Terms"" required to setup your account.Then their list of fees they charge is absurd.  $10 for a paper statement, annual holding fees, transaction fees, processing fees.  It is absolutely ridiculous.The first chance I get, I will be moving my funds from them and not do business with them.",5

I had a few questions and was very pleased with  help from Alicia (sp?) to clarify a few things.  Very pleasant to work with - and got everything I needed.   Thank You!,5
Everything went smooth,Why does it take 20 business days to look at a account? I put into my 402 every 2 weeks and you very happy tool my money. When I want to cash it out oh no 20 business days which equal to a month. Why is what I want to know. I believe your like the dann government you take my money but when I want it back you are so damn greedy you don't want to let go of said money. This is why I don't put my money in one.

My rep did a great job handholding me…,Agent was great but the process to recover funds is terrible. Not many places have checks and you have more than enough information to process a distribution over the phone like fidelity and other banks. I will never leave my money with your financial institution in the future. I’m trying to secure funds quickly for a house and you have delayed my process. Very very dissatisfied.Not sure if right hand talks to the left. I received a call saying I needed to submit an additional signature page and was sent 2 emails. I called back and they confirmed I needed to resubmit the same documents since they don't take electronic signatures like docusign(another failing) and a signature page. I submitted the documents immediately yet they called back 2 hours later saying they read my review and asking if I resubmitted my documents. I guess they didn't check before calling. I wish I could give a zero for this process. Looking forward to staying only with Fidelity in the future.,5

Alicia From Pittsburgh - The BEST!!,my money transferred to you by employer ..lots of high cost fees. finally got my money out of your greedy hands....lol.. never again.really hard to get access to my account to transfer my money away from your company.,5
Awesome experience so far,So far one of the worst companies I have ever dealt with. My account was rolled over to them two weeks ago. I did not receive notification. I have not received an account number. The process to roll it back to Fidelity is cumbersome and time consuming. Very stressful experience.,5
The header box was distorted (on my…,I have been on hold for over an hour!  I want to transfer my IRA account because Millennium Trust charges $35 per year to manage my IRA and a $25 penalty if I wish to transfer to a different management company. AWFUL!,4

Wonderful customer service!,"I spend 30 minutes in line waiting to talk to a customer service rep just to find out that I am still missing some paperwork, no one told me about and never received communication that it was needed.

It was nice working with your agent…,"Millennium Trust is a good and trustworthy company. I believe it is going through growth pain as its business is rapidly expanding, and as such logistics can naturally be improved. This is not unique to MT, and let us remember that these are special times for everyone. As a new customer  in January 2022, and not being particularly computer savvy, I was having trouble accessing my IRA account online. I called the customer service desk and, after an hold of about 15 minutes or so I was able to speak with a very professional and polite representative who guided my through the process. She answered all my questions and taught me how to print a summary of my account. I was very satisfied with the interaction.Lately I am having a bit of a communication issue with MT with regards to a rollover of funds. I believe it is just a logistic glitch and I am confident that once MT and I  will work together to resolve the issue.",5

The company that was managing it wouldn’t respond or follow through with what they said they were going to send me. Then my former workplace switched companies and Millennium Trust took over. I was immediately able to access my 401k and was given the option to merge, withdrawal, or continue my account. I chose to withdrawal and received my money the same day (even though it was a Saturday and it said 1-2 business days). I’m stunned and very happy! Thank you!!!",5

I called, and after the inevitable interminable phone tree, got a person, who asked me my name and address, and I was promptly cut off.  I called again, went through the same rigamarole, and when I got a person, I cut her off, and gave her my phone number so she could call me back if we got cut off.  She told me the URL was wrong, and sent me the correct one.  After that, I was able to set up my profile.  This is not aimed only at you.

The app is very simple and easy to use!,"The website is somewhat user friendly but having to click next after each question on the forms is overkill. There’s no app that I could find. I was charged for both a transfer into millennium Trust, there a yearly fee, and another fee to transfer out. None of which I was charged for by my previous company. Because of the market right now, and your fees, I lost just under $300 in the last month on a small $2500 account balance and transferring to millennium wasn’t my choice in the first place. I’m putting my money somewhere else. Thanks.",5

The Service Rep was extremely helpful…,"The issue with the automation is receiving notification that I needed to ""log in"" to complete, but when going to the site - there were still ""holds"" so I could not log in.  Since the representatives take calls (but are not the document reviewers), what I thought would take a day or two took a little over a week. Misunderstanding of automated emails after talking to a representative led to a longer wait time for processing necessary documents to access account. All has been resolved, and the on call reps along with the quick response to the email reply corrected the situation.",5

One of the fastest and easiest experiences with customer service.,Not friendly cold and distance and I was left confused and flustered,5
Complimentary,"The last lady I spoke with on the phone was great, but the three star review is because I had called a week prior about accessing my account, and the representative I spoke to on that occasion was not helpful and seemingly did not know what they were doing. I submitted all required documentation to identify myself, but the initial information I filled out to open my account was incorrect because my place of employment filed my SSN wrong. The system did not recognize me or identify my account unless I used the incorrect SSN on file. Well after I submitted proof of my SSN I had to resubmit that request form again with the correct SSN to process my request to access my account. This person did not know, and told me everything was fine and to just wait it out.  The only reason it was dealt with properly was because I called back the following week presenting my situation again to someone else. It could have ended up much more frustrating because all of that is time sensitive and would need to be resubmitted if deadline was not met. The representative led me to believe nothing was needed further to process, which was not correct. Just seems like further training is needed for representatives, as I pay an annual fee for account management through your company.",5

Grateful,Neither the representative  or the app offered the correct solution to my issue.,5
Everything was made to understand,"The website is very slow and I've been trying to transfer my funds into a rollover IRA.  When I get to that part of the website, the website gets stuck in a loop and eventually times out.  I've tried this numberous times today and keep getting the same result.  Also, unlike other companies, Millenium wants you to initiate the transfer on the website instead of allowing you the option on the phone.  Lots of red tape and issues to make a transfer to another company a real hard and long task.  Not very customer service oriented.",5
After almost 3 months of trying to gain…,"I had all kinds of glitchy problems trying to log in. I got the help I needed to navigate, cheerfully and quickly.",5

Very excellent customer service 👏🏽,Sandra helped me get my money moved over to Fundrise.  It was not issue that Millennium Trust caused but one that was on the Fundrise end.  She helped get me in touch with the Fundrise rep and sorted it all out!!,5
The Millennium Trust customer service…,"My employer had rolled over some money from an old account I had when my mill shut down. I guess I never paid any attention to it because I didn't realize I had any money in an IRA account. Millennium Trust went out of their way and tracked down my new address (I have since moved after my mill shut down) and sent me a letter explaining that I had money in an account. I ended up withdrawing it because I already have a 401k with my current employer. But what I will say is how quick, easy and painless that process was. I'm sure Millennium Trust is a great company and me withdrawing my money is by no means a reflection of any service I received. I took it out to take care of a bill that was weighing pretty heavily on me. Their letter explaining everything came at a time when I really needed it. I appreciate them reaching out and I have nothing but good things to say.",5

Very easy to cash out,"Horrible customer service!  Went to transfer funds to my self-directed LLC and needed to fill out Purchase Direction form along with Fee Compensation Letter and wiring instructions.  I sent it all in and received an email from David thanking me for sending it all in along with a request for me to call in and verify the wiring instructions.  All good so far.  But then when I called in, David claimed he never received it.  So I asked him, why did you send me an email saying you received it?  To which he replied he must have lost it.  Are you kidding me?  So I sent it again, he received it, he verified the wiring instructions and told me it would be processed that day (Friday).  Well it wasn't processed.  So on Monday morning I called and talked to Melanie and she talked to Sarah in Processing, and they assured me it would be processed by end of day.  Well, end of day came and went, still not processed.  So I called again, after talking to Melanie, she put me through to Sarah who explained she didn't get to it.  Again, are you kidding me?  I've now been told that it will be processed tomorrow.  We'll see...",5

Now I have access but I don’t like to get pushy to have someone listen.",5
Quick response,"The online platform is horrible. I STILL don't know how to access a monthly statement. You automated phone service was so bad, i requested communication via e-mail. At one point, I was asked to provide a password I was never given. When I did speak with a human being, she was helpful, and professional. I don't understand why trying to consolidate this puny IRA has been such a headache.",5
my review,No one notified me of creating account when I received the letter it was 3 weeks after account being created. Making it so I would not be able to get my full investment. The letter states within 7 days the company is sure to notify you by mail well after receiving and setting up account.,5
My representative was kind,Overall Account lookup process was simple! Website is laid out very well and easy to follow!,5
Quick turn around!,I think your processes are too slow. I also think we should be able to set up a speedier system once cash hits our account to be transferred out. We seem to be paying for a trustee service that doesn't provide a good customer experience,5

Great Company,"Two of the representatives that I talked to were very rude and didn't seem to care about helping me. I was having trouble confirming my identity even though I had submitted my documentation via the website and had saved the tracking numbers. It was evident that both representatives hated their job and weren't even remotely interested in trying to help me find a solution. When they explained what went wrong, it was difficult to follow. It didn't seem to me like they were well trained because they fumbled over their words. However, I do have to give kudos to Grear. She was amazing! We lost connection once, and she called me back right away. While one of the rude representatives did not call me back when either she hanged up or lost connection.",5
MTrust Company (Millennium),I appreciate the timely and accurate level of service.  Thanks!,5
I would 100% recommend MillenniumTrust…,"I requested the money in my IRA and I completed the online application. I was honestly surprised of the simplicity of the application and the entire process in comparison to other institutions I have been dealing with. Millennium Trust responded to my request immediately and within 2 to 3 days the money was deposited directly in my account.  What was most amazing they sent me emails to keep me updated and tracking number in the event I needed to follow up, but there was no need to contact them again.  The process was brief and hassle free from start to finish.  Thank you.  What a great experience.",5

The person I talked with was helpful,"I feel that I have been cheated, swindled and robbed. Millennium Trust took my savings, pocketed a huge percentage without any reasonable explanation, and deposited only a small fraction of those funds into my account. This is outrageous!",5
Staff was very helpful and courteous on…,"Website is not easy to navigate. I was directed to Millenium site since I resigned from my previous employer and my 401K was sent here but upon contacting customer service was given this website but no instructions on what to do for a rollover to new employer. I had to figure in my own how to navigate website & registration, etc and even at end since I had so much trouble, my new employer’s 401k company (Principal) helped me with my rollover. All this company really cares about is money they get, not customers.",3
Just because I said so,"I am trying to go to ""Distribution of Funds"" and roll over my entire fund to my current 401K plan. The website was NOT allowing me to do that. When I put in my name, year of birth and last 4 of my SS#, I click on CONTINUE and the website keeps on cycling, coming back to the same exact spot as before. Having spoken to one of your representatives about 2 weeks ago, she had no idea as to how to help me. Hence, I was stuck and not being able to advance here.Finally, I talked with another rep and she cancelled my older request, replacing it with the new one. I am thankful to the support staff and satisfied that it fixed the issue, but it could have been a less frustrating experience for me if it was fixed earlier. Also, I believe there may be a possible software bug with this issue I was experiencing.",5

My principal amount was low, and there is no mechanism for them to see that they have TAKEN ALL OF ONE'S MONEY; and they do not seem to care.This is outrageous and it must be called to the attention of regulators and legislators.  It may not bother someone with a huge principal amount, this happened to be a small one - IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE AND MORALLY BANKRUPT. I have asked for the fees to be replaced to my account.  Of course there would be no appreciation as they kept siphoning out as much as they could.  OUTRAGEOUS.",4

After a couple days MT informed me they had sent my money to the bank, so I waited a day or two and contacted my bank. The bank said the money had not been sent. After emailing back and forth I was able to get Brenda, an actual human from MT, on the phone. Brenda informed me that MT sent my money to my bank and the bank sent it back to them, it will be $30 charge for having to send it twice. Okay whatever fine, just send it again. They said they needed me to send them a voided check to make sure the account number and all is correct. So I sent the check to them last week and have sent a couple follow up emails. No response from them since I sent the check. So now MT has my retirement money AND my bank information. If I don't hear back soon I guess I will have to close my bank account and open a new one. Then hire a lawyer to get my money from them. As far as I can tell, this company sucks.",5

Very Helpful and friendly,I was having a hard time logging in and creating a profile and the customer service rep was so helpful polite professional and made everything so simple.,5

Good customer service and very helpful…,My transfer was completed within 2-3 days. Happy customer,5
The transaction was quick and easy,"Your company has never reached out to me to see how I feel about my investment. I have to reach out to you, I suppose in some world that makes sense. Especially since I have consistently lost money. Anyway ,maybe you do better with millionaires. To bad as I have several investments and this one is very small thank goodness.",5
Thanks for the speedy response,"Submitted a request to transfer some funds to my Schwab account, not the first time.  Received an email asking me to contact the company.  Called and waited on hold for over 15 mins, spoke with the rep.  She asked some questions and said the funds would be released.  A few weeks later Schwab called me and said the transfer had been declined until l contacted Millennium.  Called them back, been on hold for over 1/2 and hour...   Ridiculous.",5
Great Customer Service,Less than 24-hour turnaround for an online request. Very happy with the service.,5

Great Service....NEVER heard of comany BUT would recommend!!!!,I’m waiting to receive a payout of my retirement funds from Wilbur Smith Associates as requested on 3/4/22 but the process was easy and the people were helpful.,5
Nina Review,"The most confusing and ridiculous process of trying to get my money sent back to me. Vague and evasive. Seems as though under the guise of security they make it so aggravating that you will hopefully leave your money there for them to profit from. It took over 45 minutes just to register and I still don’t have a definitive idea as to when the funds will be returned to me. Frustrating to say the least. Don’t call the either, they’re rude and less than helpful when trying to figure out how to request a simple payout. They also try to say it will take an additional 20 days to do anACH transfer which is absurd, nothing takes that long anymore. It’s a stall tactic to keep their bank account fat for interest sweeps.",5
They help me step by step,Needing distribution of IRA to bank account. Everyone at Millennium was very helpful in guiding me through the online process. Thank you very much to everyone.,5
Awesome experience,very easy to work with and quick response,5

Easy to contact and all requests…,Easy to work with and got things done quickly for me!,5
I was trying to rollover my retirement…,All this company did was take my money in fees.  It went from almost 1000 to 589. They didnt make me any money and wouldn't transfer my money to another retirement.  So I just took it out.  Ridiculous!!,5
Helpful and the process was fast.,"I had recently left my employer, and had honestly forgotten about my investments, so they were turned over to Millennium Trust, and put into a ""holding account"". I had spoken to, only two people that, first explained what had happened, and where they were, and the second, took all of my information that she needed to liquidate my savings to me, and it only took 2 days, if I remember correctly, that it was in my bank account, so firstly, I would like to thank you for people are knowledge about your services, and also their customer service, that I received, because they were both very pleasant. I would definitely recommend Millinium Trust to my colleagues and friends.",5
Very excellent customer service,Have not been able to get ahold of someone for a week now. Called during hours and it said the best time to reach us is 5p-8p cst for now you’ll have to talk to the robot and the robot couldn’t help.

Response was timely and appropriate,"I had to call a representative 3 times today and each time they seemed competent and patient. My 4 stars is not at all related to them (they all get 5+ stars), but the website was at times difficult to navigate and created more stress than what was needed",5
Getting answer,"Not your customer service support. Your personal verification process. Provided all personal information and was not enough. I do not have the luxury of time.

Excelent service and faster answers.,Obtaining access to account was way too complicated and customer service representative was not willing to help making things difficult. I was provided with the wrong information several times and they did not want to take ownership of the misinformation that was provided. Overall I would not recommend Millennium Trust to anyone and will not use in the future.,5
Shockingly efficient….,not the easiest site to use and communication sucks when needing stuff to finish starting account.,5
Great customer service,I spoke with a lady named Vicki from Chicago and she was impersonal and repeated questions like a robot. We got conveniently disconnected( I am quite sure she hung up on me) and I called back and talked to a guy named Tim I think from Pittsburgh. He was helpful but at a certain point he seemed to just want to get off the phone with me. Vicki could use some sensitivity training. She did not make me feel like doing business with Millennium Trust in the future. Tim was much kinder.,5
The site was easy to navigate and I was…,"I am so happy to write a review about the Customer Service Rep/Analyst who helped me today on 3/25/2022 at around 9:15am.Her name is Alicia and she was absolutely wonderful. She was friendly, attentive, and listened to my needs as a customer. This is absolutely the type of service I want when I speak to a rep. I worked in retail for 8 years, then in insurance for many years, and I completely understand how difficult it is to deal with customers sometimes. I am going through the process to register my 2 types of accounts which were automatically moved over to Millennium. (Roth and Regular)So far so good. I will wait for the next email.Please thank Alicia for her kindness and also laughter during the morning Friday hours.Sincerely,Gabrielle Brieger",5

Fine job,Automated assistance sucks!  Glad to be closing out account.,5
Excellent,So many awkward and inadequate processes and communication failures over the past year. Immensely long wait times on the phone for more months that the pandemic justified. Lousy website. MT had poor communication with the holder of my metals and someone screwed up on a (test) distribution I made. Once I figured out things were not being handled well on either end I reluctantly decided to take a full distribution of the account which I would not have done but MT and the metals holder worked so poorly together. When I set the account up some years ago Millennium was the recommended custodian of HAA but they ended that relationship leaving me stuck with you.,5

The operator on the phone was very…,"If find it ironic that Millinium Trust can easily take $35 dollars from my IRA each year without even speaking to me but it's like pulling teeth to process a transfer of MY funds to another established IRA at my bank. I spoke to an associate today that required me to process everything online even though I was actually speaking to him over the phone. This was inconvenient and ridiculous! You just don't want to let go of money that belongs to me. Millinium needs a better process for fund transfers. Now I have to pay a $30 fee to process this. Didn't I just do all the processing myself over the phone and online? Furthermore, I had to use a computer Instead of my phone despite the many text prompts providing 6 digital codes for identity protection. Why don't you just face time me and I could hold up my driver's license and have the safest process ever. You do realize computers get hacked as well right? What an ordeal.

Very patient and helpful representative,"My money was moved here by a previous employer I worked for which had closed. The only communication Millennium had with me was a mail out telling me my funds were moved to them and how much they received. They took quiet a chunk of my money considering they have done NOTHING to communicate with me regarding my funds or my investments. I’ve received less than $1 in over a year being with them. They take a chunk of fees annually, but I have less than $1 dividends so they, in essence will eventually take ALL of my money if I stay with them. My opinion is if they are going to receive people retirement money and take a chunk from it then they need to be more proactive at communicating to those people about they money and how they can help with investments; otherwise, they have not earned those large fees they are so happy taking!No message has been received and communion should have happened prior to my account sitting for so long while only receiving less than $0.30 monthly in dividends.",5

Fix this.Thanks for the good service otherwise.",5

I did so and was surprised to be transferred to a representative after giving my proper information.  The person I talked to revalidated my information and asked me how she could help.  I told her I had three questions about my RMD process.  She was able to pull up my transactions and my request and told me my answers. I asked another question and she told me she would put (calls or emails) out to someone who had more information.  She soon got a response and answered my question. I thanked her.

The fact that their automated systems repeat this claim over and over again as you punch through to reach a true human being to request information that only that person has access to is proof that this company does not value your time at all. Too bad that companies such as this do not realize that automation is not the solution to all of their manpower needs. Once I did reach a human, I was able to pose my questions and obtained satisfactory answers. The person on the other end of the line was polite, responsive to my questions and was quick to find the answers to the questions I posed.",5

I got a very different experience with the manager that Valle d me than with the rep i got calling in.   If you are comfortable watching and managing your own funds they may be a good fit for you. My retirement was forced into this company when my past employer filed ch 11.   They ignored my finds for years and then when i went to move them into another actual retirement fund forced me to open an online account at a charge of 30.00. Tuen they charged me (all in one transaction)  25.00 to cpose that account.    They held it as cash and charged high fees for not growing my money.   Do not use this company.

When I wanted to TIAA to have control and move if from this company to TIAA, it was noted it was in a 403(b)-plan due to it was a university. However, no one from MT noted that MT changed the account I have in the 403(b) to a Traditional IRA and took $35 for a fee. TIAA sent me 3 letters telling me MT would not transfer the money. When I called MT, they said that TIAA was seeking a 403(b)plan and it is now a Traditional IRA and I asked who decided this and why has no one contacted of this. It finally got cleared up, but very disappointed with the LACK of communication where TIAA would not be able to get the account since I had to claim the account. Again, no one told me I had to claim my money. Assine the entire process and lacks professionalism the company and its processes. On 3/16/2022, Myra called me and now tells me, there is MORE confusion, how can this be Myra? You are the one who explained me to have TIAA change the verbiage of 403(B) to Traditional IRA in the transfer form which we did. The paperwork should be coming to MT next week so the Traditional IRA can be moved finally to TIAA.  Apparently, the 403(B) money was dropped into MT in December 2021 by the University, and I am hearing about this now?",5

Great!,I was impressed that the agent that I spoke with scheduled a follow-up call for the next day and kept that appointment. That meant that I did not have to call the general customer service number and then go through all of that waiting. As a result my concern was easily and quickly resolved.,5
Really Easy To Use,My problem is not so much with the company as the customer service. This is an account which I had totally forgotten about until I received an email about it. I had forgotten my password and requested a reset. Response was that I would receive an email with a link to do so. Never received it. Resorted to calling them on several occasions and was on hold for 45 minutes to no avail. This has happened over the course of about a week and a half with no resolve,4

Thanks for helping out to sending my…,This firm f%*king sucks. My employer's IRA plan was through them and it's an awful experience. So many fees and they do not let you choose your investment fund. Once I quit they failed to notify me they started charging me additional account fees and they were so hefty I wound up losing 45% of my account contribution value and cashed out the IRA early with the IRS penalty to avoid them. F*#k Millenium. The reviews here speak for themselves. NEVER trust these b*stards with your money. They will take every penny. Use Vanguard or Charles Schwab instead!Update:I have been contacted about having these fees refunded. If this is the case in the next few business days I will be updating this review as that would be a major step in the right direction and a positive outcome to this experience.,5

I did the online chat..none of the options helped me. I became very frustrated and closed the chat. That was back in January. I really needed to get this taken care of so I tried again, in March. Again, the number was of no use. I sent an email. I then tried the online chat. Went thru all the options, again none were helping me. Finally, I typed in help and FINALLY..i was ""chatting"" with a person. Her name was Terri. Thank goodness for Terri. She was able to find the problem and she sent me a link to correct the problem. I gave a low rating because it took me h.o.u.r.s! to just find a way to contact a live person.

I was told if I had questions to call but it took me so long to get a response that calling is insane.

Why would you call my cell phone when I made it explicitly clear to your agent (in a well documented conversation) that my phone is NOT WORKING and I cannot use it. Thus why would you contact me via the phone and then recommend me to call you. It's absolutely amazing the incompetence level",5

I may have been missing part of the information each time I tried.

i likes the ease of their website,Thanks. Most helpful!,5
Great help,I closed a 401k from a previous employer. I called to ask for information on how to close it and the woman who answered walked me through how to answer the questions. They also had a video you can view beforehand so you can prepare for what questions you need to answer. They were very friendly and respectful.,5
For a first time contact.,My former company rolled my account over to you without my permission. I sent paperwork directing them to roll over to another company. So I have been charged an annual fee of $30.00 without my knowledge or permission. I will also be charged $25.00 to close out the account when the correct company activates the transfer which will close out my account. This is a horrible practice. I will not ever recommend this company after my business transaction is completed.,5
Guy who I spoke with was very short,This company is so easy to work with. I was able to distribute my old 401k to myself within 2-4 business days. I’ve never seen another company like Millennium! Glad I could experience a simple company in such a complicated world. Thank you M Trust!,3

Easy to use process,Haven't gotten the invite to get access to my money!! My new phone number is 5053182957. Can you please update it for me. Thanks,5
She is very helpful,"Outrageous and hidden fees make leaving money with this company foolish.  Their website is very hard to navigate, requires many needless (but required) steps to login and is misleading.  The phone lines have crazy long wait times with long and redundant phone trees.  All of it seems designed to make getting access to your account extra hard.  Any funds left with them dwindle away due to the fees.  Even getting it transferred out costs fees.  The fees are so out of control, it feels unethical.   I am angry at my employer for doing business with this company as I lost about 2.5% of my money in fees as soon as it was deposited here.",4

I selected the options to withdraw my money and in less than 5mins, I was done.

I submitted it again and it went through. I was then told to resubmit my drivers license. I explained that I was broke, and that that was one reason the supervisor had ok'd it.

The representative that helped me was…,Can't recommend Millennium Trust. They seem scammy from the get go.  Charge ridiculous fees. Make it hard to transfer my account to another provider.  Odd business hours. Gray UX patterns on their website.  Long wait times. When I did talk to someone they said they would send an email.  The email did not help and has only put me back at square one.  All done to intentionally making it difficult to get away from them.  No wonder they have only 1/5 stars from the BBB.,5
They are always there to help me,I was on hold after being transferred to agent . Never got to speak with someone !,5

They don't reach out to you to see if you have questions. They do absolutely nothing other than charge ridiculous fees while your account earns $1 or so, if you're lucky. Happy to be moving it over to a place that will actually invest it for me and  help me grow it rather than taking it all for themselves.Edit to respond to their response: That doesn't change the fact that Millennium does nothing but nickel and dime their customers to provide ZERO service. Still glad I am moving away from them.",5
Great service!,"I have been with Millennium for about 10 years.  For many years they were great and had wonderful customer service and response time.  However, MTC, like just about every other company in the US that isn't a mom and pop organization, have gone to the default model of not hiring adequate staff.  I have needed to contact them twice in the last few days, and have waited on hold in excess of 45 minutes on both occasions.  This is not on customer service people but on management.  To my way of thinking, wait times of over 15 minutes are absolutely unacceptable.  HIRE SOME MORE PEOPLE!!!",5

I needed to claim a ira from a old job,"I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone based only on that they are incredibly hard to get in contact with. That alone was enough to make me withdraw my funds and deposit my funds elsewhere. It took me an entire 2 weeks of calling daily, leaving messages before I was able to get through to someone after a nearly 45 minute wait on hold. they have your money, they should make speaking with them a breeze.  If you are not interested in ever speaking to someone at this company then this is the place for you, but if you value your investment and want to talk to someone I HIGHLY recommend you look elsewhere.",5
Fantastic Customer Service,"This company took over the 401k after a former employer decided to use them. By the time this happened, I had already resigned from my position and moved to another state to attend graduate school. The Millennium Trust Company sent a letter to my former address informing me that my money had been moved to them. After years of NO REPLY from me, no one from this company thought it best to try to reach out to me by any other form. No one searched for a death certificate or anything to know why I was not responding. Worst, while the money was sitting here for about 4 years, they were taking ""admin charges"" or ""maintenance charges"" from the little money that I had no idea was with this company. My money had been sitting at this company for years and by the time I got a letter on the off-chance I returned to my previous address just a few weeks ago, I learned that the money that had originally been with the company had dwindled to roughly 1/2 of the original amount because of the fees they were charging for just holding my money, not even investing it or doing anything with it. No one decided to track me down via any other means except by letter, which was being sent to my parent's address, where I had not lived in years! If this were the other way around and I OWED this company money, I would get calls, emails, and all other forms of communication from this  company so they could recoup their funds. This company preys on the unresponsive nature of their ""clients"" in order to steal from them! I WILL MAKE SURE TO NEVER RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY TO ANYONE. ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.",5

Thank you for your transfer funds,"i called Millennium Trust at the beginning of this month to find out information on how to withdraw a very small amount of money I have had with the company as I continued to be charged a yearly service fee.  Lady was very abrupt and told me to figure it out online in which I tried.  With hearing nothing back I called again this morning to have the woman on the phone be nothing but polite, compassionate, kind and patient to explain to me that when I went online I did not complete the process and walked me through to the very end exactly wanted needed to be done.  If the first Lady was a 1/4 of what the women was today in our world it would have made a simple task not so complicated, confusing, frustrating and lost still waiting for a response from your company.

Not only did I never receive information from them about the status of them taking over my funds, but when I finally found out they had them, the process to try and make an account to get funds back has been painstaking. I am over a week into making the account and still haven't received the verification to access what to do with my funds. 0/5 stars.",5
Your website was helpful.,This was a bad experience!! I tried calling just to simply roll over my 401 to my present job and they said call back later lines were too bad so I went online but it kicked me off so I called then they said I was already registered but I couldn’t get on it to roll it over !!!! Total disaster and a waste of two hours of my time,5

"The ""How To"" needs to be improved on…","Called MT as a new client for help accessing their website and my new account. I could not establish access therefore could not peruse the site and my new account. When I called, Bruce the initial customer service rep was nice and pleasant but could not help me so transferred me to another department. The recorded message gave me the option of holding to talk to a rep or pressing 1 to leave a message.  I opted to hold but within seconds I was hung up on. I called back 2 more times and was hung up on both times. Finally, I called back and used the leave message option and was told someone would return my call within 24 hours during normal business hours. We'll see ......",4

I was concerned it would take a long…,"This company bought out my existing 401k company. And they have seriously been THE WORST. Absolutely impossible to create an online account. Customer service phone number just refers you to use the online account that you can't set up. The only way I got to speak to an actual representative was to say I wanted to open a new account. Even then, it took 6 emails from the representative to complete the one single form I needed to transfer my money out of their service. Then I had to pay a fee just to get my money transferred from a company I didn't want to use anyway! Just stay away.",5

I had recently left my employer,"First things first, I did not choose this company. A leftover bit from a 401K with a previous employer was sent here by that employer.Fortunately it was not a lot of money, because Millennium Trust took over 80 percent of it in fees.This particular transaction was my cashing out what little was left, and that part went smoothly, so there were no issues with that.",5

From a financial standpoint, while it doesn't necessarily make sense to close an account, it also doesn't make sense to continue eroding the existing asset over time. Thus the reason for closing the account.",5
Amazing process.,"The Web site & user interface worked fine but has a dated feel. It gives the impression that the technology used behind the scenes at Millennium may also be dated. It doesn't build confidence that the company is using modern approaches to shepherd people's assets or that they are safe & secure, tech-wise, from cyberattacks / cybercrime.",5

Great Company,"Had a paltry sum in my savings plan with another company. It got transferred to MT after I left my job, charged a $75 transfer fee. I leave it for a couple years, somehow not making even modest returns, and am losing money instead. I’m irritated, cancel the account, charged a $25 fee for a transferred account I never even wanted to be transferred. At this point I have around half of what I started with from fees, losses, and punitive closing because this company is a nightmare. Thanks.",5

"....,","If you can get someone of the phone to assist, it normally works out ok, maybe with some unneeded additional hassle, but it works. Nothing is simple or inexpensive. But getting someone on the phone is an issue. My recent experience causing this poor rating relates to my attempt to call them to discuss what looks like a double fee billing per our most recent account statement. After waiting a long time to get a human, I was told that she was not the right person to speak with so I was placed back on a very long hold, which I eventually hung up on. So I emailed in my issue. The response I got back was to call them since they could not discuss account info over an email communication. This is very far from good customer service.",5

I had been speaking to the machine for longer than I had to wait for a representative who was virtually no help as they told me to just log on to complete a form, which I told them the system wasn’t letting me access. It was clear they would be no help so I tried to log in again and the system doesn’t even have the form I was directed to fill out.",5

The gal I had was extremely patient n…,"I understand “bad” is the option I selected. I wish there was a selection worse than bad. I am in disbelief in the level of accountability this company and its representatives have in helping the consumer. I was told by a supervisor Yesenia P. that it was MY responsibility and the organization does not bare a fiduciary responsibility to the customers because the account was transferred to Millennium Trust from my previous employer. There was no attempt to empathize or understand the situation from the customer viewpoint. I understand parameters and guidelines are created for the best interest of the company, but the customer loses when there are charges put an account every year for 10 years without the customers knowledge nor authorization. I will never do business with a company that values their bottom line and forgoes the customer experience. Maybe losing one more customer does not impact you but the treatment I have received will have a lasting impression on me, my family and every person I tell this story to.Update: when I titled this review as “Disingenuous Representatives” I was referring to the few that I have come in contact with. After speaking with the manager Mike P, I am beginning to think that is the culture of Millennium Trust. Mike P. did not reach out to me to provide help, he wanted to further explain why the company is justified in charging me hundreds of dollars. The justification was: 1) address search they conducted (hard to believe when information is readily available with today’s technology), 2) having the ability to access my account online (even though I never used the service), and 3) the funds were held in their institution (even though I am responsible in managing my own account for any gain). The most insulating part of the conversation is when he offered to waive my fees to close my account. I am not aware of any financial institution that charges $20 because they can not send you a statement, $40 annually because the funds are sitting in an account they do not manage, and $25 to close the account.  The intent of this organization is to deplete the account by any means available. Per Mike P. they will keep charging fees until the account is at a zero balance. This organization doesn’t seem to have an escheatment process, it charges fees until there is no funds left. Why would anyone want to be a customer when their intent is clear.",5

Wonderful Customer service,"These guys are a royal waste of money. They did absolutely nothing except take money in fees. I took my money out, put it in a Robinhood account and am getting waaay better returns than Millennium Trust. Word of advice: Take your money out and open an account with Robinhood, WeBull, ETrade, etc and put your money in an EFT (if you're uncomfortable investing in individual companies). Mutual funds are managed by a person and you will be charged fees. An EFT is managed by an AI and there are no fees. So the management of the fund has no self-interested bias.Save yourself money and leave these guys.",5

The young man from Chicago help me…,"This has been the most disappointing experience I’ve encountered in all of my financial dealings.  While the personnel were polite, the process is extremely difficult and appears to be geared to obstacles in requesting ones distribution. What’s tragic is in this case we are speaking of under 2,000.00 which I’m sure is nominal in most dollar amounts. Recently I’ve had the experience of dealing with the New York Life Annuities Group and was truly treated professionally, equipped at every juncture to access what was mine, and then offered investment options for consideration. And truthfully they were dealing with over 300,000.00 rather than a mere 1600.00. Night and day is what I would call this experience. The customer service was professional, personable, helpful at every turn with even a follow up two days later to be sure I was pleased with their service and the outcome of my decisions (NY Annuities Group)   And then compare the pervious to this…from the Millennium Group:    The response was simply all of our processing is done online and we don’t have the ability to help you (Milllenium group).

Great Customer Service,The fees are often and high. I never wanted to do business here it was an ira rollover from a previous employer. No one should willing want to do business with a company who wants to fee their customers to death.  Even to close account yet another fee. They should be investigated and no one should do business with them. Called to talk to someone its 100% automated and to transfer funds takes forever you have to do it online only. This place needs to go out of business. Hope people files complaints with the district attorneys.  I see the same reply about fees to all. That's why I roll everything to etrade no BS fees like this scam company. They only want to charge fees and suck you dry look at the reviews over and over and over again.,5

Everything I asked was answered and…,"I was new to Millennium Trust because an account with a former employer was rolled over to them.  I appreciated TMT's diligence in reaching me about this account. Once they found me it took several months to get my account open due to some technical glitch and reps kept sending me the same non working solution.  When I was able to reach a person, several months later I was talked into how to solve the glitch and that was great customer service.  I then received another communique about stuff I had to do to verify the opening of my account. Annoying. Did that. Get into my account to see the amount that's been rolled over.  Too small to leave with MTM, BUT I loved how the site worked once inside. Decide to get distribution of that amount but want to keep the TMT for other funds I'd load later in the year.  Getting the distribution, which I want to invest elsewhere I have to leave $200 in or forced to close the account.  I don't like that, decide to take the full  distribution. TMT charges me $25 to close the account I'm forced to close! That feels predatory....Dang, thought this company would be a strong solution to other funds I want to invest.  NOT going to happen because, in the end of all things, too difficult to access and sign up for funds they have told me are in their holdings for me, then too difficult to keep a relationship that I would have wanted with the company going. Not a problem, I have other investment companies that don't have this difficulty or exorbitant fees to the client for following policies the company has put into place in order to have a relationship with its client.",5

Asking them for their assistance, since they put me on hold to contact the personnel which could get the job done.  I appreciate the concern they showed to me and help they gave me.",5
Very clear and helpful!,In all honesty this is a great company to have an investment in! The reason I only rated them with 3 stars is for a couple reasons. First: There is a penalty for early withdrawal for anyone under 59.5yrs old. -What if you become disabled and ‘like me’ are forced into early retirement before that age?? Secondly: Trying to take personal control of your account in order to have access to ‘your own money’ is like trying to fit a camel through the eye of a needle. Way to many hurdles to jump through in my opinion. If either of these two things aren’t a real concern for you them yes I definitely recommend using MillenniumTrust for any and all your future investments.,5

Then in order to have my account opened and closed within a few minutes I was charged both an annual fee as well as an account closing fee. This is ridiculous. There was no work or effort done. I had your account for a total of 5 minutes yet you justify taking $55 out of my money for what exactly. This is a total joke and would never even considering investing with you guys. Apart from that tried to use your customer chat which is not a chat. It is is simply a commonly asked questions search. Then emailed your company 3 separate times and have yet to receive a single response yet it says you will contact same day or at latest 24-48 hours later. Horrible service,5

I received a letter in the mail from them didn't know them and had never heard of Millennium Trust I actually started to throw the letter in the trash thinking it was a scam and I looked at it again and Googled them checked the B.B.B on them and then called them. They were exceptionally nice. When it comes to money changing hands you have to be wise. In this case I'm thankful they researched and found me after several moves on my part. Very highly recommend this company. I hope everyone can have the same experience as I did with them. 10 stars everyone at Millennium Trust.  Oh and I'm not an employee or friend I'm for real just a working single cautious woman. Thank you  for all you did for me Millennium Trust 🙏 Valarie,5

Considering that they are a company handling my money, they were evasive, oppositional, and used circular conversation tactics to not deal with my problems. My money was transferring from my 403 b into an IRA with them and I wanted to move it back into my work account. It appeared they hired specifically trained people to work to not make this happen, and to make it so difficult to move money out of their company that the customer would just give up. Since I want my money with a company that I feel I can trust, they did everything I can think of that would make me not trust them.",5

Every attempt to close the account or transfer the funds to an actually trusted company was slowed down by MT to the utmost degree. Over 8 hours were spent on hold trying to get answers or information, and to add insult to injury when the complete extrication from MT finally got worked out the company had to act as vampirically as possible and suck as much money from the account as possible with the account closure fee.",5
They helped me thank you,"Ridiculous and painful, frankly.  It appears obvious as to why you drag people through such a tedious and arduous process but I suppose you don't care a single iota while you sit back and collect fees (penalties) while the accounts sit idle.   Most people, myself included, don't have time to deal with the process, especially for such a minimal amount that we either dismiss it or eventually get around to it when we receive a year end statement, in my case this has been sitting in your account for 3 years. I suspect you all sleep well at night.  Sleep tight :-)",5
My experience with your firm was very helpful and appreciated,Utterly useless.  All I needed was a 1 page statement faxed or mailed and they couldn't do it.  Then talking about charging me $25 for it.  I didn't choose you for some reason Trans America transferred my account.,5

Great,I experience several things when I found out that a precious company that I had work for had moved my 401K account to Millennium Trust.  I first had to upload a lot of my personal information to be able to see what was in my account and this made me uncomfortable.  due to so many scams going on.  Then I kept getting information back stating that some of my documents were either not readable or not acceptable.  So then I had to try to reach out to the company to see who I could talk to assist me so I could get through this problem.  Once I was able to talk to an representative I was able to finally get through the initial login to setup an account.    overall the site was easy to use and request for information.,5

To be honest, I don't know if that's Millenium Trust's fault, or a symptom of the general financial industry. If you have a rollover account with them, all I can say is be proactive, read every word of everything they send you, and don't assume anything.",5
Very knowledgeable and professional,"Great, easy, simple",5
Good service,"To whom ever this concerns:I met the Millennium Trust personnel through my employer... and I have to say that Millennium Trust has treated me with respect..., and the patience that was needed; because of the fears that I had from the experience I gained through my previous employer, that fear was derived form the transferring of my money or let’s say savings, to someone other than myself.So you do realize that something was gained by the transfer that I didn't think was possible, until now.THANKS!Millennium Trust and keep up the ""GOOD WORK""!Just for the record I plan to become a ""MILLIONAIRE INVENTOR ""!",5
No issues or problems,The wait on the phone was way too long for them to tell me a 5 min answer to my question.,5
Awesome,"re; Robert Sundeen Millennium Trust account #1v73REF753679.  Please request Millennial Trust contact me at 1847-927-3100 regarding the reason for my calls placed today. Extremely important.Called the 630-386-5600 twice today.  This morning, first time calling was on hold listening to your sales pitch for around 30 minutes.  Then I chose to leave a voicemail then was told I would get a call back.  That never happened.So I called back at 3 PM CST, 4 EST.  Once again, I am on hold so far for 40 minutes, then requested a call back. That is terrible service.  I need to speak only with a person who issues the 1099-R for account holders.   I received, incorrectly,, a 1099-R showing $136,067.50 a distribution for tax reporting.  When in fact no $ funds where distributed in that amount.  I simply had Cytometix issue a stock certificate equal to the number of shares of Cytometix stock that Millennium Trust had been holding in my account.  So no transaction took place.  Once Cytometix company advised Millennium Trust that that had issued a stock certificate to me, my account was then closed. I need Millennium Trust tax / accounting department to send a new ""corrected"" or reverse the 1099-R for no distribution of funds took place.  Instead at my request, Cytometix company contacted Millennial Trust to let it know that they were issuing a stock certificate for the amount of my share holding.   So no 1099-R is required since no transaction or funds distribution took place through Millennium Trust.   I am holding the stock certificate that was issued by Cytometix.  Unfortunately there is no market for selling my shares, which make them actually worthless.I did also receive 1099-R for cash, $236.36, that was in my Millennial Account.  When I closed my account Millennium Trust sent me a check for   $236.36.  The 1099-R is correct.",5

One day recently I decided to look into my funds only to find out I was being charged $40 annually for maintaining an open account with a very minimal return on my IRA that I lost about $200! To make things worse, the little money I had left was charged another $10 fee just to close the account.",4

You make your website so cryptic and information unavailable.  Try to reach a live person for help is a joke.  So glad to have removed our funds from your company.Update 1/21/2022: I received your reply to my review.  Thank you.  I see you acknowledged you have fees associated with each account.  What you failed to acknowledge is how ridiculously high the fees are in comparison to other companies.  Not to mention how difficult you make it to request a disbursement.  We did not choose you...our previous employer did.  Thus, the ""benefit"" was to you for being able to bleed your clients account with such high fees.  Again, I am GLAD to have removed our funds from your company to a new funds manager.",5
easy to use site,"Phone service people were unable to identify funds coming into their company for an extended period of time. Multiple calls back and interaction from 401k administrator involved finally identified the funds. 10 days after transfer was made to Millenium, a form was mailed to me at mercy of the US mail. Registered for online account which took days to be available. I am moving monies before I get same lack of timeliness and knowledge on day to day investing.UPDATE: I received a call from Millenium and individual was truly concerned about the comments I left behind. He explained Millenium's process to use these comments to improve. Frankly it was impressive and took the edge off of my feelings on Millenium. I answer all surveys I am asked to complete- good or bad. I did not know companies followed up on bad surveys- good for Millenium as that is how a company gets better.",5

Great customer service.,Too much documentation via email to receive my money.,5
The agent was very friendly and…,I have no feelings bad or good for Millennium Trust. An old employer made a profit sharing contribution to an old account and somehow Millennium trust got the money.  I closed my Millennium within a few weeks of opening so I could put that profit sharing into my current 401K account.,4
Good,My tiny IRA was rolled over to Millenium Trust from an old job. When I got the information to check the account I was disappointed to see the huge fees being charged to maintain the account. The fees were so large that the amount in the account was actually shrinking.,5

Awesome,"The lady I spoke to on the phone basically had me fill out the forms myself to withdraw my funds from my 401k that got transfered to your company. She was rude and had me on mute and whenever I asked a question she would respond as you see on your screen. She was being very snarky. Aside from that, although I've submitted all the information your company asked for, I have not received the transfer to my bank account as requested. It has been over 2 weeks now. I would like a status update but whenever I've called no one was there to answer my call and was on hold for a long extended time.",5

I called to ask a couple of basic…,"My experience with Millennium Trust has been horrid from my first experience about 8 years ago. While trying to claim the funds today, It took over 2.5 hours and 3 phone calls over a 4 hours period, doing the same stuff over and over and over. Finally, I had to start all over again after 2 hours of frustration to do it ""manually."" The website kept glitching out at different points. It's like the computer programmers never tested the system. I froze while trying to ""verify"" my email, spun for 5 minutes only to be told ""we're busy today. Try back again later."" So when I came back later. Then it kept hanging up while trying to verify my phone. Incredibly frustrating!I was told that Google Chrome or Safari would fix the problem onlly to have BOTH search engines give me a blank page--worse than the firefox that I was working on. If you have software that only works on certain search engines, it would be SMART to disclose that to your customers to save their time and  your employees time. I STRONGLY DO NOT RECOMMEND recommend Millennium Trust to anyone.",4
The representative was very helpful and…,The site malfunctuons a lot! One issue was when i was trying to log in to a resumed document it would load on its own non stop to staying on the questions page. One day it was slowly loading so i managed to type in my answers before loading and it took. Stuff was easy when it worked. Spoke with 2 people on issues i thought they seemed helpful but did not get me where i needed. Finally got an email that got what eaxctly what i needed so easily.,5

Easy to understand transfer of money,"Customer service was great. I gave millennium trust a bad review because they changed my previous employer's 403b into a traditional IRA, not a rollover IRA. Therefore, I was unable to roll it over into my new employer's retirement account; this obviously cost me a lot of money in penalties and taxes.",5

Quick and easy to deal with!,"THE WORST company I've ever dealt with in my life. It took EIGHT FACKING WEEKS to cash out my 401k, and the majority of verification questions were related to my mom's ex husband from 20 years ago, because we had the same last name in the 90s. When I brought this up to a rep because I literally COULD NOT ANSWER MY OWN BXLLSH!T FACKING SECURITY QUESTIONS, I was very snidely dismissed. And NOW, its taking literal weeks for the tax form I need! You'd be better off burning your money or shoving it up Jeffrey Epstein's @sshole than trusting this company at all, ever.",5

Quick excellent on line service,The worst.  Systems are antiquated.  Extremely difficult to process transfers out.  Does not participate in any of the financial institution electronic transfer systems which makes transfers very difficult.  Will only mail checks unless you pay a $30 wire transfer fee.  This is a process apparently designed to make it extremely difficult to transfer funds from Millennium to a major funds manager.MY SUGGESTION IS TO NEVER USE MILLENNIUM TRUST!,5

While trying to distribute the funds for my use, I ran into a little hick-up on the the website.  The customer service agent I spoke with was very helpful and professional.  She even emailed me some ""back up"" forms I could fill out send in if I continued to have problems on the website so I wouldn't have to call back just to get the same forms.  Only problem I have with the company is the automated assistant you get when you first call in does not give you a lot of options and really tries to keep redirecting you away from talking to a real person.  Just say ""Agent"" twice and you will get to talk to a real person, but I found it insulting when the automated assistant told me it was ""Safer"" to speak to it than a real person... implies they have mistrustful employess, not a good message to send.",5
She was very helpful,"Millennium had custody of a rollover IRA from a job I worked years ago, it wasn’t quite enough to go through the process of rolling it over, but the process of withdrawing it (wasn’t much)  was very straightforward and simple, and I had my money in two days. Thanks!",5

Still waiting to see where my fund is.,"Your fees and policies are a nightmare and anyone that does business with you is obviously getting con'd in some way. Fees to close out your account, what kind of illegal is that? This account was not even opened with my knowledge, it was transferred from a company I used to work for with a 401k I didn't even realize I had.... so for me to come to the realization I had money just sitting in an account and on top of it you (they) are going to take some out just so I can get said money is complete bullshark to me.Your reply missed my point, I was unaware an account was opened in my name and if it was up to me, I would not have obviously opened the account. The complaint is with your closing the account policy in it's entirety, especially for those employees in my exact situation. Maybe you'll consider a change in your ""fees"" not to jip people out of what's rightfully theirs.",3

Great,"Every step of using the website is bad. I still haven't even been able to access my account. The fees are ridiculous, to the point where it's literally cheaper to take the penalty for cashing out of my IRA early, even with a fee just for closing my account.Oh, and I never agreed to have an account with millennium trust. That's right, millennium trust is charging me to close an account I never agreed to open.UPDATE 1: since I can't just reply, here's my response to the ""Reply from Millennium Trust"":Regarding ""When the account gets rolled over and it moves into an IRA, it’s the individual who is responsible for the maintenance of the account."": I have no idea why you're putting this on me. How can you hold me responsible for an account you don't allow me to control?Regarding ""if you would like to further discuss fees on your account"", what is to discuss? You charged me to close my account. Your ""fee disclosure"" was quite clear about this fact. Even before then, you somehow managed to have about 10% of my money vanish before I withdrew I even saw the account. If you ever return this money, I'll update this review to reflect that you eventually did so.To anyone reading this, if you are reading this, Millennium Trust has not done so yet.UPDATE 2: ""Frank"", a manager from Millennium Trust, has now left messages for me twice and still has not left a callback number. He said on January 12 that the fees would be reversed. As of January 18, no fees have been reversed.UPDATE 3 (March 21): Millennium Trust has reversed the majority of the fees they charged.

Your company needs to have a sensitive training course, especially when you are dealing with someone Retirement benifits, instead of legal rhetric and a condensing undertone.

I am ready to retire,"The employee was rushed and rude. She did not listen to the questions being asked and often talked over this writer when clarifying questions were asked. The employee was not clear regarding her instructions often referencing more than one process at a time. The employee made disparaging comments regarding the other financial institutions process without having full knowledge of the situation. This writer had to ask for a manager in order to obtain information which this writer was not connected to at all. The employee eventually did give this writer some of the information requested after supposedly speaking to the manager.

Great customer service,401K transferred here 12/15/21 without my notification (prior company closed accounts). Have received no information from Millennium before today so had to call to find out about my account.

Fast easy transaction,"Very unhelpful/rude customer service!A previous employer had put thousands of dollars of money that I had invested into my retirement into APB Retirement. A month ago APB transferred my money to Millennium Trust without any notification to me. There was no warning that this would take place. They just withdrew the money out of my account. I spent almost 2 weeks trying to track down where the money was. When someone FINALLY got back to me and let me know it was at Millennium Trust, I contacted them (Millennium Trust). They stated they sent me a ""welcome package"" which was NEVER received. I'm currently trying to figure out how to move my money out of Millennium Trust and close the account. The customer service agent was extremely rude and unhelpful. Unbelievably horrible and sketchy experience with all companies involved. I will be reporting this to the federal SCC.",5
Amazing and easy to utilize,"My information was transferred to this company sometime along in the last two years. I did not know the account had been transferred until February 2021. I contacted the company and found that nothing has been done with the funds.  It is a cash account and has only garnered interest in the time it has been in their hands. I have not received any communication from Millennium Trust since they took over the account. Once I received the information to create an online account, I find the fees are excessive and are charged annually, or when when a transaction occurs. This means that Millennium Trust gets more of my funds than the interest being garnered. It is a no win situation in which I will be transferring my funds from Millennium soon.",5
Quick easy and understandable.,Efficient curteous informative,5
Wonderful tool even for beginners!,My account had been transferred from another investment firm to Millennium. I had so much apprehension because it had been so long that I check on them at retirement account. Would they believe me? Would they treat me skepticism? Would they be difficult? The operator/ receptionist was welcoming. I breathed a sigh of relief but was still cautious about procedures and red tape. She then transferred the call to an “agent”. His name was Bruce. To this day I can’t believe the hospitality I was given. The service was so fast. Genuine. My funds were in my bank account an hour later. Amazing. Incredible.,5
Very helpful and a great company,I was told there was money in my name from a previous company I had worked for and they put that money into Millennium Trust. When I got ahold of a representative from millennium trust they helped me very quickly with all the information I needed to provided them and the information that they had for me and I was able to get my money in less then a week! Thank you for the amazing service millennium Trust!,5

Clear and instructive website,Good service. The rep was patient and knowledgeable.,5
Awesome,"A former employer removed one of my retirement accounts from TIAA and sent it to Millennium Trust. I never wanted to do business with Millennium Trust but they had my money so I had no choice. Attempting to set up their account has been a month-long nightmare that still hasn't resolved itself; they requested that I mail a form and copies of documents to them, which I did, but they pretended to have never receive in the mail. They don't publish their toll-free number and the representatives who call you on request are not helpful. My money is being held hostage by Millennium Trust. Now I have been forced to wage a months-long battle against them to get my money out of this sketchy and untrustworthy company.UPDATE: On January 7th, Millennium's nameless truspilot hack responded to my negative comment with this statement: ""I see you spoke with Terri, one of our Sr. Specialists on 1/3/22 and she assisted you with completing your online agreement."" This is nothing but a bold-faced lie. First of all, Millennium Trust claims I spoke with a female representative named Terri on 1/3/22. I spoke with a male representative. Second, Millennium Trust falsely claims that in this conversation, she assisted me with completing my online agreement. Again, this is a lie - the man (not a woman named Terri) who I spoke with simply made excuses, holding fast to the claim that I would NOT have access to my account because the information I mailed to them had not been received three weeks after I mailed it to them.

Helpful,"CapitalOne has informed me in November that they will stop providing retirement plan services and will move my money to this Millenium Trust Company UNLESS I transfer my IRA to some other financial institution myself.So I have requested my IRA account to be transferred to another bank by submitting transfer request through that bank. They sent the paperwork  once in November, but nothing was transferred. They resent it again in mid December, no action again.I am now seeing this is as a tacit agreement between CapitalOne and Millenium Trust to get hold of clients money against their wishes.I have now consulted my lawyer and he will be filing a lawsuit in case my IRA account is moved to Millenium Trust even though I requested it to be transferred to a different financial institution.And now I am finding out that Millenium Trust Company was a few years ago involved in a ponzi scheme with IRA accounts and there were class action law suits. This is a disaster.I am sending letters to the SEC and will raise this with my contacts in the media who will follow up on this and make it newsworthy. I am not letting you touch my money.

Easy to work with,"I was told my funds were transferred from TIAA to Millennium. When I went to transfer the funds from Millennium to another IRA, the person said I didn't have an account nor any funds in it and told me to contact TIAA. TIAA told me they had sent the funds. I bounced back and forth between Millennium and TIAA and no one on either end could help me and told me to reach out to the other party for help. Each party told me it was the other party's fault. This went on for about 6 weeks until finally, someone at TIAA personally handled the situation. Finally, the funds appeared at Millennium and I was able to instigate a transfer of the funds. I STILL haven't gotten the funds transferred, but I am hopeful the process is underway.  In my opinion, after the second call to Millennium, they should have reached out to TIAA to find out what went wrong. This was exceptionally poor customer service that has kept my money out of market for 2 months now!",5

But my only experience with them is bad and their customer service rep Michele was rude as (kcuf) when I was trying to ask her questions so I understood what was going on with my account. I lost hundreds of dollars in my small retirement fund cause of the experience I had. I’m definitely not happy and I’ll definitely not recommend or be doing business with these people. It may be crappy of me. But first impressions are everything and Millennium Trust Company didn’t leave me with a smile on my face…. So take this review how you will. They asked for a survey. And I gave it to them. I actually told my partner when I hung up with the rep that she was lucky they didn’t ask me for one on the phone. Then I saw the email asking for one today….. I guess I’m still salty about everything.,5

My wife was comfortable with the meeting, Dominic has some 'homework' for us with some things I'm still tracking down. Overall, I'm looking forward to his thoughts and ideas based on our discussion. I've dreaded and procrastinated doing this for a few years now, but they were highly recommended from a long friend of ours. So, we'll see what shakes out. It was definitely a worthwhile meeting.",4

The representative I worked with via…,Total waste.  Spent 2 years with my money just sitting there while the market skyrocketed  while you charged me fees each year so I was in theory losing money.

the processed was fast and easy,"My funds were transferred from T Rose Price on 11/10/2021 via electronic transfer and for several weeks no one was able to locate the funds. I called countless times to both companies and went online but neither of you had record of the funds until 12/6/2021they suddenly appeared without any explanation to me. That's unacceptable and doesn't instill a lot of confidence in either firm. Now I find out that each of you automatically took out annual maintenance fees, them as it left and you the first day it arrived even though I never wanted you to handle my funds. In a month's time, I have paid a few of $120 in combination and I have had no say. This may be normal business practice to you but it's unfair to the client, especially the client that didn't ask to be a client and one that has been served so poorly over the last couple weeks.",5
it was hard to follow the directions.,"As a first-time user, I was having trouble accessing my account. I called 877-682-4727 and a very kind and patient person named Bruce listened carefully and walked me through everything very deftly. Thank you for not making me feel stupid. :-)",3

Easy to work with,"If I could give them a half star or less I would do so. Once my money was established in an account with MT, I was locked out for over a week from doing anything with it. They said it was due to an address change but even after that was addressed I was still locked out. I asked to get escalated to a manager to have it unlocked and the common response even from them was give it a couple hours. Another response was that I could move my money out. They failed from an IT, managerial, and customer support perspective. I would think twice about trusting my money with this company.",5

Excellent Service!,"Millennium provides very little, if any service, and only serves as a ""middleman"" for an alternative investment that is necessitated by law. And then charges what I consider to be an exorbitant fee for doing so. I'm sorry I ever went with them, but it's not worth it now to try and find another vehicle. Do yourself a favor and shop around before engaging them.",5
Great staff person assisted me on…,Everyone I spoke to was courteous and helpful.  I appreciated the fact that I didn't have to go through a complicated password ritual to identify myself.,5
Excellent service,"I sent you forms for an RMD distribution. I didn't hear anything so I called, after I repeatedly tried to do it on line, which never worked. Three times and the ""robot"" hung up on me twice, after I asked for a representative. Finally, the woman who answered told me I hadn't sent any identification. I said yes I did. And if I hadn't, Why didn't they Tell me!! After holding again, she found it then told me it was a temporary license and they couldn't use it. Retailers accept it, Police accept it! Finally she said that she ""thought"" it was ok. It was going to take awhile to get the distribution because they had to sell the stock and then issue me a check. I'm still really ticked off at your whole system and its complete lack of function. I'm still not sure I'll get my distribution at all, let alone before the end of the year. I hope so.",5
Customer service call,"I received a letter about some past employer having switched investors and letting me know I would have options with money I didn't even know was available. Although the letter included instructions that were perhaps outdated or typed incorrectly, once I emailed Millennium Trust directly, they promptly sent a helpful email with working links. The distribution ""wizard"" process was very transparent and straight-forward - the highest marks available in my vocabulary. The process walked me through step-by-step without wasting a second of my time. I really appreciate the level of care and professionalism I have seen in my brief contact with Millennium Trust and I will feel confident about any future accounts I may entrust to them.",3

Thank you!,"Rather than earning money, my retirement account lost about 9%.  This is in large part because of the excessive charges for ""taking care"" of my account, however, I don't see where any care was given other than regularly taking money out for Millennium.  I also do not appreciate that I have to give you permission to my personal information because I want to make potential clients aware of Millennium's malpractice.  As a matter of fact you do not have permission to send me anything or give out my information outside of what I am publishing in this box.

The representative was excellent,"MAC'S online site is confusing.  There is incomplete information pertaining to current statements, very little useful for  online RMD info, and I had to jump from screen to screen to find,  unsuccessfully I should add, useful information.  Trying to speak with a live contact was an effort.  Among my multiple calls, online searches, and directions from several individuals, I accomplished very little.  I was obviously frustrated, but at least one agent did not listen to what I was saying...they insisted on emailing me the RMD for even though I told him/her that I had completed the forms and needed help finding the most expeditious way to send it.  My lateness in requesting the RMD was exacerbated by the fact I had no meaningful written communications about or from MTC nor the former employer which transferred my account.I apologize for venting, but over the past few weeks I have tried to open account access, was told MTC would send me an email explaining my next steps about a week ago, and had to start all over today.",4

Fast and Easy!!,You partner with these companies and take people's money moving around without their permission or consent and then when requested to put the money back you forced him to jump through all these hoops and create all these accounts in order to even be able to look where access their money even though you were moving around without any of that same process before in order for them just to get it back you need to refine your process and streamline the ability for people to access their money and make sure that you were notifying people in advance before you start moving things around and allow it for a better system and process transfer or rollover money even with needing to be accountable to the i r s,5

I received another notification in NOV 2021. I took a chance and made the call. SURPRISE, SURPRISE. No hoax. The representative explained it was my retirement holdings from a previous employer from 1991. The rep was fantastic (I forget her name). She provided the options of keeping my retirement money with their company, rolling over to a different company, or cashing out with a penalty of being under 59 1/2. Two days from the call was my birthday. I accepted the money as a happy birthday to me. The money was EFT into my account within the hour.

"Issue quickly resolved, thank you!",Thank you for helping  customer service very good 👍 🙏,5
Millennium Trust knows how customers want to be traded,"Representative was a bit condescending. Her tone seemed annoyed and she provided limited info and little options for my concern. This company earns money by taking on rollover accounts just to charge them money for no service at all. They make you pay to close your account when it is rolled over to them without your consent, plus an annual fee. They do little to manage your account, yet they charge like you are getting an actual service from them. There is no way around their frivolous fees. They are a predatory company that takes advantage of individuals. Talk about getting money for nothing.",5

I had to call and have someone look into the issue and remove a hurdle that I did not know about. I was also appalled at the poor performance of my funds and lack of options to invest. I'll consider this a lesson learned that any large employer can choose a minimalist company to move 401k funds into. I'm beyond delighted to say my funds are being moved into my new 401k account, back with Fidelity.",5

She began with, ""I can do these in my sleep.""  I knew I had reached the one that could put up with my self-doubt.  With the weight lifted from my shoulders and all my fears gone, we took off.  She walked me through each page, section by section, ensuring thoroughness and completeness.  Answering all my questions and finding the best solution for my needs; patient & kind - customer service from the good ole days - not like today's ""this is the way it is, take it or leave it"" attitude.  And I AM the definition of customer service - my 1st career was 20 yrs in retail management...up the ladder from a 12hr/wk part timer to a District Manager in 3yrs.  Alisha would be my right hand if she were working for me.I'm hoping she reads this herself because I know public praise is few and far between.  Thank you for giving me the opportunity to toot Alisha's horn.Sincerely & gratefully,Lissie Watts",5

Easy and quick,Delores was great.  Invested her time and experience to help me navigate my on line access and gave great advice on processing my investments.,4
Nice and easy,"I have been trying for weeks, if not months, to transfer a rollover IRA to another financial institution. I have never been able to access my account online and efforts to get help from support staff went nowhere. I was told repeatedly that I would receive an email from staff with instructions to set up my online account, but no email was ever sent. Meanwhile, I have been getting paper statements from the Company indicating that no investments of the IRA were ever made, so the account never produced any returns. All the company did was continue to charge me substantial annual account maintenance fees, which only had the effect of depleting the account by hundreds of dollars over time. After repeated attempts to get help, I finally got a representative to tell me that I did not need online access to close the account and that it all could be done intra-institutionally. Hopefully that is happening now, but I have every expectation that Millennium will create yet more roadblock to get in the way. Extremely disappointed and frustrated by the overall experience.",5

My representative stayed on the phone…,"My IRA was transferred from a previous employer to millennium trust. I had since went back to school and forgotten about that IRA until I recently graduated college and found a job with benefits. When I went to roll over my IRA from millennium trust, I found out that I had to Start an account which would cost me (if I remember right) $45, and then I finally got logged in to find out It had been accruing fees for multiple years without notifying me at all. They took out over $300 of my hard earned money in fees. Rolling it over to the new employer was even a pain in the a*s. AND it involves a closing fee.  (They love to charge you)Make sure to click on the tab that says withdrawals"" instead of ""transfer out"". That should save you multiple phone calls and weeks of waiting for extra documentation that you dont actually need to arrive in the mail. I have absolutely nothing good to say about these thieves.

They transferred my account to Millennium Trust w/o proper notification. I then had to set-up my new account, just to turnaround and dissolve (close) it to acquire the funds. This process was immediately processed. I was able to obtain my funds within 24 hours. One highlight of M-Trust platform, was the option they gave me to withhold any federal and state taxes before they released my funds!! This allowed me to have a more accurate understanding or estimate of how much money I would actually be receiving AND eased my mind about paying taxes down the road. M-Trust is a great platform",5

Great,I never wanted to come over to this company. When I called to get this transferred I had to set everything up just to send it over to somewhere else. Why a rep couldn’t just email me a statement is beyond me and bad customer service. Had to call back since I didn’t know what I was doing and I got a rep that was talking to me so unprofessional. Attitude and all. I will never recommend and I can’t move my accounts fast enough.,5
Account management,Too many fees! This company will slowly suck away your funds with their fees.,3
The transfer was quick and smooth!,I called and waited 2 months for some time of response. I called again and no proper information was given. I had to apply 6 times in order to process my request. After almost two months I am able to log into my account. Please get better customer service representative. It’s frustrating being put in mute when I’m talking and having to repeat my self. Also having someone who’s a smart ass on the phone doesn't help. I’m calling because I need assistance and you are being paid to provide that. It’s ridiculous.,5

Vicky was professional and straightforward, and worked with me till I could express understanding of what she was informing me of, in terms of my options, and what was required of me to complete to make the choices I wanted to make with my account.

I had to watch the video that did show how to get to my account statements. Too many steps involved.Also when setting up the accounts, it ask if you want paper or paperless.

I processed the form while on the phone with her, providing ALL info requested, and submitted it. Weeks later...no check. I called on 10/25/21 to inquire.  The first rep I got, put me on hold for 10 minutes then disconnected the call. I called back, the 2nd rep confirmed Millenium had all info needed and didn't know why the check was held up. She ""expedited"" the distribution. As of 11/6, still no check. Working with Millenium has been a hassle for something that should be quite straight forward.",5
Your representative was very informed…,Website is easy to use and associates are extremely helpful to meet my needs.,5
No issues,Fees fees & more fees. Unfortunately my ex employers sent my retirement money to this place. Before I even knew what happened I had already been hit with fees. They split my balance in two so trying yo move it out have to pay 2 different fees as well.,5
Greer T was so helpful and pleasant!!,I spoke with a rep and asked for a form to be emailed to me to make a roll over from my Roth IRA he said he would take care of it right away when I open his email it was for a fee statement and not the form I needed!

Great staff and fast response much…,Thought your website had the feeling of a scam so bad I almost reported it as fraud. Still might based on how difficult and unnavigable the whole experience was. I couldn’t get my money out of your company fast enough without feeling a creep factor on a scale of ten. I even contacted the company I am moving my money into to make sure it was secure. My advice is make your company more welcoming without creating a feeling of having your hands so deep in my pocket in a bad touch way. The bad touch includes all the “fees” as well.,5

Gwyn is an absolute breath of fresh air.Today was indeed a glimpse into what customer service used to be. Gwyn took the time to make sure my issue was resolved, even offering additional assistance should I need to speak with her in the future. At no point during our call did I feel rushed or as if my issue couldn't be fixed. Gwyn's professionalism and ability to get to the bottom of the situation was a lesson in customer service 101.Given today's climate, a little kindness goes a long way, and as much as this has exceeded my expectations, I feel that Gwyn's commitment to excellent customer service should be commended.

MT held my money for 7 years with no interest and no investment income during the most profitable era in the stock market.   MT made no effort to locate me or notify me, said they did not have my address or phone and that it was not their responsibility to notify me.  Even after I gave them all my information, they never made contact.  MT made no effort to advise me, or better steward my money.   HORRIBLE financial institution with no regard for responsibly handling my money.  Also it has been difficult transferring my money to another institution.",5

I was given a promise yesterday that on my 2nd account I was not going to be charged the $25 account closing fee. I was told it would be waived and I thanked her for this. Well, obviously someone didn't receive the memo because I was charged for termination of 2nd account.  You can review the promise made due to our sessions have been recorded.  If you're interested in honoring the promise and make good on our deal I will then reevaluate my position and my review will reflect this and I will restore the number of stars. If not, then this will remain my honest and true review. The decision is yours. Please honor the promise made by your company representative and waive the fee as originally promised.

Performance of Millennium Trust,"The service on withdrawal of my 401K rollover with Millennium Trust was great. The only problem I encountered with was a rep who took my initial call. She was working from home, because I heard a baby crying in the background. She was very nasty with me on the call & I had to tell her she has no way of speaking to me that way. I need help withdrawing my entire money from the company (old accounts). I asked for her help & she had an attitude. I had to tell her if I knew what I was doing I wouldn’t be seeking her help. If this going to be your attitude, customer service is not for you. I am a senior citizen & this is how I was treated by the rep. I wanted to speak with her supervisor instead, but she finally cooperated. Getting my fund was fast through direct deposit.",5

👍🏼,"MT is High Level ""Legal"" Scam!!!This is a High Level ""Legal"" Scam in which employers sell 401Ks to ""trust"" companies like Millennium Trust and then this unscrupulous corporation charges ""annual maintenance fees"" on these accounts until they're empty while employees do not know and/or forget about these accounts and loose their rightful retirement money. Also, if you attempt to transfer this money to a different and more respectable 401k company, they will make sure to pretend they never received the paperwork from that other company. Unbelievable.

It was very easy to use the website and…,"My previous employer moved my 401K to Millennium Trust without my knowledge because my amount was below their threshold.  Although I did not agree with this I also ignored the letters and emails they sent to me because I didn't want to do anything with my 401K.  That was my fault not Millennium Trusts.  Once it was transferred I was upset and also thought the maintenance fees were quite high, however I found Millennium Trust is very straight forward with their fees and processes.  I followed their directions and logged in successfully no problem to my account.  I also read all the negative reviews about Millennium Trust and thought it would be a nightmare to get my money transferred or withdraw and waited a year to try.  I have to say, it was very easy and straight forward again to move and close my account.  I don't know what the big fuss was with the negative reviews.  Just following their directions I had my money transferred in a few days to my bank account.  I was pleasantly surprised.  If you don't like that your money was moved to them just follow the directions and move it where you want, don't bash Millennium Trust.  I gave them 4 stars because of what I thought were high fees.  In one year I was charged $80 for opening, yearly maintenance and closing.",5

You stated that you refunded the fees to the account, but that makes no sense since I closed the account and am waiting for you to send me a check to send to my current 401k provider.  If you did refund the $60 to the account, that means a new account will be opened and you'll charge me $60 to get the money out of it.  Of course, then I went to your site today and it says my account is still open, the fees weren't refunded, and another $25 fee was charged!  So now I don't even know what's going on over there.

Transaction time was 2 days.,"Had my 401k transferred to them by my company and I only got one letter from them telling me they have my money. 3 years later, they keep charging me fees until I decided to take it all out, and SURPRISE! Instead of getting back what I deposited plus interest for using my money, I get back less because I kept getting charged.UPDATE Oct 8:I called and asked about my charges with CAMILLE and she said I will be getting a refund within the next few days since I wasn't notified about them. It's been more than a week and nothing. Their system is very sketchy!UPDATE NOV 4: Still no refund but I noticed they updated their replay on my review to make it look like the have taken care of everything when in fact they didn't even call me yesterday to check if I ever got my fees back. HUGE RED FLAG!Update Nov 10: I have finally received a check with the amount I was taxed without notification. The company seemes to be legit and obeys US laws but I would definitely not recommend them to friends or use them again because keeping track of your money and managing it is very difficult in an era where everyone else puts these facilities at your fingertips on an app",4

My first and only experience with…,"My entire 401K balance was moved from Fidelity to Millennium Trust without notice or my permission. No phone call, no email, no letter. Nothing.It was entirely up to ME to notice that suddenly my account had a balance of $0 (good thing I check frequently) and then try to put together the mystery as to WHERE DID MY MONEY GO?Why do I even need to ASK such a question?Imagine how you would have reacted in this situation.With persistence, I was able to track down my money. Had several phone calls with unhelpful people, and then I had to wait several weeks just to be able to access my money again. Again, cannot over-emphasize this part: MY MONEY.I say this because they treated the situation like the funds in question were theirs, or belonged to some other entity, or some fund manager, or just a few numbers on a computer screen printout. They really do not have the notion that what we're talking about is 100% MINE.I moved everything out of Millennium Trust into a new account where I feel it is now finally safe again. Whew!Truly unbelievable.Quick followup. Some unknown person from Millennium Trust responded to this post to give readers the impression that they took quick action. But don't be fooled. They said they would call, but never did.Followup #2.  Someone from Millennium posted back on this thread again and invited me to give them one more chance, and asked that I call them. I did, and the only thing that happed was they put me on endless hold. So bad. Really.",5

The website/link to set up username and login( that was emailed to me) would not accept any of the login names I tried, I tried like 8 different ones, no where did it say the requirements of the username, I guess that you had to use an email as a login. I had to call back in and wait on hold again to find that out. I guess we are going to be charged $85 just to get our money/ retirement out of the program.

I needed to get my IRA transferred,We triedI tried to get information about an IRA that I have with M trust company.I could not log on to my account It told me my info was invalid.Even after a rep was helping me and gave me a new password it would not work.The only reason I am giving you a rating of 4 and not 1 is because the rep that worked with me would not give up. and kept trying to make it work.

When I tried to create an account and log in, I got as far as the place where they were supposed to send me a 6 digit confirmation that never arrived. I called them, was put on hold for 13 minutes and cut off. I called again, and while I was waiting I tried again and got the confirmation code. This took me to a screen where I could select one of two accounts. I arbitrarily chose the Roth and completed the login. But when I tried to locate my Traditional IRA I couldn't find it anywhere. I found no place to search for the account # (I had photographed the screen that showed both). I was able to request liquidation of the Roth, but still couldn’t find the Traditional. I posted a request for help on the portal which went unanswered, but after I posted this review with 2 stars I quickly received a phone call and email offering help. A VERY helpful representative walked me through a process to link my second account, and apologetically admitted that their system does not allow for setting up a portal with multiple accounts without contacting their Tech Support. SO: All’s we’ll that ends well, but only 4 stars for a system that cannot set up multiple accounts without tech support. And the schedule of fees to do every little thing still seems excessive to me.",3

Fast and simple process for withdrawal,"No ACH transfers is highly suspicious when they take 401ks from tech companies. Thier record keeping practice is also highly suspicious.""The funds in your ira have been placed in an investment chosen by their former employer to preserve principal and provide reasonable rate of return..."" That's a lie, as they didn't do this, they kept it in cash and even tried to charge me fees instead of paying me intrest or investing it as this quote promised. At least I argued out of the fees. ""Automatically rolled over into an account at Mellennium Trust"" which is against the 401k policy of my previous employer. Didn't stop Mellennium from opting to custodian the tendies.  I never opened an account with these people...it seems like collusion with Cognizant in my 401k ""management."" Trust me you can't single handily fight collusion between 2 cooperations though...The only thing I agree with is ""Take control of your account"" as they say cause these people are ""above and beyond custody."" Thier words not mine. Sus.I wouldn't trust these guys as custodians of a gym locker room let alone to custodian any real amount of money.",5

When I checked the account it had gone from over $700 down to under $500 solely because of fees from MT. The money was in a cash account, no service was ever rendered. The money was just sitting in an account no different than a savings account. I pulled the remainder out of the account because I find this to be unscrupulous and would never recommend your company.MT, thanks for the reply that the account was closed and monies sent are coming. I know this as I completed everything on line the day before and got a confirmation. Again doing nothing but charging another $25 to close the account. Again, theft. Payment for nothing.

So helpful and respectful,I gave MTrust 3 stars because my experience with them was both good and bad. Trying to make contact with the bank after receiving a letter was excruciating. I followed the letter's directions and registered online but couldn't proceed any further than the sign in. Called customer service and got the run around but was assured that I'd get an email in a few days verifying my registration. Never happened. Received another letter 4 months later and again contacted customer service. Hit the jackpot this time. The customer rep tried to get me verified online but experienced the same error I had previously received.  However this rep also told me the balance of my account and emailed me a link for the distribution form. Filled it out and submitted the form and received an email acknowledging their receipt of the form. Amazingly I had the money in my bank within 5 days!!!!! Wish I knew the rep's name so I could mention it in this review.,5

To top it all off I was told that I had to pay in order to receive information through the mail, Horrible. This all seems like a scam if she doesn’t know, we won’t tell and maybe she will forget.  I will be removing my money ASAP.",5

Fast and easy process that takes you…,"Dear Sir/Madam,My previous employer transferred my 401k money to ""Millennium Trust"" after I left the company. When we saw the statement we got the very first thing we noticed was that we were already changed $30 for the ""Establishment Fee"" and $45 for the ""Annual Asset Holding Fee"" Out of a total balance of a little over $500. I asked my previous employer to transfer the rest of the money to my different 401K account by filling out the form they requested but they never took action on it. I forgot to follow up and when I created an online account recently, I noticed another charge of $45 for ""Annual Account Fee"" and $12 for ""Paper Statement Fee"". I decided to call customer service and luckily the representative I talked to genuinely cared about my situation and reversed a few of the charges from my account. I gave 4 stars just because of his professionalism and kind gesture. But, overall I'm in awe of how this company is getting away by charging an insane amount of money as fees.",5

Thank you for all your help!,"It felt kind of shady how my account was handled.  I left my company which automatically rolled over my 401k to Millennium.   Millennium had my account for over a year and never reached out to me about my account (not an email or letter in the mail about my account).  I had to call and try to figure out my account number, how to see my balance, and verify that they had my account, etc.  I expected, at a minimum quarterly, account balance updates via email or mail.",5
well done,"I had to switch accounts since my money got moved over without telling me from my old work, plus it took forever and way too many steps to go through to switch. At some point on the phone they told me they sent an email for moving forward… yeah no never received any email, text, mail, nothing. I hope this gets improved so on one will have to go though what I had to. Probably worst place to ever go to. Thumbs down for this system",5

Awesome,"I found the website to be very cumbersome and confusing.  I don't normally have to call for help to navigate a website but this time I did.  The verification process did not allow me to copy/paste the verification code into the website and it took me several tries before I realized that I had to enter the code manually.  It would have saved time and frustration if this was self explanatory.  My purpose today was to update some information and I was rather surprised that the asked me to verify personal information that I I had not previously given it.  They were valid questions that I could answer, but were the types of questions that would arise during an intensive credit check.",5

Awesome company,Great company very 🙂 ce and made me money,5
Great customer service and very…,"Overall my experience has been not bad, but not great. I have a self directed Roth IRA here and another Roth IRA somewhere else. It's so hard to get money into this account. Why can't I just do an ACH transfer on their website like I can with my other Roth IRA, instead of having to fill out forms, sign them, scan them, email them, hope they don't think it's an e-signature and have to call them, then wait until the money transfers? I would put in so much more money if it wasn't so hard to move it into the account.Honestly, that's my only complaint, but I have to use them because it's the only company the marketplace lending company uses. Still, I've had good experiences when I call in.The fees are not unreasonable, in my opinion, for what it is (self directed Roth IRA). Like I said, overall good, but not great.",5

The customer service was very helpful both times I had called and is the main reason for my glowing review. I wish I'd had the courage and sense to call earlier once I'd gotten everything set up with my current employer. I might have saved more of it from annual fees had I done so.,5
Mostly pretty easy,Thanks for everything.,4
Excellent service,Helped me navigate there website ....very nice customer service.,5
Voice-automated system is terrible,"I never had a problem with anything until it came to withdraw the money from my account. It wasn't even necessarily a problem. It was easily and quickly available. It just wasn't entirely clear to me what would happen with the 10% tax I chose to withhold... Does it mean my account stays open with that 10% as a balance, or does it get sent to the IRS to pay the tax? I was very confused with this, but it may just be my inexperience with such circumstances. I tried logging in after the withdrawal and saw that there was still that 10% balance, so I just wasn't sure what was going on or if it's still considered an active account. If someone could contact me with information on this, it would be greatly appreciated! Everything else was easy to maintain and access, so a very great experience overall! I especially liked that they notified me with any changes going on with my account.",3

It sometimes was hard to change…,"Well, because I was told by a representative from the bank who originally held my 401k, “I would be issued a check on July 6th 2021, if I did not roll it over or keep it with them”. That was a lie. Instead, for some strange reason, they sent my money to you. Why does a bank send money that doesn’t belong to them, to a different bank???? Now I had to go through the B.S. of proving who I was and producing documentation, yada yada yada. Then I have to pay you $25.00 to give me my money that you’ve only had for about 30 days?!!? And I still don’t know why the hell they sent it to you....but thats bulchit too! They should’ve sent it to me. W T F? Are u people gonna send my money to a bank who I’ll have to pay money to in order to get it back? I’m trying to understand how legal this is...or isn’t. After the tax hit and banks like yours it’s a wonder I get any of it back. I guess I’ll have to do more research to understand the stupidity of a bank sending someone’s money to another bank, without their knowledge or permission, instead of just sending it back to them.",3

Just overall great,So over this company. Calling in to speak to someone is useless; it’s been months and I still haven’t been able to move over my money to my new account. It’s not like I chose to work with this company; I got stuck with them. And it’s been nothing but a hassle.

Still, there was no indication of when the transfer would occur nor a confirmation of success. And NO ACCOUNTING! Why is the amount so low? Was there withholding? What were the final fees? I was considering keeping my funds with you when I changed employers and even transferring more but the fees are just ridiculous. I am keeping my money with someone who wants my business.

super easy to work with,Very confusing. They make it extremely difficult for people to get their own money. I don’t even know how to get my other account closed so there goes that money. I think they do that on purpose so people lose out on their own funds. I don’t even know if I even properly closed my Roth account… how unfair is that? Why can’t they just make things easy on people and let them talk to a human being and cut them a check to be mailed to their address??? People are going through enough as it is these days aren’t we???,5

The online site was easy to understand…,"Money was rolled over from a former employer's 401K plan to this company. This was done without notice in April. This is August and I learned of the transfer after receiving a quarterly statement a few days ago from Vanguard which showed a ZERO balance and all funds were withdrawn. Millennium Trust is the new ""custodian"" of my account. They have had my money since APRIL. In order to access my money, I had to create an account with them and prove my identity by providing the kind of information that hackers love to get their hands on. The account set-up process was a real drag and only gave me access to part, not all of my funds. I then had to contact Millennium Trust customer service to find out where the rest of my money was. Then I had to go through the same excruciating process for a second time. There were numerous problems on their site and I had to repeat the process FOUR times before my request went through. They charge outrageous fees for being a ""custodian"" of MY money and also charge to close out accounts. It's really a bad deal. If you leave an employer, roll that 401K over immediately. Do NOT let Millennium Trust get hold of your money. They will erode whatever you have saved by charging fees. This is downright predatory. My money should be MY money. Millennium Trust should have notified me that they had my money and they should have proactively sent me the information I needed to access my funds.",5

Although very new to Millennium,"Ridiculous fees. I can't believe my former employer used this company. $125 deducted for ""admin fees"" then on confirming the account, they take another $35 + 25 and then to get your money out, it's a $25 cancellation fee. Talk about a racket that the employee doesn't even get a say in! Terrible, just terrible.",5

I wasn’t expecting this at all, since it never happens any more - changing my review to 5 stars as problems happen, but making it right is all I’ll ever ask for.They locked me out of trading on my account and no one could figure out why. They told me it would be fixed in 15 minutes and after 2 hours it still wasn’t fixed so I called back in and they can’t figure it out. Frustrating to say the least, I hope that it gets resolved and in the meantime I put my trade in with the trade desk and now hope that it went through. Fingers crossed.",5

It was pretty easy to use,Does not allow for a distribution from a 401k account to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA. Only allows a distribution to a current employer 401k or paid out in full (leaving you paying tons of taxes and penalties). They also charge you $25 a month for having an account and they charge you $25 to close your account. My former employer switched over to Millennium Trust without me knowing and I would not recommend.,4

Pretty good,"Wow.  Where to start.  I'll start by saying they have always answered the phones promptly and seemed courteous and helpful.  But, in the end, it has ALWAYS been a process of running around in circles and making it impossible to get my funds out.  I inherited money from my sister 2-1/2 years ago.  She had a security in a Millenium Trust (MT) account.  We had to go through a difficult process (medallion signature) at the bank, just to get portions of the MT account into each of the beneficiaries names.  The bank said the MT medallion process was ""odd"", but they did it.  Fast forward 30 months, and the monies in the securities still have not been able to be disbursed to the beneficiaries.  We've tried working with MT and with the security, getting varying ""requirements"" that we still have to do.  But no matter what we've tried, no funds have been released.  My portion of the account has reduced from almost $4K to under $2K in that time, and MT has asked for payment for ""account management"" from each of the beneficiaries.  Bear in mind here that NONE of us wanted an account with Millenium.  All we ever wanted was to get my sister's money to the beneficiaries.  We were REQUIRED to get a Millenium account and having them make each of us pay for an account that should have been disseminated long ago is adding insult to injury.  I'm not sure if this is intentional, but it sure seems like it.I warn everyone here...pay heed to the many one-star ratings.  We've lived it and are amazed a company like Millenium hasn't has multiple lawsuits filed against them. (Maybe they have)!  I feel sorry for those who have their work IRAs, etc. invested with Millenium.  I hope they all can eventually get their money back out of their account.",3
Easy to do,Very helpful agent. Very efficient transaction,5
Attendant was very helpful!,Excellent telephone service from Jesse and very fast response time online.  Quite pleased.,5

She explained everything I needed to do in detail and even send me the instructions via email, while on the phone. I wanted to transfer my money out, but now I am reconsidering it. It feels like my investment is in good hands with MIllenium Trust.",5
Every time I log in,"You guys were very helpful,  thank you",5
Just Excellent,"This was a miserable experience.  My company was the beneficiary of a will and the deceased entrusted her estate to Millennial Trust. The executor of the will hassled with Millennial for nearly two years before funds were partially dispersed.  Millennial was unresponsive, gave conflicting information, causing delay after delay (we couldn't get a straight answer form anyone, after dozens of phone calls), and it dragged on and on.  No one at Millennial was able to answer our questions, instead referring us from one department and person to the next.  I was forced to open an IRA account for my company (which I didn't want and according to my accountant, my Sub chapter-S company was not permitted to open to begin with) in order for funds to be distributed into it.  After MONTHS, the funds were partially there.  And then, after a demand letter from me that they be fully distributed--a letter sent by certified mail--the funds  had dwindled down to nearly nothing! Now the balance has dropped by thousands of dollars, and I'm told that I own money for ""account maintenance.""  Here's the exact wording:  ""Please be advised the your Account fees are now severely past due.  Please be advised that your payment in the amount of $131.46 is due within 10 days of the daye of this notice.  Failure to make payment may result in our resignation on your account.""I sent a certified mail letter to Millennial on February 26, 2021 requesting that the account be closed and that the funds (several thousand dollars at that point) be disbursed to my company (Logos Educational Corporation). I heard nothing from anyone, and now on July 15, 2021, I'm told that the account balance has dropped below $0.00, and that my company owes Millennial $131.46 in fees.Having no response for Millennial cost me thousands of dollars.  I would never, never recommend this company for any financial interactions:  they are non responsive, clumsy (no one knows what the right hand is doing while the let hand is moving) and they have miserable customer service.Avoid Millennial Trust like the plague.  They are a miserable, incompetent company.  Trust me on this.  All those involved in the estate distribution feel the same way.  All in all, it was a horrible, frustrating experience.  The company should be forced out of business for gross incompetency.",5

It took me more than 2 weeks to gain access to my IRA accounts. arp@mtrustcompany - the ARP department, which is responsible for communicating with clients or customers, provides the slowest response in customer service in human history. You sent an email, you get an automatic response, and then you get a human response -- everything seems fine except that if you replied their human response, not only will you not get a follow-up email, but also if the process where something is missing or error, you will not be notified. You will have to write another new email and asked about it, and then they will tell you 1 issue. If your situation has more than 1 issues, you'll have to do this multiple times until all the issues are resolved -- and this is still on you even if you already told them your situation and everything that they needed to know, as well as everything that you should know.Phone support is a hit-or-miss.

I would recommend this company to everyone,Customer representative who helped me to resolve my issue was very knowledgeable and very patiently helped me out fully.  Happy with overall experience.,5
Surprisingly easy to disburse my IRA,"My prior employer rolled my retirement into an IRA at Millennium Trust, so I followed instructions to create a new user name & PW.  Then MT confirmed my new user account and gave me a link to access my information.  I went to the login page just fine, entered my new user name & PW, but THE LOGIN PAGE WAS DEAD.  NOTHING HAPPENED.  No errors or warnings or spinning wheel of 'please wait.'  Very frustrating.",5
The staff on call were very…,"I did not know what to do after my funds were released from my Teachers retirement account and placed in the Millennium Trust account. I explained to the gentleman with MT that I need my funds to go to Fundrise, and he sent me forms to fill out that I did not completely understand. Fortunately there was a statement in the email that was sent that I could go directly to the Fundrise account I had established for the rollover to direct my investment to that account. All I had to do was click on a button on Fundrise's web site to redirect the money from MT to Fundrise and no one told me this is what I needed to do!",5
The representative was helpful and…,"The representative was knowledgeable, and quick to answer my questions, even my follow up call back was quick and easy!",5
The person I work with was…Nice,"very easy to do transaction, laid out very nicely",5
Quickly verified necessary info for…,M Trust is very difficult to navigate.  I'm trying to transfer my small balance to my other IRA and it's proving to be ridiculously difficult.  My financial advisor for my IRA account can't even figure out what to do. And the fact that you can't do an electric funds transfer is also a sign that I need to get my funds to a more reliable financial institution.,5

Rating of Millennium,Good company who clients can trust and depend on.,5

Logging in and getting codes doesn't work half the time because your code arrives AFTER the log in times out putting the consumer into a loop of not being able to log in.Edit to respond: the guy on the phone was okay, but it was a lot of roundabout to get there considering your automatic answer explicitly tells us to use the portal. Everything will be satisfactory once my funds make it to the new group.",5

They also seem to intentionally place many roadblocks in their customer service to discourage you from following up on transferring your money. My 401K was very small as it was only a couple of months old when I changed jobs. Even so it is my money. It’s taken me several months to get access to my money, After it was transferred to them without my permission. (That’s another story). Incidentally my money performed very poorly with millennium compared to where I had it and where I was wanting it transferred. On a couple of thousand dollar balance it cost me a few hundred dollars.",5

Good customer service,Very helpful and easy to use once explained by the representative who was extremely professional.,5
Thanks,"The representatives don't care and give out the wrong information. I spoke to someone named Kenyatta, who was very aloof on the phone, and not very attentive. There was a weird pause before answering any questions, so long and inappropriate that I would say hello thinking we were disconnected. Her tone indicated she couldn't care less. When I asked her if everything was ok and if she could hear me there was an even longer delay. When I asked her direct questions about disbursement times and options and told me  up to 7 days to receive a paper check. I found out after waiting 7 days that that was not true. Their process for processing paper checks is 17 days. SMH. I am in such a tight spot financially and in a position of need very time sensitive. Her dissemination if incorrect information has effected me greatly. The time I have waited has has caused me to be in a position of lack now. She was not the only one who gave me incorrect information. The representative I spoke with after the fact also reiterated the same time frame for a check disbursement. It wasn't until I spoke with someone named Chandra that I was told the wait time is 17 days just for processing forget delivery. All of this confusion could have been avoided had I been given viable, correct information from the representative. This has been a terrible experience.",5
The last 2 conversations with your rep,Not easy to work with in doing anything. I called and wanted to take care of a transfer over the phone which I have been able to do at other institutions with my 401k  very easily and millennium trust would not do anything over the phone. I had to fill out way more paperwork than was necessary to make a simple transfer and it was a big waste of time dealing with any customer service representative.,5

Took forever just to figure out how to talk with someone and then when I actually did get to talk to a person they refused to help me instead sending me to a website that I had already been on and didn't help me the first time.  After calling back 3 times finally got a person to give me a number to fax something to them, not knowing if anyone will actually ever get the fax.  All for an account that has $1100 in it.

Very great customer service.,Easy to use and helpful,5
Not put on hold - spoke with a helpful representative right away,Great service. Thanks.,5
It is very easy to use the site,There is no one to really help you. The reps do not know answers to questions. It took over two months to get them to transfer my IRA to another firm who actually answer your questions and help you make any financial decisions or investments.,5
Easy to use portal,Out of many companies have worked with previously this company has steep fees. They do not make it easy at all to rollover the funds to your existing IRA. My advise to you is if you are leaving a company do not quickly roll over your account as there may be funds that are still not there in your 401k account like in my case which I didn't know till nearly 6 months later when the company I worked sent my funds to this crap company. If someone leaves the money in this account it could quickly be gone with their fee structure. Perhaps that is the reason behind the long process that they have in place so that they can maybe collect even more fees from people. Fees to have account. Fees to close the account and roll the money to any other fund and more fees on top of that.,5
I had a pleasant experience,"Requested IRA rollover, process was pain free and very fast!!! Great company!!",4
Great online experience and personal customer support 5-Stars!!,"I called three times, twice in one day and then another day.  The first customer service representative was friendly but did not explain about setting up my account.

The customer service team was great and…,Helped answer all of my questions,3
Review,The overall experience could only have been worse if they lost my money. Every step one takes to access your assets in order to transfer it to an approved firm is made so tedious to complete online or over the phone that you almost want to just give up. This is by design. It is nothing short of pathetic. In order to assure that my request to transfer was done properly I was told that it was actually directed to mail the officially approved signed transfer documents rather than email. I could be more dissatisfied with their overall service and account access elements.,5
Refund,The process was clear and painless. Appreciated,5
I needed to close and move my 401k…,"The individual who assisted me was professional, polite, and knowledgeable.",5
Easy process…site is very user friendly,Everything was perfectly done at my request great service was provided to me on time,5
This Company wow me,"It was easy to cash out my funds. I did not want to do that at all. The process of transfering my funds was not made to be a simple task. I asked direct questions and did not recieve direct answers. I was told that the process would be simple to transfer my funds fom my account into my new 401k but there was so much paperwork involved and would have taken a time estamate for about a month to complete. I am dissapointed in the service I recieved in that department. No one was willing to help me understand the process clearly. I am a kind and patient woman. It takes alot to frustrate me. Finance is not the problem it was the customer service involoved. It was very disheartening when the several men who answered the phones were ""put out"" by my questions and was trying to rush me off of the phone. Honestly I am glad I no longer invest with this company. Not only was I charged a fee for investing with this company for seveal years. i do believe 30$ of my money was taken away from my account twice a year without notice. Not only that, I was disrespected from the people with whom I entrusted my hard earned money with. Good Bye and Good Ridance. I hope you crash during the upcoming stock market downfall. Like I said; It really takes alot to upset me. Crooks like you do not deserve to operate.",5

Had to get my som a car:(,"Confusing website, poor customer service agents, and no documentation of the distribution, fees & taxes taken I went from $890.24 with Fidelity Trust to a distribution payout of 747.24 with Millennium Trust.  Documentation sent to me for the paper application for a distribution was dated 6/16/21 but the postmark on the envelope was 6/7/21.  I know I mailed the documents for the distribution payout on 6/15/21 but was told that wasn't possible.  Finally I decided to fill out the online application form for distribution which was a tremendous amount of work and got a direct deposit to my bank account three days later.NEVER AGAIN!Linda Aloisio",5

Super easy and convenient,"Millennium Trust is just a scam. Collecting all your personal information (likely to sell) and then charging you money to get the money that your former employer failed to cash out when you left the company. I asked my former employer to cash out all of my retirement because I didn't know when I was going to roll it over into new investments. Instead, they left over $100, which then had a $35 annual fee and a $10 account closure feed deducted from just to receive it. What a complete scam this company is.",5

Helpful customer service,"My previous employer Ascension Health mailed me a notification 2 months ago that if my account was under $5k and I didn't act, my account balance would be transferred from Transamerica to Millennium Trust Company. My total balance at Transamerica was well over $5k but I did not realize that my Employer Match account was separate, under $5k and therefore subject to this seizure. I saw it disappeared from my account one day and then i received a Withdrawal Notification in the mail that Millennial had my funds. No phone number anywhere, not in any mailing. No information about what had happened. I called Transamerica thinking I had been hacked and my money stolen. Transamerica gave me the phone number to Millennium. Long story short, it will cost me $60 and about 6 weeks - if I stay on top of them - to get my money out. Millennium ""invests"" your money in a cash sweep account which then charges you fees which may be over and above the interest you earn. Other investments will cost you additional fees to get both into and out of them. Beginning in April 22, the .20% of expenses may well exceed the .03% current interest and then a NEGATIVE INTEREST rate will begin eating away your funds. In addition, they will charge you $35/year for the privilege of ripping you off. It looks to me like a carefully disguised shell game but Its really more of a long term heist: fees here, there and everywhere. I think my previous employer made money off this deal as well. Act quickly to move your money out. Take the $60 hit in the beginning and get it out quickly. Do a Direct Rollover, don't invest in anything and don't request a wire. This will keep your fees down. Once they take their initial fees to just establish and immediately close your account, the next fee won't be until January although you may be losing monthly, depending on whether the monthly fees exceed the interest rate earned.  No company that has to compete for your money would charge $35 yearly to hold an IRA account invested in funds that returns a Negative rate. They can get away with this only because  people naively assume their previous employer takes care of its ex-employees and they don't pay attention. WAKE UP! Act",5

Then I had to provide the same information to the rep that I provided to their answering system. I decided to close the acct & then had to go online & complete several pages to do this. I will admit the rep I talked to was polite & stuck with me while I completed the multiple pages of forms. I am thankful for that.

Jennifer was so helpful and friendly!,Your agents do not respond to emails that they ask you to send documentation to. They do not respond to follow up emails and when I called I had a very rude agent that told me my documentation would not work. So I have been waiting over a week for a response to be told something and it’s unacceptable that I had to call to find out information they should have told me in the first place so that I could get the correct documentation. So once again I have sent in new documentation and have I heard anything back? No!! You handle people’s money and have the WORST customer experience! I’m fully withdrawing my funds and going elsewhere. This is ridiculous.,5
Yuriana was very helpful and patient…,"The registration process is outrageously difficult. For example, the requirement for characters for a password do not automatically appear when choosing a password. Then, if you don't use the correct characters, there's no message to say so. You just find out you did something wrong. Once you complete the form correctly, you can't get into your document until the next day. That's ridiculous. Each time you log in, you need a user name, password, security question answer, and a security code. That's more than all the other financial institutions I deal with. This is enough of a pain in the neck that I have already looked into rolling my money over to someone else.",5

The agent I spoke with was very clear…,"Of the many similar firms I have dealt with, none are slower or more difficult to work with.  Waiting for days to get simple access to my account is normal for Millennium Trust, although not for the multitude of other choices, and for this bottom-rung of service, they charge fees that other firms do not.For worst-in-class service, they should at least be lowest-cost-in class.Alas, I will be closing my account as soon as they can get my money transferred.*Edit: I got the message.

After we sorted that out, I did get the information was seeking but will probably call back to see if I can get someone else to confirm.   Confidence is low. I gave three stars, which is average, but know that average is fairly poor across the board.   Service levels have declined and expecting bad service is now the average. It helps to have lowered expectations so you don't get angry or frustrated.",5
Good service,I called because I locked myself out when trying to log onto their website. The representative was very kind and helpful making sure to go through all of the security questions to confirm my identity. Once confirmed she worked very quickly to reset my password and gave a temp password to get me signed into the site.

I had a smooth process with them,"To Whom It May Concern,The only problem that I experienced was during the final steps of my request for the total amount. I was required to download the information, which messed up the computer. Why not be able to finish the procedures, then download the final steps? I repeated the steps 3-4 times before it finally worked correctly--it was a big hassle for those of us who have a basic understanding of technology/ computers, but are not experts. I received my check in the mail on the 22nd. Thank you for your kind and prompt attention to my request. It was the final step in the process that was the problem.Best Regards,Carl Long",5

It was difficult to work with them to transfer the small number of funds (less than $2,000) to my current retirement plan.  What was worse was the $20.00 per year ""handling fee"" and the $10.00 paper statement fee.  I'm assuming the statement must have been hand printed on gold bonded resume paper by a team of scribes. If I left the account alone with Millennium Trust, it would have been empty long before I ever came close to retiring.",5

That's great,"- Millennium nickel and dimes with fees that should be disclosed BEFORE ANY funds are transferred to Millennium—which ISN'T EVEN A BANK.- The portal doesn’t allow rollovers to other banks which necessitated an archaic phone call only to be told it would require a manual process. On top of that, there’s a charge to get my money out and close the account.- A rude and indignant CSR put me on hold only to disconnect me and I had to go through the whole authentication AGAIN. The phone call was almost 35 minutes and did not achieve anything hat couldn’t have been done on the portal if it was actually functional.",5

But my online access is now set up and we'll see if I can easily transfer funds from my 401k to my IRA. Wish my luck.",5
Knowledgable Team,I called to clarify things and was told miss informed information about the form I had emailed. I then was repeatedly rudely talked to in a tone as if I had done so many terrible things. I'm not impressed with any of the services from your company or the transfer from my previous company which I have repeatedly emailed and mailed you and the other company about to transfer my funds properly in the first place back in March of 2021. It is not acceptable to treat people that you are providing a service to in this way.,5
Great service,"I called the line to find out more about creating an account to cash out my balance and the agent I spoke with sounded irritated because I asked him to please stay with my while I was filling out my info.

She said that would be handled by another department. Also, as the phone call progressed there  seemed to be no problem with the fax. The left me somewhat bewildered as to why the problem with the fax was even mentioned, if there would be no way for me to solve the so-called problem(s). Also, the 15 day turnaround time for a direct rollover seems somewhat excessive in the computer age.",5

I just think a phone call from you to my banking institution could verify that the account was issued in my full name ( ID is required for  opening an account)  even if my middle name was on the check. I should not have had to go and get a letter from the bank. I was told that this bank doesn’t know me, I doubt that they know me at my bank (just another name). I’m really annoyed because I needed the money sooner than having it come by mail.  if I’m missing something here, I apologize for the misunderstanding and thanks for safeguarding my account.",5
Millennium Trust portal was very easy…,This company did everything it could to hold on to my retirement funds. For some reason they think this is their money. This company is a fraud!!!! They will take your retirement funds and never give it back! Lame!,5
Very easy to use site,"Poor customer service and the software portal had little to no functionality.  I retired and ended with a few thousand dollars somehow getting deposited to Millennium that will take 6-7 weeks to get transferred and consolidated.  I could not get a statement on line, get my account number or do a simple transfer to my consolidated account at Morgan Stanley.   Representatives on the phone did not really care to assist.  After 3 weeks of phone calls, emails and trying to use the unfunctional software it appears this may be in process but will take another month.   My broker with a statement should have been able to do this in a few minutes electronically.",5
Very impressed with your staff and…,Need a written signature to transfer an account? Wake up to the 21st century and start accepting electronic signatures!,5

Name wasn't spelled correctly,"Erykah assisted me with getting my IRA Distributation situated. She was very professional, polite and knowledgeable of her work. Judy, her supervisor, also assisted in getting my online application completed.

The entire process was easy simple and…,I still haven’t received my cash out money.Really how long does it take for me to get my money.It should have never went to you in the first place.Just received a call about my money.It’s been 2 weeks. They said that it is still in process.I can’t believe it takes a large company this long to process a payment.It will be over 3 weeks for me to receive my money.Just because the would not wire it into my account Not good business Would never use this company,5
Great service,The process to distribute my money to my bank was fast and easy. The money was in my bank just a couple of days. Thank you!,5
I am very satisfied with Millennium,I think it may be a good company to work with.It took quite a few months to get through the information to understand how  the IRA worked from Kohl's.The fee chart was easy to understand. Just needed the money and it had not made any interest since it was turned over from Kohls as an active employee.,5
all good,I would have gone 5 stars if it had been easier to to upload the pictures of my check and if I had received an email to show that my request was being processed.,5
I was very pleased with the ease of…,Dav was very helpful with all my questions,5

Great company to work with,My questions were answered attentively and throughly.,5
Not finished yet,thank you for the very quick and easy process,4
Easy to use,"I have been trying for months to try to get a traditional IRA rolled over to another company.  TransAmerica assigned my funds to Millennium, without my knowledge, months ago.  I have contacted Millennium 7 times to get updates.  First, they tell me they need something from the company I'm rolling over to.  Fine.  I repeatedly ask them, ""Is there anything else you need?""  Response, no, that is all we need.  I follow up with Millenium and they say, ""Oh, we need this first.""  I provide it and, again, ask, ""Is there anything else you need to get this moving?""  Response, no, that is all we need.  This has gone on with each call . . . they need something to initiate the process.  Here we are now months later and I learn it takes 90 days for a custodial company (Millennium) to begin the process AFTER they have received everything.  Keep in mind, they have told me they had everything 6 times!  Frankly, Millennium sucks.  Had I had a choice, I would NEVER have allowed them to be the custodial for my funds.",5
Millennium Trust has been wonderful,"Representative was very helpful and fully explained processes, procedures and timelines",5
Very courteous and knowledgable,"The staff very unprofessional,and very difficult to work. I gave one ⭐ start because do not allowed me to gave 0.",5
Simple and quick,Was surprised that Millennium isn’t set-up for wire transfers having to  wait weeks for a simple transfer of funds to another wire house but no choice did not pick millennium my last employer did I assume was the “economical” choice? Nothing against him personally but in today’s age of wanting things faster they need to get on the wire transfers.,5
Great customer service!!,Was very annoying that I could not close my account over the phone I was forced to go obline after being on the phone for 30 mins with someone.  I then had to go online and close my account and give the same information to get this disspersment done. The person I talked with said legally they couldnt do it over the phone I would like to see what legal precident prevents closing an account over the phone seeing as I have done this previously with other companies in the past.,5

I had a hard time getting through all the forms but she was awesome about walking through it with me. On a scale of 1 to 10, I rate her at least a 15. She was phenomenal. Thank you for staffing with personal of her caliber and a very, very special word of gratitude to Jackie.",5

I waited 25 min and when I didn’t receive the form in my email I called again. Spoke w Erica this time. She informed me it would be sent within 24 - 72 business hours, I wasn’t told this on the first call. She then put in a request for a form by this afternoon. But she helped me locate the form on line and I was able to download it. Yes I waited to the last minute to file because I owe $$ on taxes. But thanks to Erica for all her help. Good job.",5

Easy to work with,The lady I spoke to was very helpful and pleasant,5
Statement Help,"I spoke to  supervisor named Michelle. She was rude and decided to dictate to me (who had funds transferred unknowingly and I didn't understand the process) how I was supposed to understand everything. However, everything she dictated to me was not on the site the way she ""TOLD ME"" I was looking at it. This was a horrible experience. If you read this please consider it a zero call against the agent and supervisor. Thanks.Why would I ever want you to reach out to me again after being spoken too that way? I'll reach out and work to get my funds moved to a respectful institution. My money was moved without me knowing. I expressed this on the call. I was then spoken too in a manor that I should know you and your company. From my perspective was given my money without my knowledge. I advised this to the agent and the supervisor. If someone told me this from the beginning of a call. I would not treat them like they should understand you, your process, and your company from the first time they call. Speaking down to someone who is calling for their freaking retirement savings, being moved to a company they don't know is just not only wrong, but clearly a bias your company has towards people who reach out for assistance. Respond and sugar coat whatever you think you need too. Try and save face. The honest truth is you were in the wrong and after review. You know it. Honestly, if your reading this... think about if someone you cared about called me up needing help for their savings account from one institution read freaking zero and I (who they don't know at all) have their money and spoke to them with the expectation of they should just ""know"" and I spoke down to them. What would you do? If you just read this and work at Millennium Trust and think it would be different? Find Michelle and go express how you feel. Your coworker does her job differently than you. You may not for ""However many years"" she has been doing it. Caught it yet. Start looking a little more closely. You will. Making a straight forward statement of ""I informed you sir"" when someone calls in a panic and explains that calmly then to be spoken down too about how I should ""know""... and dictate the process as I am looking at a screen ""saying it doesn't say that"" or giving a response of ""Well you can just google it""... vs assisting is not appreciated. Its a bit concerning that such an unconscious bias is allowed to be expressed at your company. Perhaps, you think this is ok. However, it's not anymore. Especially, to clients.",5

They have excellent customer service I…,"My 401K was automatically rolled over to this account when I left my previous job. It was difficult to find any information on how to navigate their website and how to access my IRA. Almost nothing could be done digitally - physical forms for every move had to be printed and submitted by mail or fax. I had very little communication from the company about what was happening with my IRA. Overall, I wasn't impressed and it was too difficult to make any changes so I opted to rollover again to a new company where I have more control over my money. If you like to do things old school, I'm sure this is a good option, but its not for me.",5

Very quick and responsive,"The representative answered my questions. I originally started via chat to inquire on my withdrawal request. Previously, Dave, was able to assist me via email. He did verify some basic info with me first. Jackie explained via chat that she could not assist me and I would need to call in. I explained I was helped before and she called me to verify me. She didn't sound enthused but I know another Jackie who is just as flat toned LOL.",5

Helpful  quick good service,"I didn't choose you but somehow ended up with you which turned out to be a regrettable experience. First of all you want to charge me a whopping $60 in fees for a $192 transaction, that's over 30%, didn't know you're in the loan shark business!! It has taken me the better part of a month to finally receive that $60 back from you. This included at least 6-8 conversations with your so-called customer service reps who sometimes were helpful but more often told me what I wanted to hear in hopes of getting rid of me ( otherwise known as lying) yeah it was only $60 but as someone smarter than me once said it's the principal of the situation. Well good bye farewell hopefully our paths don't cross in the future as I certainly won't easily forget my experiences with you.",4

Fast Easy and reliable!,Customer service was excellent. The young lady was very patient and knew exactly what I needed without very much explanation.,5
He was so patient,The process was very easy to make my withdrawal,5
Very easy and accessible,I didn’t like the fact that my account was transferred from an old employer and they immediately started charging me fees even though I had moved out of state and they didn’t have no where to send my information nor did I receive anything. My account was with them for a couple years not exactly sure when it was transferred but bout time they found me I had incurred so many fees it was ridiculous. Then they charged me to withdraw my money after they tacked on all the fees. Like it does not cost that much to house money. If I had a choice I wouldn’t go back with them nor recommend anyone else.,5
transfer of 401K,I had some initial frustrations because I was not aware that my 401k had been rolled over to Millenium Trust.  I ended up speaking to several representatives over the phone in order to locate my funds and then roll them into my current employer's 401k.  Millenium was committed to making sure that my needs were taken care of fully.,5
she was very very helpful,"My IRA was rolled over to Millennium after I was let go from a job.  The account was $1,899 at the time of the transfer.  By the time I withdrew my funds 2 years later, the account was only $1,650.  There were $35 fees every year...and the fund itself didn't grow at all.  If I would've had that money in my own pocket I could've easily made money on something like Robinhood (my personal brokerage account is up $10,000 this year).  The fees and the lack of effective investing are embarrassing.  How do you have $1,800 for two years and end up losing money?  Then charging me a fee because you don't know how to invest?  It's ridiculous.  The only reason I didn't give 1 star is because at least they made it easy (so far, at least) to request to withdraw my funds and close the account.",5

I realize you non-acat firm and are not held to the same quick turn around and it’s cash you are not moving as fast but it is still my asset and 7 months is ridiculous.

When I asked to withdrawal my IRA, I was redirected to another site, but it was unable to load my data and would not let me continue.  After several tries I gave up and tried another day and it worked this time.A year prior I was trying to rollover the money and I followed the Millennium instructions and submitted the needed forms to where I wanted it rolled over to.  After weeks, my new firm told me that Millennium needed to initiate the transfer and that I could not ask them to initiate it on their behalf.

Great,"I had received a letter from Millenium Trust, back in 2017, after I had been away from Munroe Regional Medical Center (now, Advent Health Ocala) for some time.  When I discovered the letter, in the process of packing up my home to move, I contacted Millenium Trust, regarding the possibility of still having some money to which I would be entitled.  The response was within seconds, and they provided easy access to the forms I needed to complete.  I am already aware of how much is in my IRA, how much I have requested to be deducted for the IRS, and I have some idea of how soon I will be receiving my payout, as a result of this excellent website.Thank you so very much, to all those involved with the resolution of my IRA!",5

Everyone I talked to at Millennium…,"Phone system dropped me three times. I know it wasn't on my end as the connection was crystal clear as I went through the IVR (which was itself inefficient) and then dropped after I was connected to an associate. Despite verifying 7 different pieces of information to prove my identity, I have to wait 1-2 business days for IT to call me back so I can get into my locked out account. Never had this issue with any other reputable financial institution...most can rectify this in 15 minutes. And instead of asking me to submit a survey to them about my experience (i.e. so they can resolve the issue), they want me to post a public review? Seems Millennium is very confident in their customer service. They shouldn't be. As soon as I can get into my account, I'm taking my business elsewhere. Good customer service isn't that expensive.",5

The online tools are very user friendly…,"I've closed an IRA before, and all I had to do was call the company. With Millennium, I called the company, and the CSR told me to register online and close the account myself. The first time I tried to register, the system was down. Days later, I was finally able to register. After the registration, it's still not clear to me how to close the account and just cash out what little money I have. I already earned that money; why do I now have to work hard to take it out? What am I being charged the processing fee for if I have to close it out myself online.",5

Thanks,"Being blamed for someone hacking into your system is inappropriate and so not professional.  I didn't pick you guys to handle my money, it was HSBC who must have contacted the least expensive group to transfer my funds to. OBVIOUSLY.

Solid experience,"Worst experience ever.  I did not choose this company, an old company I worked for dumped my IRA and Roth IRA here.  When it came time to get my money to a money manager that I trust and that was actually going to do something with it, it took more than 2 months to release my money.  No other reputable company takes more than 2-5 days to transfer the funds in my experience.  But this company it was always an excuse....  we didnt jump through this hoop or we didnt jump through that hoop, delaying the transfer another 10-14 days every time they had “found” an issue.",5

With both rejections, the representative we talked to requested paperwork or additional information that DIRECTLY CONTRADICTED the instructions on the form. In fact, the second representative contradicted the first representative and agreed with us about whether a letter from our bank was required. But, he went on to request additional information about account liquidation that the first representative did not require! This, despite the form clearly stating that the information is not necessary. If we could change custodians, we absolutely would.",5
Representative was very helpful and well trained,Fast and excellent service. Thanks.,5
Great customer service,"I called to request a paper copy of my statement for my account after it transitioned from the previous carrier and was told that one would be emailed to me-- it would be so much simpler to just have this available on the website rather than having to call, but I called and was told it would be emailed--it's the end of the business day and still no copy of my account in email but the survey of how Millinium handled it arrived.   Since what I needed was not taken care of, the review is not good.  Just give the option online and it would save me a lot of time.",5

Awesome!!,"I have been dealing with Millennium for a couple years now, trying to get a distribution from my sister's account, as she had passed away over 2 years ago.   Each of her beneficiaries on her account have been very frustrated going through the very long process of signing up to get their distributions.   Now we have watched the investment millennium was holding for my sister, lose over a third of its value, and have the investment's board of directors halt any distributions as it is going through a class action lawsuit.  So none of the beneficiaries have received a penny.    It looks like the investment my sister had through Millennium was not a good one.  I have wondered who advised her on this terrible investment.",5

Instead it would be much easier to request the check and them process it for you, but instead I had to talk to multiple reps (all were nice) but I kept having issues online registering bc my birthday was out in wrong when my account was received. I think 1 phone call, if I can fully verify my account..I think the rep should be able to process my check and send it out to me! It would be a lot more enjoyable for a customer. But all the reps I spoke today we’re wonderful and helpful and I was able to get it after about an hour.",5
Great customer service,I tried several times to get into my account on the webpage.  It kept invalidating my security answers and made me change my password.  It then locked out my account.I had to call into Customer Service to get into the account.  I was then informed that I would have to get a password encrypted email to access my statement in a few days.Incredible.  Just for a statement!  Took over an hour and now I have to wait days for more hoops to jump thru.,5
Appreciative,Answered all of our questions quickly and efficiently.,5
Customer service,"I called millennium trust regarding the account summary I received in the mail. I had no idea what company had set up this account for me so I was confused about the money and where it came from. The representative refused to tell me what company this account was set up through and insisted that I set up an account through the online portal where I would be able to find this information once I confirmed my account. Although a hassle, I created an account On the website where I was still unable to find the information I needed. Guess I will be making another phone call. Ugh.",4

Great customer service!,At first when activating my account the person was helpful and stepped me through it. I thought it would be great but soon realized why everyone gave negative reviews. I asked to transfer my account because trading on their for their website UI was to clunky and didn't give much information compared to other trading platforms. I requested a transfer that took 3 months. The platform I wanted to change to requested that they never received the check from Millennium. They sent it and apparently they delivered it. The two times I called I got two different dates saying they sent it. I waited patiently because they said it would take 2 weeks by mail. 1 month 1 week later I call back Millennium because those funds were not transferred or received by my new platform. Tired of their BS I stop the payment and request a wire transfer in which they charge me two separate $30 fees just for their crappy service. Terrible stay away from this company.,5

Problem solved,I had a small self directed IRA account through Fundrise that required using Millennium Trust. I decided after seven months I no longer wanted the funds in Fundrise. I filled out the forms for both companies to move the IRA to another site. This required four months and completed in Jan 2020. I now see a charge five months after the fact for the upcoming year from Millennium. I filled out all the forms to move all the money from all the companies back in 2020. I did everything absolutely 100% correct. Talking to both companies they point the finger to each other. I have no way to end this relationship... I can't close Millennium until Fundrise fully liquidates and when I ask Fundrise to fully liquidate they find another penny that was missed six months down the line after they said they liquidated.. Every form filled out means waiting months and months meanwhile the fees being charged exceed whats sitting left in the account..,5

Simple and reliable,"When the company I previously worked for sold, my 401k was transferred to Millennium Trust as an IRA. The timing was exceptionally terrible for me, and as someone not fortunate enough to have an accountant or tax adviser on call, this was not something I was comfortable managing. After numerous calls to my new employer's plan, and to millennium trust, and back again, I felt so trapped in the middle I gave up trying to move the funds to my new plan. Both told me the other company needed to initiate the transfer over and over. When I requested step by step instructions I received links to a video to watch. Will not recommend for anything other than a last resort.",5

Their ""Outgoing Transfer Instructions"" failed to mention going back into the Portal to request a direct rollover to your current employer’s plan, please click on ""Deposits & Transfers"" then ""Withdraw/Distribute"". That would've been quick and to the point. It took an extra email to customer support to figure this out. Also, MTC will NOT send a check to the new account, only to the account holder, who then has to send it on. (Extra, unnecessary steps, in my opinion)Lastly- the fees they charged are exorbitant, especially for the little amount my account had and the short amount of time they had it.",4

We both work regular hours, so we have to do this in the evening. When we run into a snag, the offices are closed and we cannot get any help. We have taken a few hours off work twice now, to try to resolve the issues. We have talked to several representatives. Every time we get to the last part of the questions on the site or with a representative , your site will not let us continue. On Friday we thought we were finally able to set up an account with Millennium only to find out that the site would not take our credit cards. (the credit cards are perfectly fine ) We were told that you would work on the problem. This is not working out for us. Your site is too convoluted and difficult to navigate. Our $10,000 that we wanted to invest with you will be going elsewhere. It should not be difficult to ask you to take our money!Thank you for asking about our experience. Steve",5
Wonderful experience.,"-- original review --My old 401(k) for some reason had money in it 20 years after I left the job and had rolled it over to an IRA elsewhere. I got a random email about the old 401(k) provider automatically rolling over my account for me to this trust company. Millennium effectively stole $60 worth of fees (6% of my total assets) from this account just so I could transfer it to my IRA elsewhere -- ""account establishment fee"" + ""annual fee"" (which they charge immediately) + ""account closing fee."" What a racket! Not to mention they have no easy way to do an electronic transfer to a large broker so I did an indirect rollover. You probably don't have a choice if you're using this place because you're likely dealing with a rollover of funds you didn't even know you had, but I feel ripped off.-- updated 5/17/21 --Got a call from Kamila who was very friendly and helpful, and she returned the initial account fees for me, leaving only the transfer fee, which is not a big deal since all trustees and custodians charge fees when you transfer your money out. Still, for an account that was moved without my knowledge (I blame Paychex for this part), it is frustrating to have to jump through hoops rather than just not being charged those fees if, for example, the account is transferred within a short period (days) after opening.",5

Site was easy to understand.,"I called twice about transferring funds and the representatives I spoke to gave me incorrect information and explained that the only way to move my money to my new employer was to have them contact millennium, which you all know if not policy. All along their was a place online for me to move my money and all that was needed was for your representative to provide me with help instead of making me feel like I would not be able to ever get my money out. Though the change is due to an employer change, and I never wanted to have this account in the first place (my past employer decided to move it without you or them alerting me first), I will never be moving my money here and plan to insist any company I work for not do business here either. All I needed was simply to roll out from this custodian and roll into a new one and the process has taken over 4 months. I expected this company to be the experts but apparently that’s not good business.",5

I guess my money is now there money.  I didn’t even want there company to be involved. If I would have known that this was going to happen, I would have asked my previous employer not to.  That 200$ is 2 weeks of groceries for my family of 6. They should have not charged me the 25$. I could understand if my amount was greater than 500$ to take the 25$ but come on.

"Excellent, Easy and Fast xxxxxx","My employers rolled my Wells Fargo 401k to Millennium when I resigned due to the pandemic. I do not recommend this company at all, they are not a real bank. I had no choice in this company, my former employer picked them. It's like my employer picked this company to add salt to a wound. Their fees are excessive, $35 to open the account (with my money), I will pay another $25 to Millennium to wire my money into a Rollover IRA until I find a new job. If I instead wanted a total distribution, they charge a massive percentage fee on top of the tax penalty fee and their account closing fee. Yes, that's 3 separate fees. The new financial institution I will be using does not charge yearly fees or fees to open the account, and they allow you to transfer to a new IRA without charging more fees. Plus, however Millennium is managing my account is terrible, it has lost money even though the market is improving. Whatever you earn in interest here, you will lose much more than that in fees. I've worked in banking, and this company is just terrible. Plus, when I called customer service, the employee just referred me back to the website. Why even have a call center then if we're forced to figure it out online anyway? She didn't understand their own fee schedule. Please choose a more well known institution who actually acts as your fiduciary, not to line their own pockets.",5

She verified who I was on the phone! These 2 accounts I have are from an employer 18 years ago. Y’all take fees out but there is no investing being done.  So it sits and y’all take fees. I just wanted my account number so that I could roll over to my existing portfolio. Now I have to send y’all a photo I’d with signature and passport info.  I hate my old company sold my account to yours. Very unhappy and dissatisfied. Just want my money and y’all can’t give to me.",5

They were professional,"My previous employer got acquired, so my 401K account was rolled over to Millennium Trust automatically, what a bad choice! Everything costs money. They charge $40 per year even if you don't do anything, and a paper statement fee of $12. And if you want to close your account, there is another charge! Not to mention that the sign-up process is complex and you have provide hard copy of the transfer form with your signature if you want to transfer your account out.

I would like to thank you for the help…,"I had difficulty with the online forms - the form kept on reloading and would not work and the site sent 50+ emails saying this.  When I contacted the company, I was told it was my problem because my internet wasn't working (not something wrong with the website).  I was also told that there was no way to do anything other than online by the first representative.  Needless to say my internet was working (as evidenced by the 50+ emails).  When I got through to the manager, she was very helpful and willing to help and we got the issue resolved.  I ranked this poor because of the website is less than user friendly (having done most of my banking / investments online for years), the initial interaction on the telephone was horrible.  Saving graces, they answered the phone quickly, and when I got through to the manager she was very helpful.",5

Great experience!!,Great and helpful,5
"Friendly & Knowledgeable, What’s to Think About!","My employer rolled over my retirement account into Millenium. When I left the company, this was not clear, and gaining access to my accounts has been an extreme nightmare. Once I finally jumped through all the hoops to access my accounts, there were no statements in the system. A statement is required to make any sort of transfer. To view the statement, you have to surpass a bot, request the statement, wait for an email, then CALL the company to get a password to open the email. All for an account that has existed for two years. This is absolutely absurd and I am so glad I'm finally making the steps to remove my funds from this institution that wants nothing more than to put barriers between individuals and their own money.",5

Great customer service,The most dishonest and thieving investment company ever. How can you take a $35 fee without any disclosure being sent notifying the customer before you take the fee out. I am taking my money once I get an account setup and going to a reputable company like Vanguard.,5
Great customer service,"I called for some assistance and with general questions.  I was having trouble accessing information, and wasn't certain whether it was my computer, the website or, to be honest, my my own lack of knowledge. I reached a real live person easily and quickly. She was very patient and made me feel at ease; I never felt rushed or that I was wasting her time. She offered suggestions and waited calmly while I went through the steps she recommended. She answered all my questions clearly and with understanding. She emailed me some info and offered tips for future reference.

I was informed this was not possible after being connected with a representative, who was polite, but not very helpful. It was very difficult to establish online access. I explained that I could not access my existing account, that was handed to them from Transamerica, after creating a profile and answering all online, security questions correctly (some were rejected as incorrect). He suggested I download google chrome and that would eliminate the problem.I politely refused to do so and was sent and email with a link to online access. I am finally able to log in, but still do not have access to my statements. I will be transferring all of my assets ASAP.",5

I needed to redeem my account,"Millennium Trust is a HORRIBLE company. Run away... if you still can. I don't believe any of the 5-star reviews. Could they be paid or promoted posts? I don't know. But my experience, for YEARS, has been awful. I have no idea how they are still in business.Here's my story to dispel any myth that I might be a disgruntled ex-employee. For the record, I've never worked at or for Millennium. My financial relationship with them is not voluntary: my employer forcibly transferred all 401(k) accounts to Millennium when the shareholders sold the company. Of course I received a paper notification of the transaction which gave me a short period to decline (10 or 15 days, I think). The postmark on the notice was a full 7 days are the date of the letter and it was mailed around December 15th. So will the crush of Christmas mail, I received the notice and option to decline AFTER the period had expired.That's when the fun began. This was back in 2015... and as of last week 2021, Millennium Trust still has my funds. I left multiple voice mails on their toll-free number since they did not answer the phone. I sent registered letters with a return receipt request. I even copied the Illinois State's Attorney. It was impossible to get my funds out because: (a) they did not answer the phone; (b) the response letter I received back required me to verify my account ownership first... but I did not have the Millennium Trust account number necessary to submit a request. Millennium made it very difficult to contact and impossible to transfer money out since one needs a recent statement to initiate a transfer.I found it very troubling that Millennium was acting as if they didn't have any identifying information on me. Yet they were able to receive my money, in my name, and had my mailing address in order to send a postcard notice. Fast forward to 2020. Last year, I posted a similar review here which finally prompted a response. A very kind Kamila Plata reached out to me and tried to help with my account. She was able to verify my ID and, eventually, generate a statement for me. Kamila would get 5-stars from me. Unfortunately, once I initiated a transfer the statement password expired (of course). Banks and financial institutions want a recent statement for a transfer, but all Millennium could provide was a Holdings Report.Millennium Trust's business model should not even be legal. To receive forcible transfers of 401k accounts (and probably other accounts) without the consent of the account owner is ridiculous. When I open a new account anywhere, it requires a lot of forms and at least one ID. But when an employer transfers money in, Millennium Trust says no problem if they don't have complete information such as the account owner's address, telephone, or any ID. Millennium Trust's business model is simply to take money in and then do everything possible to avoid transferring it out - at least that was my experience for 5 years. Of course account fees are charged while Millennium is holding onto you funds.",5

Further, I have not received any sort of contact or update from this group via mail, email, nor phone since DEC 2020.This account was opened in early 2019.

It finally shows up in the Millennium Trust account and to my utter surprise,  they charged me s $35 annual fee on the same day my money finally showed in the system.    Charging me an annual fee when my money just went over!!!   I sent an email and asked for a callback from someone, but only received a call back after I made another call and sent the email.  I was not a happy person.   I called back two days ago and asked to have the fee charge reversed.   Does not show anything about that.   Not happy.   I will never do business with them again.   The agent I spoke to was friendly, no complaints with the two or three people I spoke with.  After doing this review and a few phone calls,  my $35 was returned.  However, they charged me a $10 fee when I requested a disbursement.   So they returned my $35 but charged me a $10 fee in order for me to take my money out so they still made money from me.

I couldn’t figure out why I could not completely log onto my account when I finally called it was because the last letter of my name was left off. I had to send in a copy of my ID it was told it would be fixed the next day. I just called a week later and it was never input it. I had to do the whole process once again. I felt such little care for this as soon as I can login to my account I will be pulling my money from this company and not choosing to continue to use it,2

"Bad communication, not transferring money as requested",I requested for my IRA from my old job to be transferred to my current Financial Advisor months ago.

My Financial Advisor tried contacting Millennium Trust and they will not give any information or provide any direction.,1

At what point does ""higher than normal"" and ""longer than usual"" become ""normal"" and ""usual""?The solution? Hire more people, and/or pay the ones that you hire more money so that they stay.

IRA rollover request,I've been in the process of trying to get the funds from my IRA account rolled over to my new employers retirement account and it has been a nightmare. Millennium trust has emailed me time and time again that I did not submit the forms correctly even after following their instruction via phone and email on how to submit my rollover request. This has been going on for more than a month at this point. I'm not sure if they know what they are doing over there but this is definitely not a company I would work with. BEWARE!,1

Challenge to access account info,I had the most difficult time getting my account access and it should not have been so hard. Because I would not send my personal data and social security info on email this hindered me from getting access in a timely manner. The codes and access to login were also incorrect and I had to call multiple times and spend more time than I have on the line with a lovely customer service rep that kept telling me it was ok to send my personal info to their secure email but having had identify theft that was not ok for me. We finally agreed to a work around where I encrypted my document with a password and someone called me to open the file. But this was just not how business should be done. Very frustrating.,1

A mostly negative experience,"We transferred an IRA from Millennium to another provider. The experience was complicated and non-intuitive, and took 3 weeks from the date that the other provider submitted the transfer paperwork directly to Millennium. The other provider does not charge any of the fees that Millennium charges, including annual account maintenance (even if funds remain uninvested in a money market acct) and transfer related fees. The website was not very intuitive, especially when the transfer already occurred, there was no notification about this of any kind, online or via email (we had to call to confirm transfer status). The website kept looping to same page with no explanation why account access was not possible. The tier 1 customer support via phone was repeatedly rude. She did not allow asking clarifying questions, and instead transferred us with no explanation, putting on a 10 minute hold. Tier 2 customer support was a different story, knowledgeable and courteous. Terrible training and low standards for Tier 1 are a show stopper. Unfortunately, as a result of these experiences, Millennium falls far short of competition and I will never again use or recommend them. Much room for improvement.",1

I could not get money out of the 401 k today because I can only do one account at the time.

Waste of time and money,"My employer selected Millennium Trust to handle connecting me with the IRA they had established on my behalf. After I left my job, I wanted to roll over this balance to a ROTH IRA with Fidelity. Millennium Trust made the process exceptionally challenging to complete what I wanted to do. It took me at least 10-15 hours to talk to people on the phone, send emails, generate letters, find printers, and mail things. Somehow Millenium Trust requires wet signatures in our modern society. I started with the automated letter generator from Fidelity because it contained all the details Millenium Requested for doing a rollover. When I submitted the form as the systems specified, I was told I had made mistakes and that they could not complete my request. I then called Fidelity, and they helped me generate a different letter, and the agent confirmed that they deal with rolling over accounts with Millennium all the time - thus they were sure this would be an easy process. After mailing them this letter from Fidelity, they once again told me I had made a mistake and were unable to complete my request. Finally, I called Millenium, and the rude agent scoffed at my issue and directed me to another way to close the account.

Millenium had no record of me for weeks, even though the money was transferred electronically. Finally, after about 3 weeks and many pointless phone calls, they informed me that they found the transfer, but were missing some information, so were waiting on TIAA to get that to them. Finally, after a month, I was able to open an account. Had to pay a $35 fee for starters, which sucked. Then trades cost $8/each. I haven't paid for a stock trade in years! So that sucks. First stock purchase went through, but got an error message on second one. Something like ""could not execute trade. Ambiguous something..."" So I tried to trade again. Same error. I tried a third time, and only then, after more poking around, did I realize that hey... the trades had gone through. Dang. So multiple of the same trade at $8/pop. Ridiculous. Oh well, I figured I'd eat it. Next disappointment came the following day, when I tried to set up dividend reinvestment. Couldn't find any way to do that on the website. So I called in, and after some checking with others, the agent informed me that they don't do dividend reinvestment for stocks or ETF's, just for mutual funds. What garbage! So I'd need to manually come in every month and make a purchase (with a big trading fee!). Forget that. I decided to switch this Roth IRA over to Fidelity, which doesn't have crazy excess fees, doesn't lose my money for a month, actually does dividend reinvestment (DRIP) easily right on their webpage, etc, etc, etc. A far superior company. Every other brokerage I've used (TIAA, Transunion, Sofi, Etrade, etc, ) are all VASTLY better than Millenium Trust in every way I can imagine.

Operator was not helpful,All due respect I'm not pleased at all! I worked hard for what little money my past employer rolled over which was $908.50... Well since then I am so it has depreciated and I got hit with a lot of things and almost 7 months ago I requested from my bank which is synthetic credit Union for my money to be rolled over well on your end I guess you didn't get it and it was sent by my banker she is a manager who does her job efficiently so I don't know why anyone from mutual trust did not receive my transferred paperwork by the bank a financial institution. And it's taking me through a whole bunch of loops just to transfer my money so for that I'm really not liking this organization so hopefully I can get this issue resolved really soon I had to log on into the system and become a member and that was something I did not want to do I simply wanted my funds rolled over and transferred into my personal bank account which would make an IRA that I was trying to set up and that I will do very soon of course meanwhile by waiting on this process my money is dumbing down in your system and that's something I'm just not agreeing with!,1

customer Service is very poor.,"Requested disbursement of my account on 09/05/22, submitted documentation at that time to deposit it our joint checking account.  I called and spoke with Michelle in Pittsburgh on 9/13 to check the status of the disbursement and she said everything looked good and the funds should be in my account on 9/19/22.  I received an email on 9/15 saying there was an issue.  On 9/16/22, I went into the portal and uploaded a copy of the check again.  I then called to follow up and spoke with Jackie in Chicago who advised my name has to be on the check.  My name is on the account, however, we use checks minimally and have never ordered new checks with my name on the account.  The address is on the check and I offered to send a copy of the bank statement with my name on the account which is listed on the check.  They advised I would have to contact the bank, have them submit a one page document on letterhead with account number, routing number, and my name as being on the account.  My major issue is that now the process starts all over again and I have to wait 10 more business days for the funds to be processed.  If I would have known this when I spoke with Melissa, I could have addressed the issue then.  No matter what I do, the process starts all over again today and it will take 2 MORE weeks (10 business days) before the funds are processed.  I don't understand why the process has to start all over again.",1

They didn’t really help n customer…,"I my ex company didn't want to deal with managing their pensions any more I guess. So they transferred it to Millenium Trust into an IRA.  My IRA is less than $4K. It was set up with the following fees:1. $30/year for ""management"" (they literally do nothing, no investment strategy, nothing.  Just sits in an account earning 25 cents / month).2. They also charged me $10 just to send the notification in the mail to me that they now had my IRA funds.  And this $10 is also a yearly fee (for each annual report)By the time I was able to intervene, They had removed $70 from my IRA. And my ""managed"" retirement savings had earned $3.3. Oh, and as a final parting display of Wall Street greed, they will take another $25 from my savings as a ""Closing Account Fee"" when I roll it into my Roth, which is managed by an honest company with NO yearly fees. Thanks for robbing a poor working stiff's miniscule retirement savings.  Enjoy your ill-gotten gains.  We are sharpening the guillotine for all of you Wall Street leeches.  The pitch-forks are coming.UPDATE: To their credit, Millenium Trust called me after this review and restored the $70 in maintenance fees they had so far taken out.  I'm still going to transfer my money out though, and will still pay the $25 fee to close the account.  But I appreciate this gesture from them.",1

Every person I have talked to always…,"Millennium Trust's customer service for individual account holders sucks. It does everything in its power to put a customer through automated chatbots, which can be decent guides for people who don't actually educate themselves with what the website has to offer, but is a black hole for when you need the answer to a question that the website does not clarify. Their ""live contact"" link goes to what appears to be a chat window, with ""live chat"" in big letters, and ""waiting for agent"" at the top. Truth is, agent will never come. But they never tell you that. They're trying to lead you through a tree of questions, where all it does is give you links to other parts of their website. And it actually has nothing to do with the availability of an agent during business hours. This is the experience 24/7.At some point, the chatbot will eventually tell you that if you need more help, to contact support. Isn't that *exactly* what this Support Link/Live Chat is supposed to be? (and this Contact page to get support is itself conveniently buried under ""Profile"", otherwise you won't find it anywhere else). And when they tell you to contact support, they don't even specify how. It takes another path through Q&A to get to the point where they give you a number to call (these places usually do a great job of hiding any contact phone number).  When you call the number, of course it tries to keep you away from a real person for as long as possible, but if you call during (east coast) business hours, eventually you'll  get a real person.I eventually was able to talk to a real person, but it took me from a Friday to Monday morning to realize what was going on and how things worked. The interaction with the agent itself was fine and this is not a commentary on the experience with the agent.I understand that Millennium Trust is probably built to serve large institutions more than retail account holders, but still, that bulls*** ""live chat"" and ""waiting for agent"" is exceptionally and purposely deceptive.",1
I have yet to receive my transfer,"my call was taken by Yolanda from Nevada. She started off speaking very quickly and I had to ask her to slow down. Her directions were unclear to me. When I explained what I wanted, she sarcastically said that's called a rollover"". i asked her if she was going to help me with the rollover process she said yes. She asked me for my personal information so I gave it to her. She then emailed me a long letter with a link, told me to read it and fill it out. She explained I need to put in all my details which I had just provided to her. Confused, I explained I just gave it to her and she said I need to add more information. Being that is was lengthy email with instructions, I was unclear if she would stay on the line while I read through the email and link attached, etc. to guide me through it. She said yes she would (what I understood as she would stay on the line). Yolanda abruptly ended the call. Prior to contacting Mellinnium Trust I had been on the phone with customer reps from both Transamerica and Prudential (now Empower). Their customer service was excellent. Although I was withdrawing my 403b funds and I never created an online account with Transamerica, the representative walked me through the rollover process. He explained their process, went over email he sent as while we were on the telephone and even made a conference call to Prudential.  They both helped thru the process in a respectful, coherent and patient manner. If my call had been calling Mellinnium Trust for  anything other than rolling over, it would have definitely turned into a rollover after her poor service.",1

I called customer service & the automated system try’s to keep you from speaking to an agent saying that they have high call volume. As I kept asking for an agent then Im told my hold time is less than 2minutes (high call volume). Once the agent answered his demeanor was that he was being bothered to the point you could hear sighs. The most he could tell me was there is a delay, we could mail you a check which would take longer through the mail. I only had little interaction with this company but the little I had was not good & it’s not a company I would want to do business with in the future.",1

I was told the notes from my call three weeks ago stated I was advised to talk to a tax professional and that was it. Totally inaccurate. I had to resubmit the same form three times and finally got confirmation it went through, but I had gotten the same confirmation last time, and when I told the person on the phone that, and she flatly didn't believe me. She didn't even consider looking into whether what I was saying was true. My experience with this company has shown them to be confusing, inefficient, ineffective, and inaccurate. Companies like this are the reason there are laws against being unnecessarily and intentionally obtuse in order to bilk people out of their money. If you've been notified Millennium Trust has taken over an account of yours, start the process to get it out of their hands immediately.",2

They charged me the $100 which is my future year’s fee for handling, and $100 for closing my account since my disbursement was $2700 the balance of my 401k before taxes. They justified by saying I was late paying. So they took me coming and going. I have now paid a fee for next year AND I’ve paid for closing the account. I tried explaining too that I had sent a check to them and Hard Assets each at the same time. Hard Aseets received theirs fine but Millenium never cashed theirs.

Absolutely the worst,"Millennium Trust received a transfer of pension-related funds belonging to me about which they did not notify me over the past 10 years plus.

Millennium Trust has been charging me a maintenance fee since receipt of my money. Upon learning about these funds, I contacted them ten days ago to initiate the process for transferring the money into a 401K. They instructed me to complete a form and wait for a follow up email from them to continue and conclude the transfer process. I have yet to receive anything from them (except for this comment request). Significantly, I also do not know whether or not they will refund the maintenance fees they extracted, because they did not bother to obtain an updated address for me.

I’ve been trying to complete a roll…,No money yet but transaction is complete? Interesting.,1
Terrible communication,I had a low dollar amount invested for a short stint at an employer before I rolled over to my current employers’s plan. Granted it was invested for no more than 2 years but I never saw any gains and instead saw my balance decrease as a result of annual and administrative fees. I do appreciate them reaching out after my original review.,1
Could of done the same thing myself,"A balance from a previous employer’s 401k rolled over into a Millennium Trust IRA without my knowledge. No one can explain to me why the balance remained in the 401k in the first place (I rolled the account over 3 months after separating from my previous employer and 10 months before the current balance was transferred to MT). I filled out paperwork prepared by my bank to transfer from MT to my preferred IRA, but I’m receiving email messages that claim there’s not sufficient information to perform the rollover (including missing my signature—which I absolutely signed). MT’s web portals are buggy and poorly designed. Phone and chat “support” is really geared toward providing no support at all (or at least only functionality that is already available in other formats). When I was able to speak with an agent, they were helpful. However, the automated menu systems are obstructive, actively discouraging me from trying to talk with an agent. Basically, I’m giving MT $30 to complicate my life with adminstrata that should have been settled months ago.",2
All I wanted to was get the things .,Account transferred to MT and not easily transferred to other main account.  Excessive fees for maintenance?  Fees for printed statements.,1
I became a Mtrust customer by default…,"My former employer rolled my account over to Millennium Trust. In order to claim my account I was required to provide a great deal of personal identifiable information as well as my email address and phone number. Millennium did not send a code in response to the phone verification. Consequently, I had to jump through additional hoops. After this horrible experience, and in a separate transaction on the same day, I received a message stating that requested information was not received, when in fact I submitted this information twice. If Millennium is relying on technology, the technology needs to be operational. I spent far too much time on this site. Far, far too much time.",2

Couldn’t even talk to a human,"Millennium Trust is like ""The Last Jedi"" of financial companies - somehow it has good ratings with the BBB and such, like ""The Last Jedi"" had good reviews from critics, but the customer/viewer experience seems to be waaayyyyyy different. This company has been slowly draining my account with fees for years, and makes it so hard to actually move MY OWN MONEY out of their stranglehold that I've started the process and given up several times (their intent, I'm sure, with the convoluted processes and iffy customer service).Do yourself a favor and if your company puts your retirement into their care, get out as quickly as you possibly can.",1

So i try to get my money sent to me. The original company tells me since my previous employer closed the 401 k plan my money was sent to your company. They gave me ur phone number, so i called get told to get my money i have to use a web portal and create an account juat to withdraw my money. Try to create an account tells me my information is wrong or no account. So i called again woman said oh there is a typo on ur personal info. Wont tell me what the typo is just that i have to fill out another form updating there records so once i get an email back that it was updated i can create an account then. So i got said email went to do it all again and it says my account has been claimed already. Whatever that means. Im very mad. Never wanted to do business with your company. Now im being forced to. I want my damn money now",2
Impossible to create new login.,Customer service wasn't very good. Then I was accused of being hostile no one knew what TSP was.,1
Website is very difficult to navigate,Terrible experience. Cust service phone number totally useless; took 10 mins of button pushing and listening to music to get to a human being.  The first human took a lot of information from me which I had already provided to the  automated system.  Then this person said she could not help me and needed to transfer me to someone else.  Another 5 mins listening to music and then got someone who asked for the same identifying information all over again.,2

I was told to wait a few days and saw nothing change in my account. Only after I left this review did I get a voicemail three days later from Pauline telling me they’re waiving my fees and pressuring me to write another review. I then get another call from another person pressuring me again, very vehemently, to write a new review before they actually did what they said they would do. If you have an account that rolled over, I would remove my funds immediately. They skirt the lines of ethics and rely on shady, near duplicitous tactics to maintain any sense of a reputation.",1
How can i do a demand  on you ???,"I have been trying to 'work' with Millenium Trust for two months now, to simply transfer cash from two custodial accounts over to an equivalent account on their platform. I've worked with a couple other custodians and this is typically filling out the appropriate forms and then waiting for the transfer to happen - that's not the case with Millenium Trust. I have many HOURS invested in filling out forms on their web site and then following-up to make sure they act on them, only to be sent the same forms via hardcopy (sometime 2 or three times) as if I hadn't filled them out already. Then, following-up on the new forms because no action takes place from there....and wait, and wait and then follow-up again. Trying to get a human on the phone there is a chore because they have automated menus that try to deter human contact - be it phone or chat. Trying to get simple beneficiary information entered properly was another matter - again, fill out their only form and then they complain that I need to fill out this 'other' form because I had submitted a trust, which I had not and I made that clear to them three times. Add to the tab three or four follow-ups to get them to fix both my beneficiary accounts because they either didn't act on my wishes or didn't act as indicated on the form. I  think Millenium Trust probably have good people working there, but their processes demonstrate a culture of ineptitude and I'm perplexed why Fundrise is requiring I work with them for custodial services because I'm not going to move any more of my retirement funds into Millenium Trust - life is too short to have to micro-manage my account custodian and since they are responsible for my retirement funds, that is of grave concern to me.",1
Poor Customer Experience,My previous company rolled over my401k to this company. Feels pretty predatory that I had to open an account and pay an account closure fee to transfer my IRA to my custodian of choice instead of them just releasing my 401k.

I got duplicate verification codes, multiple times (and no - I didn't click the button more than once to generate a code).  I must admit that clicking the button twice to generate a code would have been an intuitive thing to do, as it took an UNREASONABLY LONG TIME for the code to be texted to the user (me).  Apparently, Millenium Trust is using an inferior, low-cost SMS provider with terrible latency.  So - fair warning:  if you have an iphone, and you seek to verify your identity using SMS, you will likely get TWO verification codes sent to you, one immediately after the other, but you will have to wait an inordinately long period of time to get these two codes.  The next, begged question is ""which code do I enter?"" Logic would suggest to enter the more recent code.  DON'T DO THIS - it will fail.  Enter the first code sent - this is the only way I was able to get it to work.  Do you see the picture here ?  UNACCEPTABLE - AMATEUR HOUR.

This was a little more fruitful, I finally got a REAL Person. But he was not able to get me satisfied. I asked for a supervisor who finally showed me an end to my quest. I'm being sent my account numbers so I can transfer funds to my local account. If there was a lower rating I would give it.

My advisor at Vanguard has been calling your team everyday and the response is “waiting for liquidation”. It’s a simple target retirement mutual fund. This doesn’t take that long. Until the transfer actually happens, I will continue to update this review. Jun 29: It has been a month and a half since I initiated a request to transfer my IRA to another account. After a lot of paperwork plus two follow-up calls, the money is still with them. I have no idea how to get my money out at this point because clearly even phone calls where they promised it will be taken care of had led to no action.",1

It’s been a month and no withdrawal,Well 1 my name is spelt wrong on the email for this review. 2 I started on my distribution early June I was on the phone with Kevin who told me everything was good and all I need to do was send a voided check. Then after the so-called 5 days to review I haven’t received anything so I was worried with having to send a voided check. So I called and I was told my distribution was started but not completed. So after waiting 5 days already now I would have to finish it and wait another 5-7 days for my distribution. Which I needed it days ago and if I didn’t call I would of knew known no one sent a email or called about it. Again just told me after I filled everything out to send a void check and that’s all I needed to do. But when I called back after not receiving anything in my account I talked to a lady who set on the phone with me made sure I got the email and walked me through everything. That’s why I gave a 2 star because that lady was VERY helpful but the experience and lack of communication and still to this day having to wait longer for my distribution is why I rated so low. So hopefully I get it soon.,1

I never got a notification in regard my…,Agent was great but the process to recover funds is terrible. Not many places have checks and you have more than enough information to process a distribution over the phone like fidelity and other banks. I will never leave my money with your financial institution in the future. I’m trying to secure funds quickly for a house and you have delayed my process. Very very dissatisfied.Not sure if right hand talks to the left. I received a call saying I needed to submit an additional signature page and was sent 2 emails. I called back and they confirmed I needed to resubmit the same documents since they don't take electronic signatures like docusign(another failing) and a signature page. I submitted the documents immediately yet they called back 2 hours later saying they read my review and asking if I resubmitted my documents. I guess they didn't check before calling. I wish I could give a zero for this process. Looking forward to staying only with Fidelity in the future.,1

Excessive fees,So far one of the worst companies I have ever dealt with. My account was rolled over to them two weeks ago. I did not receive notification. I have not received an account number. The process to roll it back to Fidelity is cumbersome and time consuming. Very stressful experience.,1
I tried calling for my account number…,I have been on hold for over an hour!  I want to transfer my IRA account because Millennium Trust charges $35 per year to manage my IRA and a $25 penalty if I wish to transfer to a different management company. AWFUL!,1

Terrible customer service,"Every encounter I have had with your company has been difficult, and it usually takes me at least 4 different visits and hours of my time to accomplish the most basic tasks.

Can’t give a review,You dropped the ball on transferring money to my Schwab account.,2
Thank you for your service,I am severely displease with the fact the very small amount of money from the 401k that was never supposed to have been sent to this bank. I was charged fees on money that was parked in addition to not allowing me to correct the name in the bank information as I had gotten divorce and dropped the married name. their chat does not provide the customer service needed either.,2
The worst,"The world would be a better place if this company went out of business. They fail at their basic functions.  UX is terrible, confusing and difficult to navigate. Customer service is awful.

Beware of Suspect Practices,"I called in and spoke to a woman about getting my money rolled over. She said it was done online and that she would send instructions to my email. She never did. I guess she didn’t like it when she asked me to spell my email address to her, which wasn’t hard to figure out and I refused to. It was two common words followed by a number. Not very difficult. So with no instructions being sent, I had to figure it out myself. I did it myself. Thanks customer service for doing nothing for me. I love the message you get saying that you are extremely busy and the gold times are long. I never waited more than 20 seconds to speak to someone. Update your phone messages please.",1

Unnecessary charge when I had to fill out all the paperwork despite having had just created and updated my new account profile. So yeah. Not happy with them. But I will be done with them shortly.",1

But then when I called in, David claimed he never received it.  So I asked him, why did you send me an email saying you received it?  To which he replied he must have lost it.  Are you kidding me?  So I sent it again, he received it, he verified the wiring instructions and told me it would be processed that day (Friday).  Well it wasn't processed.  So on Monday morning I called and talked to Melanie and she talked to Sarah in Processing, and they assured me it would be processed by end of day.  Well, end of day came and went, still not processed.  So I called again, after talking to Melanie, she put me through to Sarah who explained she didn't get to it.  Again, are you kidding me?  I've now been told that it will be processed tomorrow.  We'll see...",2

Bad customer service,"The online platform is horrible. I STILL don't know how to access a monthly statement. You automated phone service was so bad, i requested communication via e-mail. At one point, I was asked to provide a password I was never given. When I did speak with a human being, she was helpful, and professional. I don't understand why trying to consolidate this puny IRA has been such a headache.",2
Difficult encounters,No one notified me of creating account when I received the letter it was 3 weeks after account being created. Making it so I would not be able to get my full investment. The letter states within 7 days the company is sure to notify you by mail well after receiving and setting up account.,1
Too long a wait,I think your processes are too slow. I also think we should be able to set up a speedier system once cash hits our account to be transferred out. We seem to be paying for a trustee service that doesn't provide a good customer experience,1
Booooo,I have sent in my SS card twice to verify and a letter from the bank twice to get my money and still haven't heard anything. My fellow employee did hers the same day as me and she didn't have to have any type of verification and had her money in her account within two days.,1

It didn't seem to me like they were well trained because they fumbled over their words. However, I do have to give kudos to Grear. She was amazing! We lost connection once, and she called me back right away. While one of the rude representatives did not call me back when either she hanged up or lost connection.",1

It may not bother someone with a huge principal amount, this happened to be a small one - IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE AND MORALLY BANKRUPT. I have asked for the fees to be replaced to my account.

Brenda informed me that MT sent my money to my bank and the bank sent it back to them, it will be $30 charge for having to send it twice. Okay whatever fine, just send it again. They said they needed me to send them a voided check to make sure the account number and all is correct. So I sent the check to them last week and have sent a couple follow up emails.

They take a chunk of fees annually, but I have less than $1 dividends so they, in essence will eventually take ALL of my money if I stay with them. My opinion is if they are going to receive people retirement money and take a chunk from it then they need to be more proactive at communicating to those people about they money and how they can help with investments; otherwise, they have not earned those large fees they are so happy taking!No message has been received and communion should have happened prior to my account sitting for so long while only receiving less than $0.30 monthly in dividends.",1

When I get calls from people there, I'm asked for my name, birthdate, address, last four of my SSN just to confirm my identity.  But I have no way to confirm that I'm actually getting a call from Millennium Trust.  I attempted a few times to tell them I don't share that information when somebody calls me and told them I would call back using a number on the Millennium Trust website. This just ended with me getting stuck in an endless loop of a phone system that doesn't want to actually get me in touch with somebody; it just repeats over and over again that I need to make an account online.  Which I can't do without providing an unreasonable amount of personal information to someone over the phone apparently.At one point after having to verify all that  information with someone who had called my phone, I was asked to email the company a copy of my driver's license.  I've been trying to make an online account with them for a while now and figure it's my only option.  But this definitely felt like it might be a scam.  And is not a great way for me or the company to protect my personal information.I think if Millennium Trust allowed you to create an account on their website before linking you to the account with the money, it would solve some of this problem.  That way documents could be uploaded to the website on your account, you definitely wouldn't need to email anyone a copy of your driver's license, forms could be approved or not approved through the account, and nobody from the company would need to call you.",1

Overcharging for a rollover and high…,Not apart of ACATS so it takes forever to transfer out.,1
Disappointed,Never will I recommend this company to a person. They will take your money in seconds then make you wait weeks to maybe get it back and if your in  emergency they will stall and delay and make you feel air and not give a thought about you. They’ll let you go homeless and loose you car while saying it takes 15 businesses days to get you your money back even tho you bank with a company that it a partner company. Horse poop company and will never put a penny into it company again!!!!,2
Still waiting on tax return paper,"the customer service is terrible, I have an account and I was talking so that they would not charge me for the maintenance of the account and even if I filled out the form they always charged me for the maintenance of the papers, I called customer service and they told me you do not have a user account and I always had one and then they tell me the system changed and they never told me anything?  and they always charged the maintenance bad company I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT",1
Lack of customer service,"Working with their online agent was a nightmare. The agent was not accurately reading what I was writing, was intrusive on my rights as a client,  and gave me incorrect information. I will be transferring my assets out of millennium trust ASAP due to this interaction.Also in response to the below response from MTrust. This response perfectly illustrates how you do not listen. Why would you call my cell phone when I made it explicitly clear to your agent (in a well documented conversation) that my phone is NOT WORKING and I cannot use it. Thus why would you contact me via the phone and then recommend me to call you. It's absolutely amazing the incompetence level",1

The rep put me on hold on the phone and…,My former company rolled my account over to you without my permission. I sent paperwork directing them to roll over to another company. So I have been charged an annual fee of $30.00 without my knowledge or permission.

Happy to be moving it over to a place that will actually invest it for me and  help me grow it rather than taking it all for themselves.Edit to respond to their response: That doesn't change the fact that Millennium does nothing but nickel and dime their customers to provide ZERO service. Still glad I am moving away from them.",2
Person did not listen,"I have been with Millennium for about 10 years.  For many years they were great and had wonderful customer service and response time.  However, MTC, like just about every other company in the US that isn't a mom and pop organization, have gone to the default model of not hiring adequate staff.  I have needed to contact them twice in the last few days, and have waited on hold in excess of 45 minutes on both occasions.  This is not on customer service people but on management.  To my way of thinking, wait times of over 15 minutes are absolutely unacceptable.  HIRE SOME MORE PEOPLE!!!",1

By the time this happened, I had already resigned from my position and moved to another state to attend graduate school.

After years of NO REPLY from me, no one from this company thought it best to try to reach out to me by any other form. No one searched for a death certificate or anything to know why I was not responding. Worst, while the money was sitting here for about 4 years, they were taking ""admin charges"" or ""maintenance charges"" from the little money that I had no idea was with this company. My money had been sitting at this company for years and by the time I got a letter on the off-chance I returned to my previous address just a few weeks ago, I learned that the money that had originally been with the company had dwindled to roughly 1/2 of the original amount because of the fees they were charging for just holding my money, not even investing it or doing anything with it. No one decided to track me down via any other means except by letter, which was being sent to my parent's address, where I had not lived in years! If this were the other way around and I OWED this company money, I would get calls, emails, and all other forms of communication from this  company so they could recoup their funds.

I am in disbelief in the level of accountability this company and its representatives have in helping the consumer. I was told by a supervisor Yesenia P. that it was MY responsibility and the organization does not bare a fiduciary responsibility to the customers because the account was transferred to Millennium Trust from my previous employer. There was no attempt to empathize or understand the situation from the customer viewpoint. I understand parameters and guidelines are created for the best interest of the company, but the customer loses when there are charges put an account every year for 10 years without the customers knowledge nor authorization. I will never do business with a company that values their bottom line and forgoes the customer experience. Maybe losing one more customer does not impact you but the treatment I have received will have a lasting impression on me, my family and every person I tell this story to.Update: when I titled this review as “Disingenuous Representatives” I was referring to the few that I have come in contact with. After speaking with the manager Mike P, I am beginning to think that is the culture of Millennium Trust. Mike P. did not reach out to me to provide help, he wanted to further explain why the company is justified in charging me hundreds of dollars. The justification was: 1) address search they conducted (hard to believe when information is readily available with today’s technology), 2) having the ability to access my account online (even though I never used the service), and 3) the funds were held in their institution (even though I am responsible in managing my own account for any gain). The most insulating part of the conversation is when he offered to waive my fees to close my account. I am not aware of any financial institution that charges $20 because they can not send you a statement, $40 annually because the funds are sitting in an account they do not manage, and $25 to close the account.  The intent of this organization is to deplete the account by any means available. Per Mike P. they will keep charging fees until the account is at a zero balance. This organization doesn’t seem to have an escheatment process, it charges fees until there is no funds left. Why would anyone want to be a customer when their intent is clear.",1

While the personnel were polite, the process is extremely difficult and appears to be geared to obstacles in requesting ones distribution. What’s tragic is in this case we are speaking of under 2,000.00 which I’m sure is nominal in most dollar amounts. Recently I’ve had the experience of dealing with the New York Life Annuities Group and was truly treated professionally, equipped at every juncture to access what was mine, and then offered investment options for consideration. And truthfully they were dealing with over 300,000.00 rather than a mere 1600.00. Night and day is what I would call this experience. The customer service was professional, personable, helpful at every turn with even a follow up two days later to be sure I was pleased with their service and the outcome of my decisions (NY Annuities Group)   And then compare the pervious to this…from the Millennium Group:    The response was simply all of our processing is done online and we don’t have the ability to help you (Milllenium group). Isn’t “customer service” focused on the customers experience and the the convenience of a process designed strictly to be done online?  Or maybe I expect too much!",1
I am still having difficulty trying to…,"Horrible,can’t get into my account,been going on for a year.they are NO help.",1
Trying to get my account number for…,"I am trying to roll over from my Millennium account and your process makes this very difficult. Someone should look at that.I thought I had a solution once we spoke, but was disappointed again. When I called in wait time was 10-15 minutes. Schwab requested a copy of my most recent statement and when I tried to log into the portal, I could not even update my password. These are IT problems, not customer service problems. Someone on the web apps team needs to check their customer experience better.",2
Can't recommend Millennium Trust,Website is very unfriendly to users. Frustrating experience just to move a rollover account.,1
Long wait for service,You guys suck.,2
Charge a bunch of fees but do nothing,The request for distribution was not easy.  I was charge for service fees twice to get my distribution.,1
Too long on hold,"I did not chose to use Millennium I was forced to by my bankrupt employer who transferred my 401k to Millennium.  To get set up and your money out is very arduous.  I am glad I don't need the money immediately, but would not recommend this group to anyone.",2
I have two (2) MT Trust accounts,You charged a fee on my account when I was not contacted that my funds had been transferred to you and then charged me a fee when I closed  the account.No email or phone call to inform me of the situation.,2
I have tried to call multiple times…,Still have not gotten my card with my funds on it .,1
Millennium Trust Company is terrible,The fees are often and high. I never wanted to do business here it was an ira rollover from a previous employer. No one should willing want to do business with a company who wants to fee their customers to death.  Even to close account yet another fee. They should be investigated and no one should do business with them. Called to talk to someone its 100% automated and to transfer funds takes forever you have to do it online only. This place needs to go out of business. Hope people files complaints with the district attorneys.  I see the same reply about fees to all. That's why I roll everything to etrade no BS fees like this scam company. They only want to charge fees and suck you dry look at the reviews over and over and over again.,1
Rude in the phone ☎️,I don't like the fact my mind my mind ney was suppose to be mailed to me then I get a letter my old employer got to decide what to do with the money I worked for I AM STILL.WAITING ON MY MONEY I'm not happy,1

My hard earned money was stolen from…,"My retirement accounts were transferred to Millenium.  I attempted to log in through the website.  Only one account would show up despite repeated efforts.  I attempted to reach MTC by phone at the number in BOLD at the top of the paperwork.  ""Call volume"" meant the phone system would NOT let me speak to a customer service representative and directed me to call back between 5pm-8pm Central time or 8-noon on Saturday.  Calls at these hours were greeted with ""office is closed, call back during normal business hours.""  I got up at 5 am my time to reach someone in person at MTC after a 5 minute phone tree and a 10 minute wait.",1
Too complicated the process,Terrible customer service. Very slow and it feels like you are being difficult on purpose so I can't pull my money out and you can keep taking high fees. Disgraceful and I can't be done with this company fast enough.,2

Instead they never sent the paperwork they assured me would arrive, and continued to not communicate with me or keep me my investments working.

Never received great customer service and feel preyed upon because I was young investor with no knowledge of how to use my tools/account.",2
$35 annual fee,This is the most useless company to invest in. The bank gives better interest.

Terrible Company with Predatory Nature!,"I was new to Millennium Trust because an account with a former employer was rolled over to them.  I appreciated TMT's diligence in reaching me about this account. Once they found me it took several months to get my account open due to some technical glitch and reps kept sending me the same non working solution.  When I was able to reach a person, several months later I was talked into how to solve the glitch and that was great customer service.  I then received another communique about stuff I had to do to verify the opening of my account. Annoying. Did that. Get into my account to see the amount that's been rolled over.  Too small to leave with MTM, BUT I loved how the site worked once inside. Decide to get distribution of that amount but want to keep the TMT for other funds I'd load later in the year.  Getting the distribution, which I want to invest elsewhere I have to leave $200 in or forced to close the account.  I don't like that, decide to take the full  distribution. TMT charges me $25 to close the account I'm forced to close! That feels predatory....Dang, thought this company would be a strong solution to other funds I want to invest.  NOT going to happen because, in the end of all things, too difficult to access and sign up for funds they have told me are in their holdings for me, then too difficult to keep a relationship that I would have wanted with the company going. Not a problem, I have other investment companies that don't have this difficulty or exorbitant fees to the client for following policies the company has put into place in order to have a relationship with its client.",1

Terrible customer service,I am not happy that I have to pay $10.00 dollars to close this account when the balance is $ 24.00 dollars.,1
My experience was not great,You have stolen my few dollar i had with your company in outrageous fees. No wonder you keep on getting richer. You never notify me of this fees and don’t receive a statement. Last time I contacted you was in 2014 and at that time there were no fees incurred.,1
Retired from that position in 2014,My IRA just shark I thought it was being managed.,1

Millennium Trust is corrupt,My money was transferred from my previous employer in the amount of 2000.00.  Over the past 4 years I received statements with the balance reducing each time.  Nothing was done to increase it or to ask if I wanted to add or do something different with it.,1
I have $280 in the ira account and…,401k was moved here and converted to an IRA. Money was no longer invested in the funds that I thought it was. I did not realize this happened for quite some time. They claim I was sent a welcome package but I do not recall seeing it. After I got my yearly statement it was dissapointing to see that I lost money due to fees despite my other mutual funds doing so well.,1
Not user friendly and costly,"It felt overwhelming and confusing to rollover my funds. I feel like the instructions to roll over can be made in a more user friendly format instead of a monolith of a list. Customer service was a little impatient when I was asking questions. Understandable, but also didn't feel nice.",1
Difficult to work with,Too many fees! Wow,1
Rollover,"My money was illegally transferred into this account and then I was charged $60 + additional $25 to retrieve it. This issue has been reported to the FTC.

Functional UI but dated look & feel,You directly stated in a phone call you made to me that you would waive the $10 close account fee as a courtesy due to the small account balance.  You told me this at 2:30 pm. I closed the account at 8 pm the same day. The next day the account close fee of $10 was taken. A complete lack of integrity by Millennium Trust.,2
Do not trust this company,Website is not helpful. Unable to access account and complete actions. Website sends you back to old forms.,1
After the transfer of the company,"I am retired and live full time in La Paz bcs Mexico.I have no ties in the USA.

Also there was Zero follow up after I was finally approved.I had no idea I had completed the paperwork correctly until the wrong dollar amount showed up in my Bank account.I was told by the last representative that she would call me back in 1/2 hour to update me on what was going on. She called 3-1/2 hours latter when I was in my car driving and couldn't answer the phone.A simple remedy would be to assign a client service to my case so I wouldn't have to repeat everything each time I spoke to a new person.

You are welcome for my small contribution to your wealth.,It is impossible to get a to a live person. My previous employer transferred my account against my wished even though I had already requested disbursement through previous company. Then in order to have my account opened and closed within a few minutes I was charged both an annual fee as well as an account closing fee. This is ridiculous. There was no work or effort done. I had your account for a total of 5 minutes yet you justify taking $55 out of my money for what exactly. This is a total joke and would never even considering investing with you guys. Apart from that tried to use your customer chat which is not a chat. It is is simply a commonly asked questions search. Then emailed your company 3 separate times and have yet to receive a single response yet it says you will contact same day or at latest 24-48 hours later. Horrible service,1

It appeared they hired specifically trained people to work to not make this happen, and to make it so difficult to move money out of their company that the customer would just give up.

To be clear about the ""it's your responsibility"" line - My old company made no efforts to contact me at my updated addresses to let me know that this was being done, and MTC took their sweet time finding me as well despite all my address changes being a matter of public record with the postal service. MTC operates fully within the broad auspices of finance law, but that doesn't mean their service is worth using or that their business practices will benefit you in any way, shape, or form.

I was not notified of this change to my plan so I immediately closed the account and requested my money be returned to me. Millennium Trust, without any advance notification, charged $30 for an annual fee and then charged $25 processing fee for me to have my money returned to me. This all feels very dishonest, inspite of their explanation for their actions.",1
Long wait times on hold to reach an…,The literal worst customer service. You cannot talk to a human being and I have had nothing but problems with them.,2
Lack of clarity.,My employer moved my 401k to this company. First day my account was charged $35. Same day I closed my account and was charged another $25. Ridiculous amount of fees. I would never use or recommend this company to anyone.,2
Fees are wayy to high,"Short and simple, my 401k was transferred from Transamerica retirement plan to the millennium trust. My account gained only $5 in a 12 month period. On the other hand , I was charged by Millenium trust $30(annual account fee) and $25 (closing account fee) for moving funds to my bank account. Just do the math, horrible experience from beginning to end.",1
What a joke,"Horrible customer service. Then I’m charged a 25.00 to close out my account that was recently transferred to your firm.I tried several times to get on the site to close it out and unable to do so,Then called to talk with someone and was disconnected 3x. Actually you should not be deducting anything from me. I am new to your company and didn’t chose your firm.",1

My money was transferred from my…,"re; Robert Sundeen Millennium Trust account #1v73REF753679.  Please request Millennial Trust contact me at 1847-927-3100 regarding the reason for my calls placed today. Extremely important.Called the 630-386-5600 twice today.  This morning, first time calling was on hold listening to your sales pitch for around 30 minutes.  Then I chose to leave a voicemail then was told I would get a call back.  That never happened.So I called back at 3 PM CST, 4 EST.  Once again, I am on hold so far for 40 minutes, then requested a call back. That is terrible service.  I need to speak only with a person who issues the 1099-R for account holders.   I received, incorrectly,, a 1099-R showing $136,067.50 a distribution for tax reporting.  When in fact no $ funds where distributed in that amount.  I simply had Cytometix issue a stock certificate equal to the number of shares of Cytometix stock that Millennium Trust had been holding in my account.  So no transaction took place.  Once Cytometix company advised Millennium Trust that that had issued a stock certificate to me, my account was then closed. I need Millennium Trust tax / accounting department to send a new ""corrected"" or reverse the 1099-R for no distribution of funds took place.  Instead at my request, Cytometix company contacted Millennial Trust to let it know that they were issuing a stock certificate for the amount of my share holding.   So no 1099-R is required since no transaction or funds distribution took place through Millennium Trust.   I am holding the stock certificate that was issued by Cytometix.  Unfortunately there is no market for selling my shares, which make them actually worthless.I did also receive 1099-R for cash, $236.36, that was in my Millennial Account.  When I closed my account Millennium Trust sent me a check for   $236.36.  The 1099-R is correct.",1

What you failed to acknowledge is how ridiculously high the fees are in comparison to other companies.  Not to mention how difficult you make it to request a disbursement.  We did not choose you...our previous employer did.  Thus, the ""benefit"" was to you for being able to bleed your clients account with such high fees.
