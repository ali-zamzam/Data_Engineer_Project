Don't hesitate ...,"This is my first experience with Lendio and I was fortunate to speak with Jill (JC) Chambers and she was very transparent and assuring that whatever the situation is she would assist me. Ms Jill was very knowledgeable about the matter and how to resolve it. Before I spoke with Jill I was ready to terminate the deal due another company in which I delt with, however from this point moving forward I choose Lendio. I didn't have to submit 50 documents and a note from my Mom to get the deal done. If you are looking for a solid and upfront company give Lendio a chance. I also hope that whomever you speak with or deal with I'm sure that you will have that Jill experience that I had.",5

This is my second time working with…,I worked with Mitch and Brooxie at Lendio to start the ball rolling on a nice sized SBA loan to help grow our small business. IMHO an SBA loan is the way to go; it may take a little more time than other types of loan but the rate is lower and term is longer (therefore the monthly payment lower). Mitch and Brooxie made the entire process super easy. The SBA asks for a decent amount of paperwork but Brooxie kept us on track and we never felt overwhelmed. We got our loan! Thank you guys!,5

I was a little skeptical at first as I have never applied for a business line of credit before.  This by far was the best decision I made. The application process was smooth and the system was user friendly allowing me to upload any requested documents.  I was assigned a consultant and Drew was professional and proficient with ensuring my loan was approved from start to finish. I think it took longer for me to get him the requested additional documents than it took him to submit and get me approved.  Once approved,  Drew made sure, I understood what would occur next and actually called me to walk me through step by step. I'm actually shocked to receive the funds so quickly.  It happened at a time when I desperately needed the funds to assist with growing the business. I am truly Thankful.",5

I clicked the link on the email to complete my online application, which was pretty quick and painless, and within a few minutes I got an email from Braxton who would be my POC at Lendio.  I explained my business, not many people understand what we do, and he was able to set me up with a loan that blew away all expectations.  Not only that, but the entire process concluded in 3 days.  Braxton was there the entire time liaising with the possible entities that might be a good fit for us.  I literally did nothing outside of send a few emails and talk on the phone.  The advice Braxton gave was both timely and accurate.  We could've closed earlier but he thought we could get a better deal if we sent in a few more pieces of information.  What more can I say, I clicked a button on an email and 3 days later got funded at almost 100% more that I thought we could get.  All thanks to Braxton at Lendio.  I know for an absolute fact that if I had gone to the lender directly that I would not have received as much.  If you are on the fence about Lendio, do yourself a favor, and just click the button to get started.  You won't be sorry.",5

Excellent service,"Working with Lendio was simple, fast and straightforward. I appreciate the kindness I received from Brooxie and their team.",5
I worked with John Mastellone; he killed it,"I never thought I would be so eager to write a review for a financing company. My experience in the past with this industry has been trending negative, and I had honestly set my expectations very low due to this when I started working with Lendio. Man, was I wrong! From the first moment that I engaged with Rocky, he was spot on with all the information he gave me, extremely professional and totally willing to work with me to get me the funding I needed. I was getting constant updates from him as to what was landing on his desk for my file, and he was fundamental in helping me make the right decision for my business when it came to deciding which offer to take. If Rocky was the only bright star shining in that organization, they would be doing very well, but then came Natalie and Brooxie, and they just completed this powerhouse of a team! Both of them came in the latter stages due to their SBA expertise, and boy did they deliver! Between the three of them, we got my file perfectly ready to submit for approval and funding, and everything went through without a hitch thanks to their efforts! I have no doubt in my mind that all three of them are some of the best people in this industry, and this entire experience has made me a Lendio client for life! When I pay this loan off, I will send Rocky an email directly to find out about other loan options, and I hope Natalie and Brooxie can get involved too so we can have the greatest chance at the stellar results that were achieved this time around. I know this review is long, but they deserve every word of it, and I'm still shorting them on praise! Thank you Rocky, thank you Natalie, thank you Brooxie, you guys are amazing!",5

He communicated clearly, took the time to understand our needs, probed to ensure he understood our urgency and then went above and beyond to assist us.

ATTENTION:  read everything and dont rely on a Lendio rep to tell the truth, THEY DONT.  they're brokers pushing you into products they either dont know about, and dont care about the outcome  - or your well being after you sign.  there are other, more honest and transparent, brokers out there.

Great professional and courtesy…,"During 2020 our coffee/wine bar struggled and barely kept the doors open just like the majority of smaller businesses in same sector.  Restaurants and Hospitality were completely left fend for themselves financially.  Like most of you, we decided to leverage our own personal credit and savings to keep the operation afloat based on the premise that the EIDL and PPP loans would help recoup expenses and justify never closing during shutdowns risking health and finances.  After a year and a half of ""being in a queue"", we were informed that ""EIDL funds had run out and seek local assistance"".  I reached out to Lendio for loans and and advice and within 4hrs, Michael had me in contact with a lender and were funded within 24hrs.  Its not the exact vehicle were searching for but its the right vehicle for the next step for building a relationship and getting to the next level.  We are able to now purchase much needed small wares, equipment and inventory to expand our wine operation and recoup some high interest debt that we had personally guaranteed.

After that, I never received PPP money. When I tried to get in contact with Lendio, they never responded, there was no direct number to call. By the time I reached out to the SBA and my accountant, they both said the approval code didn’t mean anything and at that point us was too late to apply for PPP again.

My loan officer disappeared on me… wasn’t answering calls or e mails when we were needing to close the deal Finally some else called and said they would get it taken care of. This was a Friday. Told them I had scheduled delivery the following Tuesday and was promised it would be done. Tuesday came and myself and the equipment company were doing all we could to close the deal and were ignored. No calls or e mails returned.  Then I randomly got an e mail with a contract and nothing else. The day I was supposed to get delivery, I had staff come cover me ($180 in wages) to be able to get this delivery and because lendio didn’t have their ducks in a row, I now have to do the same thing this Friday now that we finally got it take care of a week later!  On top of that…. It was NEVER disclosed to me or even mentioned that I’d have to pay $1400 at closing of the deal! Talk about STRESSFUL SITUATION made worse!!! A heads up or something would have been nice. But instead… late ln being able to get delivery, already been waiting around and don’t have time to apply and go through another company when I FINALLY had this contract and needed my equipment last week’ so have no choice but to sign and agree and pay $1400 with no notice that leaves me incredibly tight!No communication! Deceptive lending! And a total pain! And that’s all within the first month of dealing with Lendio. I’m not optimistic on how the rest of this business relationship will be. This issue will be reported to FTC and BBB and any further issues will also be reported.",5

He assured me that he will try his hardest fastest to get me what I need. I was really skeptical about this whole thing. But after talking to him, I let him do his thing, and in no time at all he had a lender. He answered all my text messages, he answered all my phone calls, and he kept me in the loop of what was happening. The next day I signed the paperwork, the next day after that I received the money in the bank.. It was incredible. Dam, was a nice guy too, he answered all my questions he calmed on my nerves, he told me not to worry about anything that he'll get it done and he did.

It all stopped. I approached my bank, Wells Fargo about a PPP loan. Wells was completely unresponsive. After a month or so of waiting for Wells to get it together I began to look for other ways to apply for the PPP loan. I visited several local banks with no luck. My next effort was the online banks, Kabbage, etc. No luck here either. A friend of mine suggested Lendio. I applied online immediately. Within a few minutes I had text from a gentlemen named Frank Tomasula. I had made some mistakes on the application. Frank schooled me how to correct the application. He was in constant contact throughout the entire process. Finally after 3-4 weeks the phone rings. It's Frank. I have been approved. He was emotional. He knew what he was doing for people. Helping during a time of need. I would not have received the loan without him. I'm certain my friend that recommended Lendio feels EXACTLY THE SAME WAY! Frank was his contact at Lendio as well.

I have literally reached out and tried everything prior to calling Lendio to get a loan or business cards or a line of credit and was turned down repeatedly for not being open for two years. My husband and I literally have blood, sweat and tears in this business start up. We did our own renovations and gave everything we had into the business.Although the hard work was paying off as we got busy, the business grew faster than anticipated and the overhead costs became a little bit of a struggle. We had to hire an employee and needed more funds for payroll, inventory and machine costs. Looking for a quick solution, I called Lendio and spoke with Darnell who was the kindest soul on the other end of the phone and I could tell he did everything he could to make this happen for us and he found lenders for us right away!The approval and line of credit came exactly at the right time, with speed and they were very responsive. All of this was wrapped in 3 days! Impeccable response time! Lendio has helped save small business owners to allow us to continue to do what we love!

Tylere Jackson is the best,"Lendio seemed nice enough until on Feb 23 2022 an agent let me know that the 5% interest rate amortizes monthly not annually. That’s essentially the equivalent of a 40% interest rate! I’m much better off using a credit card. I was glad that he warned me, so I told him to cancel the funding which he assured me was the case on a recorded call. Just yesterday March 8th I got a congratulatory email on my new credit line. Sure enough it wasn’t cancelled out like they told me on recording. I’ve reached out multiple times via call and email, but nothing but crickets from them. Be warned! Only leaving this review because they just sent me an email with this link asking me to leave a review, and have yet to actually address my concern.",5

Amazing,"Lendio acquired an accounting product (now called Sunrise) and are now forcing early adopters to pay monthly for a product they already purchased a lifetime license to. It would be fine to charge for new features, but they are forcing users to pay for already existing features (e.g. you can't modify your existing invoice templates without paying again).I'm sure this is legal and all, but it's not a nice way to treat customers—especially early adopters... 👎",5

Grateful!,"Overall we are happy with our experience with Lendio. The initial screening process and document upload interface was easy to use. Jose who was our primary contact was very responsive in reaching out and answering questions. What I believe could be improved in the process is concise but informative breakdown of loan options during the process. What types, how they work and expected interest rate ranges. Our initial discussions regarding loans were disheartening to us as the loan rates were not presented as annual interest rates, but rather the total cost, leaving us to do the math for ourselves. Further the initial loan offers came with incredibly high interest rates. In the end we found a loan with a rate that worked for us. I think that with a clear and concise spreadsheet of loan options before us, that loan my have been found more quickly and easily.",5
I just wanna thank you to Lendio,Great service. Kept me up on the latest progress.,5

Positive review,"My experience with Lendio was very positive and stress-free, and I feel fortunate that I decided to go with Lendio. (I received several follow up calls and emails from a number of lenders after I filled out an application with sba.gov.) My funding manager/contact at Lendio was Rechele Brooke who was knowledgeable, supportive, very personable, patient, and attentive. Rechele also emailed and called like the other lenders, but what stood out was her voicemail was professional, authentic and warm, so I decided to return her call. I appreciated her calm, professional and warm demeanor, and I was pleasantly surprised that a phone call with a lender can be so comfortable. I spoke with Rechele at Lendio on 2/22, and by 2/24 I was funded. I had frozen my credit for protection and if I did not have to unfreeze, my funding may have happened even sooner. Rechele answered all my questions patiently and she was great about following up promptly either by phone or email. Upon asking, I also appreciated her explanations about which lenders gave me offers and her sharing feedback of what the lenders liked about my business and its financial results/profile. It was gratifying to hear this kind of feedback. I was informed that the lender who I went with was impressed with my financial results and the fact that my bank statements showed consistent cash inflows and no overdrafts.It was my first time applying for a line of credit for my relatively new business (although my book of business is not new as I have decades of professional experience in my field and built my client base over the years) and I could not have asked for a better first-time outcome and experience. My long-time bank required a minimum of 3 years in business so I'm grateful to Lendio and kudos to them for having someone like Rechele Brooke on their team.",5

Great job Zack was awesome.,So where do I begin Enzo David reached out to me last year to see if I still needed help he had reached out to me during covid to see how the business was doing and at that time we were in the middle of the sba loan process which didnt help our business at all.I have to say I was very discouraged at that point cause we still needed financial help Enzo David started to reach back out to me in December and I finally got back to him in January and we finally started this process in February. I want to commend Enzo David for being diligent and staying committed to helping me it has been very frustrating to deal with different lenders that have denied me for any loan amount. So in closing thank you to Lendio for giving me a chance and to Enzo dude no words can describe how happy you have made me and the light at the end of the tunnel is shining very brightly thank you Lendio Funding and Enzo David.,5

Tyler Miller is a great lender who is very helpful and friendly.,"I've been through various aspects of the Lendio experience five times now. This is the second time I'm writing such a review; the first time, last summer, they requested a chance to change my mind. After my follow-up experiences, this review is going to be worse. In summary, Lendio is phenomenal at selling nasty lines of credit at usurious rates, and terrible at providing you with something you might actually want...in my case, an SBA loan.My very first contact/loan officer at Lendio was Johnny-on-the-spot. He did things like texting to let me know he was stepping out to lunch, but if I happened to send any docs over in the meantime, he'd look at them as soon as he got back and would call me. Y'know, above-and-beyond stuff. He was also very friendly and knowledgeable. I wound up signing up for a $60,000 LOC with amortized, one-year payback on the draws, which is cool, except the rate is (seriously) higher than any of my credit cards. And they pull a 3% fee out of every draw, so even if you pay it back the next day, you've already eaten a sizable piece. Fair's fair; I mean, I could take it or leave it. I took it, very hesitantly. Just in case, y'know?To date, I've taken three draws totaling $20k, and paid them all back as quickly as I could. One could argue that Lendio did me a service, because taking the money was obviously less painful than not taking it. That's a valid argument...maybe they were a net positive in my life. But barely. And for all the effort, they should have netted out a lot more positive. I'm really not sure what kind of financing most businesses are used to getting, but in my experience, this sort of thing doesn't belong in America. Unless you're a terrible borrower. Which I'm not.K, so asking about someone's offerings and finding out they suck isn't all that bad, but what came next is what inspired me to write–twice. The thing is, as I mentioned, I went to Lendio in the first place because they plug SBA loans on their website. The SBA specialist I was assigned after the LOC was in place repeatedly dropped the ball on my case, basically ignoring me for months. I eventually wrote a TrustPilot review kinda like this one, and was getting some urgent, kid glove treatment within about thirty seconds of posting. I was re-delegated to a different loan officer, who came off with a song and dance to behold. Gauging the quality of THAT relationship took some time, because gathering up all the docs the SBA requires can take some doing. Those poor loan officers wait on us like sailors' widows! But I always tried to set expectations about how long something would take me or my CPA to sort out, and then reciprocated with what I felt was an ample amount of objective patience once I'd done my homework. I mean, it's really not cool to drag your heels for months and then be like ""K, here it is, I want answers yesterday!"" So I didn't. Well, once I'd done all my stuff, the loan officer became entirely unhelpful. They ended with ""sorry, you don't have enough income for the SBA"". My CPA says ""Look at the damn return, it shows $52k in book income. That's over 10% of gross, how much net does the SBA want to see?"" to which the LO essentially replies ""The SBA doesn't make those numbers known, please try again next year."" When we asked things like ""What sort of nets and ratios have you seen get approved, and in all your vast experience as a Lendio loan officer who specializes in the SBA, where have you kinda sorta seen the threshold to be, 'cause I don't have to take all these write-offs"" we get totally ghosted. It's been months.Here's the rub. During all that time I was rummaging down this SBA rabbit hole, I was getting calls from other Lendiots saying things like ""Hey, your numbers are looking really good, why don't I shop around for something even better for you?"" Twice, I assented. Both times, after the back and forth, they're like ""Wow, that LOC you've already got, yeah, the one with the 30% interest rate, that seems to be the best thing we have!"" The other crap they were throwing out there, well, I probably couldn't do better going to Rico the payday lender across the tracks, but it wouldn't be far off.So in my summation, Lendio probably doesn't even do SBA loans, they probably just have someone there to string you along for months while other bozos try and hook you on subprime crap. I do gotta say, the initial application is fairly slick, and the brand and people are all so friendly and aw-shucksy and full of Utah, it's very disarming. But their actual products are a joke, and I think there's some smoke and mirrors going on. Funny, I knew Lendio’s founder in college, and I've watched his career with a fair amount of admiration. But now I think he's more along the lines of one of these broey titans of pest control/home automation: rich, maybe, but very minimal contribution to humanity.",5

Thank you so much for helping me building my company’s credit.",5
One of the best companies,"I am the owner of Puptown Charlotte, a dog daycare and boarding facility that experienced a drastic drop in revenue at the beginning of the Covid 19 pandemic.  At that time, countless loan marketplaces and banks ignored my PPP application, but Lendio moved quickly to answer my questions, process my application and match me with Ready Capital.  I was given a direct email and phone number to a Lendio employee, so it was easy to communicate with the company (a pleasant change from other places which offered only generic 800 numbers, where I was placed on hold for hours at a time).Lendio helped me secure one of the first round PPP loans on the day that funding was depleted, and over the next few months posted a series of helpful videos to instruct about treasury guidance and forgiveness applications.  Through the whole process I genuinely felt that Lendio cared about me as a person and was invested in the survival and success of my small business - I am grateful for their help and will return if I need to apply for other funding sources in the future.",5

When I didn't understand some things during the application process, Kade reached out to Justin in another department who took time and patients to help me understand everything before signing. Justin didn't stop working with me until he was sure I fully understood everything I needed for this loan.  He even provided excellent advice on what to do to keep me from running into the same issues in the future if I needed funding.

Lace was AMAZING,"This app worked as described. Our lender , Cache Valley Bank was very responsive. Lendio not so much.  Because we didnt hear back on any progress we were forced to pursue our options through other lenders. This caused much wasted time and resources for us and the other lenders.

Great experience,Taylor DeNatalie was awesome! Talk about customer service! She really make you feel really important!,5
Great service and quick turnaround,"Company needs major improvement in their manual loan processing protocols.While it is true the company assisted in both rounds of PPP, it was definitely not a smooth or easy process. Getting my loans approved required over 15 trouble tickets, escalation to corporate level individuals, waiting for days for a response that did not solve or even address the issue,, contacting the direct lender myself, contacting the SBA, pointing out critical errors, demanding the critical errors be corrected, and regular follow up. It was VERY VERY VERY stressful and not what one would expect when employing a loan SERVICER. In the end I ended up working with the direct lender and servicing my own loan. I would only return to lendio out of pure desperation.",5
Excellent customer service and quick funding,I would give zero stars if I could. Nobody knows anything. I bounced around a million times. I messaged the CMO then the CEO who said I wouldn’t get my PPP money because the underwriting bank ran out of funds. Two weeks later after dealing with the bank directly - I got my money. Dumb people who don’t care. Terrible combination.,5
Brandi was very kind and helped…,I would like to thank Lindio for the professional and swift service they provided me and my company.

Thank you guys.",5
Michael Greenaway,"Morgan was very efficient, answer professionally all my questions",5
Excellent customer service and quick…,I have dealt with Steven Vasquez in the past.  He is a totally honest hard working person who explained the entire details of the MCA we received.  He compared the various options offered to us and gave us an honest opinion as to which offer was best for us.  Lendio has so many relationships with lenders that there is always a chance to get an offer.  I would never hesitate to work with Lendio again and especially with Mr. Vasquez!!,5

Thank you Bobby Wall and Lendio for…,Lendio was clueless to the knowledge of what was happen with my loan. In fact I was told I was not approved and was not getting funded. I think some of the representatives were ok but overall worst company— I should’ve been funded months ago.,5
Had the pleasure of speaking with Deborah Stevenson!,This was explained multiple times to Lendio and Texas National Bank. There are two schedule C filed for 2020. One for my wife and one for myself. My wife started her business in late 2020. The amount request was from my wife's schedule C. Not only was this for a smaller amount but I am sure that it was not legal to submit her schedule C for a PPP grant. Can someone please explain to me why underwriting for this application was incorrectly done? Both at Lendio and at Texas National bank.,5
Great customer service and quick!,"The process was a bit grueling and tedious. It seemed as if the funding was NEVER going to come through. It actually did come through after some persistence and follow through on my Lendio Support team! They were 5-star all the way and kept me well informed of the process. There were times I was ready to throw in the towel, but my Lendio team did a great job at explaining the process. I really had NO IDEA the mountain of paperwork that funders are buried beneath - hence why the process took so long. AGAIN, THANK YOU to my Lendio team who kept me ""in the know"" so as not to loose my faith that the necessary funding was forthcoming. It COULD NOT have come at a better time!",5

Very nice company,"Lendio was very helpful in the beginning.Helped me and was patient with me when I wasn't sure what paperwork I would need to move forward to my goal which was getting my small business back up and running.I lost my wife to cov 19 she was my book keeper.It cost me 12,000 to bury her so I thought my loan would help me. I waited 5 months for only $2,000 honestly my loan put me further in debt because I was told one price and at the end I got not even half so I spent some money and took a few gambles I wouldn't have if I would have known the true figure I was going to receive. But I was taught to be greatful for what you get.In times like these.But now I am in worst debt then before.",5
Amazing group my agent Taylor went…,Applied for a PPP loan in January of 2021 and finally received some money the first week of July 2021.

Lendio made it easy to connect with the…,"These guys was very helpful and professional in there service, greatly appreciated!!!",5
Great attention to my business needs,"Using Lendio was truly a terrible experience.The website and user interface is awful, but the customer service really takes the prize for one of the worst things I've experience in a pretty long time. Many many times after I had completed the application, they would just send an email (along with a simultaneous text and automated phone call) with a list of documents (I assume they were requesting I send those documents to them, but can't say for sure). Literally that's all the email would say - no greeting, no instructions, no context. Not to mention that these were always documents that I had already provided. And then when I would respond with a question, they would just with the exact same message as before - so it was either a robot or I just wasn't important to enough to deserve the time it takes to write full sentences. Also, I was approved for a PPP loan amount and then they later came back and said they were revising the amount and reduced down to about 10% of the original approved amount. So yeah, I don't have much to say that's positive.",5

Great service,"Lendio was not getting the loan done. Luckily the actual bank that was doing the loan called us and we were able to get it done in spite of Lendio.

They DID NOT put us in touch with the bank, the bank called us when we were almost past the deadline, thank God for the bank. Lendio not so much we almost lost our money.",5

The representative, Chase Hendrickson, made sure all of my questions were answered. He talked borrowing strategies and how to solve for my holiday buying strategy.",5
Exceptional Experience,"Lendio was a massive piece of QUEEF during the entire process of applying for PPP 1st and 2nd draws. No customer service, extremely sketchy ""application managers"" that switched without any notice all the time, never answered phones or email outreach and generally acted incredibly rude or idiotic. The PPP program was supposed to help people in need. Lendio is the dictionary definitive example of a scummy middle man entity that's mother should have swallowed it.",5
Experience was great and helpful,"Truly was a bless to receive the financial assist , its helped!",5
Great service from Morgan,Disappointed with Lendio. Took MONTHS to get funded. Communication was horrible. Numerous unanswered phone calls and texts. Very frustrating experience.,5

Loved my experience with Lendio,Great help! Really need it and it came threw.,5
Straight to the point on the paperwork…,"Thru my research, I discovered Lendio as the best rated loan company for small business loans, particularly the PPP loans. My experience is exactly that. My loan manager, Te'aira Jones was always in communication with me and helpful with every step of the process. She contacted me to alert me if anything was needed from me, and swiftly submitted it via her designated telephone or email. The only reason why I received my second PPP loan was because of her alerting me of a looming deadline, and within one day the loan application and all requirements were completed because of Te'Aira. Lendio has an enormous network of lenders, and great technology to integrate their services and communication, keeping my informed by my login Lendio website every step of the way. Bravo Lendio. Bravo Ms Jones.",3
Great service,"I gave it three stars because they finally got me the loan.  However, the whole process was lacking.  Communication was nonexistent and it took over four months to fund.  During the process, they changed account manager's on me five times.  None of my emails were answered and they can't be reached by phone.  Two months into the process, they told me that the loan was funded only to rescind two days later, then nothing...",5

"Hi Lawrence,",Loan officers or Loan managers are persistent to get your loan but once you’re on the que they don’t know how to return your inquiry. They just want the numbers that they were able to include you in their roster…….. a rat race so to speak.These officers don’t listen to you!!!,5
These guys helped me pretty quick with…,Good communication through the process gave me satisfaction. Good experience with Lendio.,5
Very professional,Lendio were great throughout the entire process...,5
Lendio has delivered for our business…,It took a while but the loan went through.,5
Excellent Loan process,It was great working with Lenido. They walked me through the process and explained everything to me to make things go smoothly. Whenever I needed to get in contact with someone they would get back to me right away and answer my questions. I highly recommend Lenido!,5
very helpful,"Great experience, good follow-up!",5
Appreciate your help,"Great customer service, Mariah Sevey was very helpful and courteous!!",5
Fast and easy,"Not only did the person assigned to my application keep changing, but the bank that was supposed to be handling the application also changed. To add insult to injury by the third counselor, they were telling me that I no longer qualified to receive the help with the ppp program that I was using them for. Mainly because it took them so long to get to my application that a new tax season had passed, and they said I no longer qualified and we're not able to help me anymore. Luckily the new bank reached out to me personally and got me my money within a week after 6 months of running around with Lendio. Then two weeks after I've already received my money straight from the bank, I get an email asking ME if I had any news about the PPP application, despite the fact they said I no longer qualified and they couldn't help me.",5
Lendio is awesome,"The process of applying was smooth and easy to document. However, once the documentation was filed, it was impossible to get any specific responses from a live human being. A person was assigned to me, but I could not get their attention. Then, at one point, I was told via email that my 2nd draw loan had been submitted too late and would not be funded. Then, weeks later, an underwriter from SBA requested more info and then told me that my application had arrived on time and was being processed. I eventually received the funding just recently,Finally, I've been unable to get clear direction from Lendio about how to apply for forgiveness. My specific questions were never addressed, but I did get a general form answer.",5
quick and easy process,Lendio guided my business through a difficult time and process. The team saw us through until we received our loan. Highly recommend LENDIO.,5
They were easy to work with,The process was very long and very confusing. I do not feel like I was kept up-to-date and I was getting messages from so many different people that I was concerned of legitimacy. I had to send things several times. But in the end I got my loan so I’m satisfied,4
Morgan L,I appreciate all that Lendio did for me in securing a PPP Loan.  I was a little overwhelmed by the paper work but they stuck with me and guided me through.,5

Bennett was awesome to work with,My go to for all my business needs. They’ve helped me through the pandemic and beyond. Thank you guys so much for all your help.,5
Professional Service,"I contacted Lendio because I needed a loan due to some late payments by clients. They offered to help but I didn't realize that they were going to connect me with a predatory lending company called Capital Expansion Group. The Lendio rep (Anthony) explained the loan but I believe he purposefully left out information to make it seem better than it was. It turned out that regardless of when I pay off the loan I still owed a huge fee. He didn't tell me how much this fee was. Be very careful with Lendio and have your lawyer review the contracts because after this horrible experience I talked to my lawyer and he said ""That is a classic predatory lending company.""",5
Quick service low daily payment is…,Great communication with this company. They responded to all my questions and concerns. Very helpful in my time of need . Thanks Lendio!!!,5
Thank you great people with great work,Thank you Lendio for all of your help. You constantly followed up and were always available for my questions. Grateful for your service!,5
Excellent service,"Jeremiah has been absolutely wonderful throughout the entire loan process. Completely transparent and honest about what Lendio can provide, answering questions promptly and professionally and guiding us through every step. This is the beginning of an excellent working relationship with Lendio and Jeremiah is truly a huge asset to the company.",5
My experience with Lemdio is unmatched,"Do not use Lendio for PPP, they will pass you around to (no kidding) 8 different lending managers (none of which communicated with the previous one), wait until the last minute to get you funding. Tell you that you are funded, then go back and say you missed paperwork which is already in the system, then tell you that you have missed the deadline for funding, AFTER the bank has directly notified you that you will receive funding. Totally unorganized, no real accountability. The fact we were able to get funded was a mere dice roll.",5
Good place to pick up quick hassle free…,It was easy to work with you guys but I haven’t received the SBA loan in the bank yet. Any trouble s potentially on either end?,5
Fast and easy,Awesome service and helped all along the way.,5

We were attempting to complete the PPP…,"Lendio made my growth to be easy by letting me worry about innovation rather than where to get funds from! The experience is like non other as we are now on our prime already within weeks of getting funded by you guys within 24 hour window! You have found yourself a lifetime customer. Thanks again and I recommend other business owners to just pick up the phone and talk to their representatives, I promise you won’t look back again! Sincerely,Move 4 Less",5
so nice to work with Avery,"We have been going back and forth tirelessly with their PPP internal services team to resolve a loan forgiveness application since October of 2020. We consistently are met with mixed signals and incorrect sufficient information to provide. the customer representative is not giving me information that is in line with the formal guidance of the programs, nor has she ever cited guidance that is holding us up.  We are continuously told the information will not suffice and cannot seem to get around them. they refuse to send the information to the SBA and do not provide clear details on how to. I have work with dozens of banks and have gotten over $25million forgiven and this is the only bank I have had issues getting through to.",5

He was amiable, interested and most importantly tenacious.  He had no problems going back to lenders and pushing for the loan modifications that i wanted.  He truly represented my interests and brought back options and alternatives for me to consider.  If you want someone to work hard for your business financing I would highly recommend Nicholas.  Great customer service and exceptional follow through is what you can expect from Nicholas.",5

Great customer service,"The Associates went above and beyond to assist me with the process, any questions I had were answered with a quick response and not your normal email response in which takes up to 3-5 days but a personal call response from the client so that they may answer any and all questions that you may have. They also walk you through the process giving you the knowledge, time as well as patients that I can personally say I needed. I felt welcomed during my office meeting & was given insight as well as offered classes & assistance throughout my journey not just during the loan process. For these reasons & more I give Lendio a 5 star rating. Thank you for all the time, the help, the calls & one on one assistance given.",5

Smooth loan,"After having lack of experience and being turned from other companies, Lendio made it happen without any hassle.",5
On time and when I needed it!,Who doesn’t know LENDIO is greatest company in the world.,5
Súper easy to work with,I told them several times to check their records as I don't remember signing any documents with them. I did apply with Le dio but I was funded by a different lender several months ago. I never heard anything from Le dio until now telling me to watch my bank account. I never signed any agreements with Le dio an d I told them to double check in case of fraud. No money has landed in my account either which alarms me.,5
EASY AND GREAT COMMUNICATION,.. so this review is more about ready capita.. horrible!! first off i been dealing with them since april was approved early may... took them a month to send closing docs... then in june my bank rejected the deposit... it took me 3 weeks to get them to respond to me yet the portal saod funded... then i spoke to a rep who told me i needed to send new banking info.. so i did... now the whole time the portal stated i was funded... well i got an email from someone saying they were canceling my loan but still it was funded... well now you cant check the portal but on sba site its approved un disbursed... i cant get anybody to respond to me i knoe they have the correct bsnk info now yet they hsvent made 1 attemot to deposit my funds to this day hopefully soon!!! now i will change to 5 stars once my issue gets resolved... i spoke with lendio today and heidi was amazing and if she gets my mess of an experience resolved and funds in my hraccount i will gladly change to 5 stars .. but they are a team with ready capital so what happens with ready cap.. reflects on lendio!!,5

The application was simple and their communication was excellent.If you are looking for a loan or Line of Credit without going through the traditional bank process look to Lendio next time.,5
Lendio helped us get something just right for us,There was so much miscommunication between the lender and Lendio that I had to sign 4 contracts after I was approved the funding!  it took 4.5 months and legal action to get Lendio to close the loop to get the funding!,5
Lendio assisted me in getting a small…,It was a pleasure working with the professionals of Lendio.  Received both PP loans 1st round and 2nd round because of their get it done attitude.,5
Lendio surprised me!!!applied from my…,"Working with Lendio was wonderful.  This entire group has their ""ducks in a row"".  They operate efficiently, quickly and you're treated as a person, not a number in the production line.  I was honestly surprised that they found the amount of time to devote such personal attention to each client.  It was reassuring, comforting, beyond helpful and their assistance saved my business which is much more than I can say for any local lender.  Locally every lender was more interested in serving their largest clients first which left the little guy like me out in the cold.  Lendio treated me incredibly well and I will hope to do business with them in the future and would highly recommend Lendio to any borrower.",5
Excellent experience,"First of all I NEVER received my funds and they tried to escape funds and then told me I was denied after I provided all my information. I am very upset because I gave my personal information to them and no one called just sent me a denial. Your staff was not communicating and it was Never deposited in my account. I would NOT refer anyone to use this company.I can call.my bank but no one called and asked me anything. There is no deposit can someone call me to verify my account the funds are not there. I spoke to my bank there are no pending deposits. Someone from lendio has dropped in wrong account.It is August 5th, 2021 and I still haven't heard from.anyone at Lendio. I called my bank no pending transactions. No communication whatsoever. I also went back on my Lendio app and they erased file showing disbursement but NOT in my account. With no one contacting me from Lendio. I know they messed up and I am pissed because someone should call and find my funds. I contacted SBA as well and they said they only speak to lender. I am going to make sure everyone knows not to use this company. They steal it from right under your nose. Not happy a customer. This is ridiculous and I'm about to lose my business too...I want an investigation started asap on Lendio and the person they put money in wrong account because they could've reported it.",5
The experience was very pleasant,Lendio has been great to work with.  Always responsive and helpful.,5
My experience was overall very good,Excellent service for my business.  Attentive and expedient.,4

"Fast, easy and well worth it!","I (customersupport (@) livingthatlavishlifestyle.onMicrosoft.com) can honestly say, at first I wasn’t sure about Lendio, it just seemed like I was being taking through a lot of loops? However, I will say I WAS WRONG about them, they got my company funded (PPP) and even helped with a second draw, I couldn’t be any more relieved! Our company like most has struggled through the pandemic and I had exhausted all my resources. Lendio even offered to connect me with a Lender for funding, while waiting for the funds to be disbursed. Some great folks over at Lendio, I GIVE THEM 5 (million) starz!

I have a small new company..,"One of the worst experiences I've ever had with a lending organization. I applied for my PPP loan through Lendio back in March, when finally it moved to the final phase (after I received an SBA loan number) they were absolutely impossible to get ahold of through email, phone, or their online chat. I would leave countless voicemails with multiple representatives, and leave emails, and after 5 business days of attempting to talk to a rep, they would come back with some additional document they would need that I would then get to them in under 24 hours, just for them to vanish again. This happened 4-5 times in a row until the lender rejected the SBA loan due to not receiving the documents from them in a timely manner, and its been weeks now and one of the representatives still haven't even responded to my last slew of voicemails/emails to let me know the loan was rejected, I had to log into their ""portal"" to find out.",5

Everyone I talked to was above and beyond helpful, I also talked to the same few people while my application was being processed which makes all the difference. I came here to apply for the PPP loan and the only negative was that it took several months to submit my application. It might have been that my situation was a bit confusing, but it seemed like it got stuck and lost in limbo for quite a while and we almost missed the deadline. Likewise, my husbands PPP never got submitted because I think the same situation. I know the PPP stuff was crazy, so I still would say I had a great experience and I would definitely work with them again!",5

Lendio Support Team Went ABOVE and BEYOND Expectations,First round experience for the PPP was amazing.

Lendio'service was excellent,"The process of entering the PPP applications was widely different with each company,  made worse because of the overwhelming amount of applications. So many people applied that most companies did not answer the phone or email and their systems could not handle the volume.  Lendio from the beginning was a simple process, with help along the way in telephone and chats to complete applications. Calls back and emails to expedite missing items or additional items requested by lenders.   Until the last application, they were professional, courteous and cared very much about helping the application get processed for funding.  I consider their level of service 5 star and their level of performance consistent until process completed.  Their security system was refreshingly. secure   Each time... it questioned the logins if it did not come from the application IP or telephone contact.",5

Stay away!",5
The service Lendio provided was…,Fast and great service,5
The process for my business was…,"I am utterly and completely disappointed in the service. Throughout my four (4) week loan process I had no less than three (3) different representatives assigned my my loan. None of them reached out to let me know the status. None of them explained that they were handing the file to someone else. I only found out of the changes because I regularly logged in to check the status. I spoke to one representative at the beginning of the loan process and she acted as if I was bothering her, giving me one word answers. I sent multiple emails and phone calls to each of them. At no point did they return a call, or respond to emails. While I am understanding that the past few months must have been extremely busy. Every business is a people business. I know all too well the importance of communication and general courtesy. Of which I received non through the entire loan process.Note: your reply is a lie. I still have my portal access. I replied to Trustpilot's request for proof. I forwarded multiple emails, chats screen shots, etc. No one from YOUR organization has responded or addressed my concerns. You are attempting to pass it off as if I was not a client.",5

Loans,"So glad I went through Lendio for my PPP loan!  Great communication with the people helping, they always let me know how things were going during the process. They were also very quick to respond to any questions I had. I would highly recommend!",5
Lendio good job,Everything went very smooth. Still waiting on getting the second disbursement.,5
Thanks a lot for the business loan,"Very confusing at the beginning, after I fill up the application they open two different accounts they say one a regular application and the other one was for the PPP loan, it was very confusing I also filled up the application at least 10 times before I got it close to right because when I choose an answer on the question it keeps changing after I sign out",5
Thank you Lendio,"They were extremely helpful in fulfilling my PPP loan, keeping me advised on every step of the way! A great company the whole way through.",5
I have a placentae experience whit…,"If it wasn’t for Lendio, i’m pretty sure that I would not be able to get this long. I am so grateful for them. For taking your time to walk me through the application being persistent on finding ways for me to get this one. Thank you for your time and hard work I am greatly appreciate it.",5
Best team ever 💪💪💪,"Hi Lendio.Thanks for the help. The timing was a little too long, but de made it. And this funding is very helpful in keeping my operations competitive, and recover part of my payroll expenses. Again, many thanks, and hope to get your support in processing my request for the forgiveness.Regards.",5
LENDIO Helped me so much in a time of…,They were very helpful and gave step by step instructions what to do and there you have it my loan was processed.,5
Lendio you’re absolutely the GREATEST,"I previously left a 1 star review.  I still can't leave a 5 star. Needless to say, all my 1 star reviews have been removed.  Dealt with the stress of Lendio for almost 6 months.  Finally got approved for 1st round PPP.  And I'm thankful for it.  But there was no communication during that time.  Noone that apparently ""worked for"" Lendio ever responded to questions,  & then when someone did, I was given the runaround & different answers from the different people.   Was passed off to about 20 different so called ""lenders"" before one finally gave me the PPP.  I'm giving 3 star because someone did finally help & I did recieve the funding.  I'm praying when I apply for forgiveness,  that it will not go the same way.",5
My go to for all my business needs,Great people god job thank you for helping us we really appreciate it five star,5
I contacted Lendio because I needed a…,The process was very easy. Everyone was very helpful. Thank you this really helped me at a time when I truly needed help.,1
Well worth the wait.,Insuficient updates and guidance throughout the process,5
Thank you Lendio for all of your help,The Lendio PPP loan application limited applicants to using 2019 or 2020 to calculate their second draw loan in 2021 and did not include the third option available under SBA/PPP rules of the 12-month period before the loan is issued.  Our organization would have been able to receive a larger loan (and those extra dollars would have really helped!) if Lendio had allowed that option on their application.  One technical recommendation: The upload options could also be improved to allow applicants to label and categorize each document -- that might have helped with the delays in the loan review process on the backend.,5
Jeremiah has been absolutely wonderful…,Excellent customer service And very good on follow ups. The process was very easy thank you,5
Do not use Lendio for PPP,"I was skeptical at first because i hadnt heard of lendio, but when i applied for the ppp loan, they had someone helping me every step of the way even though it was a last minute application. I ended up being approved and had the money in my account within 2 weeks!",1
Very attentive good job,Your customer service is by far under par. Nobody calls you to keep you informed not do they respond to messages in a proper time. Not a pleasant experience at all.,5
Honest an helpful,"I was being informed of the status of my application on regular basis by email and text message. Kate was very helpful and responsive to my requests. Overall, I believe that I've got exceptional customer servie.Thank you!",5
Good and effective,Lendio helped me with my 1st & 2nd PPP loans. They are by far the best.Great people to work with. They really took care of me and great communication!!!,5
It was easy to work with you guys but I…,The staff was amazing to serve me and I was very impressed by the staff and I will recommend us to Lendie,5
Awesome service and helped all along…,Unfortunately I wasn’t able to get a bigger loan due to my business being seasonal.  I messaged the person and left voice messages who first originally was helping with my loan but never replied back to adjust the loan.  Instead I just had to submit the loan amount which was almost 50% less than what I would have received if the adjuster or even the online platform was able to figure this issue out.   Can’t really complain about the PPP loan but the 2nd loan was considerably less than my first loan and there was nothing your company did about it.,5
They’re very professional and friendly,"This time is so fast , never thought I’ll get my 2nd ppp loan … all my friend didn’t get it .. u guys r the best and I’ll recommend it… thanks again",5

Way to go LendidoEdit after reply; I have two businesses and applied for the paycheck protection program in both. Lendido merged them together and only one of my businesses actually got funded. I guess my other business is just out of luck. Just like the pandemic, through no fault of my own, Lendido will make my business go under.",5
Highly recommended!!!!,"During the hard time of the COVID-19 pandemic, the only help for the small business come from Lendio in given the oxygen necessary for there survival.Thanks very much for Lendio",5
Very responsive and helpful.,"In the beginning I had many issues having any type of clear conversation or questions answered and had been transferred to multiple people. I had submitted my applications 3 months before I got any type of clear understanding to what else they needed. I had to continuously ask what was needed instead of Lendio updating me on extra information they would need. I was in limbo for a long time. At the end I reached someone that actually was quitting the next day, but he was the most helpful person I had dealt with. Finally a week before I got funding I spoke with a gentleman that actually communicated what was going on and got back with me right away with any questions. I’m only giving stars because of those two people and finally getting funding almost 6 months later.",5
A little hard at first but everything…,Great service and they follow up your case on time and they send nonfiction to customers regarding to their loan.,5

Learning curve,"Good morning, here's an update to my ppp loan through Lendio. As previously posted, I signed docs with TNB on 3rd of this month, PLP # in CAWEB since the 27th of last months. I have called TNB twice, first time was told its takes 10-20 after docs signed. Today was told the process takes 20-30 days. Not sure to why the process stretch's as days go by? Strange!",4

I love Lendio they help you with…,Superb experience. Got me my money with no hiccups. Thanks Lendio!,5
great follow up,"My name is Theresa Ellis. I am having some difficulties with receiving my PPP loan via Lendio. I had already executed my Loan Note Docs on 5/20 and today is 6/16 and I have yet to see any funds in my account. I have emailed my Lendio Funding Managers but NONE of them returned my emails. I then tried calling the Lender and again, heard nothing but crickets. Ive had to repeatedly submit certain documents to Lendio multiple times. Why? Probably because I have noticed that my file has changed different Funding Managers hands at least 4 times. I am very dismayed about the inability to receive answers from anyone at Lendio or at my Lender. I just received an email saying that my loan cannot be completed, yet the SBA site states that it was Funded. The application process with Lendio was great. It was easy to understand and they seemed to be on top of everything at the start of the application process. Things became very confusing once I had signed the Loan Note Documents. HOWEVER- the real reason for this review was not to cast a shadow on Lendio, but rather to praise Lendio for the following incident that I experienced just a few minutes ago and I felt obligated to compose a review specifically for the following reason. While staring blankly at my Lendio PPP portal homepage, I noticed the  ""Help Chatbox"" on the bottom right side of the page. I finally decided to take a chance and click on the ""Chat"" button. I was truly ready to start a meaningless one-sided chat with some dumb robot service, when to my surprise I was actually greeted by what seemed to be a real person! I proceeded to relay my questions one after another and to my very pleasant surprise, the representative, Isabel Montanez, patiently answered one after the next after the next... Unfortunately she didnt have the ability to fix my main issue (only the Lender could fix the problem..) however, regardless, she was a super-star answering all of my questions without rushing me or any hint of discontent. I want to give a shout out to Isabel Montanez and I want to thank you for your help. It was a truly pleasant surprise and a very informative chat. I truly appreciate it. Youve got a great employee on your hands, Lendio! Have a great day!",5
I never received my loan with lendio it…,"Fast and reliable, the team made everything so easy to go thru the entire process. I am glad I chose Lendio.",1

Very  Professional,Lendio was wonderful. Got my funds quickly and efficiently. I would highly recommend Lendio to anyone,5
Excellent!!,"I trusted Lendio to get me my PPP loan. Big mistake. I first applied back in 2020, when the first PPP draw began. By the time the money ran out, my application had not been approved. When the program rebooted in January of this year, I renewed my application and the portal showed progress over the course of about a month. ""We've received your application!""""We are reviewing your application!""""We've sent your application to lenders!"" Then it reversed course.""We're reviewing your application!""""We've received your application!""Wait. What?I began the frustrating process of getting answers to my questions.Online chat, emails to the ""Account Manager"", finally a phone conversation.They said they needed to clarify some documents and have me change a couple of things in the application... Isn't this part of that review they supposedly did a month ago? Were they planning on telling me about these things instead of waiting for me to contact them?Long story, shorter, after three months they said they couldn't process my paperwork. Not that there was anything wrong with it. Then, magically a week later I was contacted by a lender that works with Lendio. Huh. SmartBiz had my application and was processing it... Okay, great.They asked my for my partnership agreement. I'm a sole proprietor....They asked for my first draw loan number. This is still the application for my first draw...so no loan number.SmartBiz then told me that they couldn't process my loan...Then, I magically received a Docusign request to sign loan docs for my first draw PPP. I filled it out and got my loan a week later.This process took over a year. Now the funds have run out again, and my application for my second draw has been cancelled because it took so long. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if I received an email in a week or so saying that my second draw has been approved, but I'm not holding my breath....Ultimately, I feel like this has been mishandled from the beginning. These loan amounts were quite small as they were for my personal income with no employees. My industry went completely silent for the past year and a half.I live in an underserved zip code. Research tells me that the bulk of the PPP funds went to businesses in high income zip codes. I believe the statistics.",5

Very helpful,"Morgan L was super helpful, quick responses, and gave me the information that I needed without delay.",5
They did a great Job.,Highly recommended!! I wouldn't have been able to get my loan without them,5
Thank you Lendio was very helpful and…,"My experience with Lendio was terrible and I would never use them again. When I first started the application process they followed up by requesting additional documents that were needed which is to be expected but after submitting those docs another person would follow up with the same request. This happened about four times and each time I resubmitted the docs or re-did the application as requested. This went on for over two months and in the mean time I never knew if I was getting the loan or not. I tried several times to call or email and they never answer the phone or responded to emails. After about two months of the runaround I gave up on the idea of getting the loan but then I started receiving messages from them saying that if I didn’t finish my application process soon I would miss my opportunity.  So again I tried to call and sent emails and again never got a response. Low and behold about the third month, I logged into my bank account and the money I applied for was there. In the end I got what I wanted but the process was very painful. I had heard from others who applied through other companies and received their money in two weeks.  By the time I got my money I had already let my two employees go and started a full time job. Now my business is only part time.",5
Simply amazing!,I am very thankful for them helping us through this scary time.,5
Lendio made the process simple and clear.,Lendio is a very Good Choice. Customer service is fast at responding. They take there time answering question. They are honest and pretty  solid with finding the right bank to fund you.  Lendio is really here for you when it comes to handling there clients files they prove loyalty and dedication.,5
All in all,Thanks to their user friendly interface and great customer service I was able as a small business owner to get funds from the PPP loans the two times the government allowed. The first time I tried Chase who I have been banking for lot turned me down so I highly recommend Lendio over the big banks for business,5
Great service,Great company to work with. Very straightforward and easy application process.,5
Excellent service,Lendio thanks for ur service really appreciate it I am 100 percent satisfied for ur service,5
they got it done,Too bad Beth Pratt won’t answer my emails asking why I got a generic email saying I applied for my PPP loan too late (the application was filed in February) and there were no funds reserved for my business.

My experience wasn’t the best,"Bill was very helpful and responsive.  He took the time to understand my business needs and explain the financing options available.  Once we had quotes, Bill walked me through the offers and helped me make a selection.  Mitch helped me through the loan closing later that day.  The whole process was fast, smooth, and seamless - we had funding within 3 days of applying!",2
The process was great.,The only semi negative comment that I would have about the process is that it seemed that I had to answer questions multiple times thus extending the process time well beyond what I expected.  Other than that it was fine.,5

Awesome!,Working with Karol was truly an excellent experienceShe has wonderful customer service skills and very professional You should be very proud to have her on your team,5
"very good thanks,,,","Awful experience.  They solicited loans for the latest PPP2 program.  Our application was approved and an SBA# was assigned in early March.  Today is June 11th and we have not received any funding or documentation.  Nobody at Lendio is responsive other than ""we're following up"" or ""we're escalating"".  When I escalated it myself to Denada Ramnishta, their SVP or Lending, I get no response despite three seperate emails to her.  Unconscionable how little concern they seem to have for the customer.  Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT use this firm.",5
PPP experience went from Too easy to what’s going on..,"It would receive zero stars if I couldIt would receive zero stars if I could. This have been the worst, emotionally draining and frustrating company I have ever in life dealt with. I applied on March 25, 2021, had heard nothing from them at all until I was SBA approved May 14, 2021. Ready Capital denied me after SBA approval because of lack of information. When I reached out to Ready Capital they stated they did not receive the information they needed from Lendio. My funding manager was Ailie Finsland when this initially occurred. Ready Capital then reopened requested documents which I turned in to Ailie Finsland. After Ready Capital received all requested documents, I finally received my PN and signed it on May 22, 2021. The very next day my funding manager changed to Dianne Navarro, who then says my application started all over entirely. I contacted Ready Capital who says I was in the funded stage and have been trying to contact Dianne Navarro to see we’re the miscommunication came in at. She does NOT respond to any of my emails and when I call her and tell her my name she hangs up. It has been 3 weeks with this same issue. I have been SBA approved since 5/14/21, signed my PN 5/22/21 and been in funded status since and have yet to receive any funds. I am keeping my business afloat as much as possible, however, this definitely would do its job and protect my business. Unfortunately, at this time my funding manager has not returned emails or calls and have me sitting in limbo. Now applications are no longer being accepted and I am near or possibly pass the SBA allotted time frame to be funded. Simply because of incompetent people there is now a high possibility my business will not be funded. All I was trying to do was reach out to see if I was missing anything at all and what was going on but I could not even get as much as a response back. That’s my experience, hopefully yours is better than mine, good luck!",4

If i could give them negative stars i…,"Funding Manager; Karl Long, and Customer Experience Representative; Jillian Chambers, have earned are responsible for all 5 stars of this review.  Without their persistent hard work, outstanding communication skills, dedication to their clients, and positive attitudes there is no way I would have been able to navigate through the PPP loan process without them.  Both of them are true professionals who genuinely care about their clients and were there for me every step of the way from the very beginning until both draws were funded. I know Karl Long has thousands of people he's dealing with everyday but he made me feel as though I was his only client. And for every batman there has to be a robin, or in this case Jillian Chambers. They should put her picture next to the definition of Customer Experience Representative because when it gets to crunch time and you need some questions answered or just plain old reassurance, Jillian was there for me.  Thank you Karl Long and Jillian Chambers from the bottom of my heart.  I will never be able to return the favor I owe you guys or express how sincerely thankful I am, but I can at least let others know how great you two are and how much I appreciate all of your hard work and everything you've done for me and my business.  Thanks again guys!",1
Excellent services,"Excellent customer service, fast processing.  A+",5
Great Customer Service,"I worked with Lawrence Levinn at Lendio. Athough I had to go through some issues that needed to be fixed, but Lawrence never stopped his hard and persistent work to solve the issue.  Lawrence, promissed he would take care of this issue all the way and he kept his word. Lawrence is very experienced and knowledgeable of his work and  most importantly he kept his word to me until the end result. Despite the bumpy road, I am glad I went with Lendio because of Lawrence Levinn. Will strongly recomend",5

Thank you so very much and I pray that you get all you deserve in life.you returned all calls answer all questions let me know what I needed to do to continue on with the process. And most of all you had such a beautiful spirit and so much patience with me walking me through the different things that I had no knowledge of.

Thankful!,"Lendio is wonderful! great team, fast response time. overall had a great experience.",5
.My business is restored,If I could leave a negative 5 stars I would!! Dealing with Lendio has been the BIGGEST WASTE OF TIME! I submitted my application for the PPP loan in February when the second round began. They asked for the same documents repeatedly asked the same questions I had already answered again and again. My application had said “sent to the SBA” for months and I’m guessing was never actually sent. There is nobody to call and discuss issues with and nothing gets done apparently. Time for funding ran out and they didn’t get my application to the SBA in time. Thanks for nothing Lendio. Awful awful experience!!!!!!,5

Dianne Navarro was extremely helpful,"Lendio is run by a bunch of “yes” persons. They tell you what you want to hear, but actually don’t do a thing. They promptly answer the phone with their first tier support, but never resolve your issues. I tried working with them for a PPP loan. After three months I contacted Blue Acorn and got funded within two weeks. Additionally, every time I checked my account a new person was in charge of it. Do not trust your money, loans, or any financial help with Lendio.",5

They are a awesome person’s they never…,"I filled out the PPP loan application with the wrong information and submitted it. Then I spoke with my accountant who told me to redo it. I called Lendio and they said they would put it on hold and I could edit it. A few days later, I got the correct figures from my accountant and saw I was entitled to a much larger PPP loan. I called Lendio and was told to just redo the figures on my already existing application. This was at the beginning of March. However, Lendio had already send my information on to Ready Capital and a few days later I received documents to sign from Ready Capital for the lower loan. For two months, I wasted time on hold and speaking to people at both companies, and uploading the same documents over and over. I kept being told that the issue was being taken care of.  One week before the money ran out, I got an email from Ready Capital saying that they could not give me the revised amount since I had not filed a schedule C (but since I am a partnership, I am not supposed to file a schedule C - that was one of the changes my accountant had me fix!). I could accept the lower amount of nothing. Someone from Lendio called me and told me to accept the lower amount; that it better to have something than nothing. So that is what I did.In the end, I realize that I should have cancelled the entire loan application and started from the beginning and I would not have had these programs. At one point I asked Lendio if that is what I should do, but the only answer I got was, ""Is that what you want to do?""Because they did not steer me in the right direction, I did was unable to receive a substantially larger amount, was full of anxiety, and wasted many hours with hours, phone calls and letters of explanation trying to rectify the situation.",5

Absolutely inept staff that made the whole process a complete nightmare and also made me not be able to apply for 2nd draw due to how slowly they processed my first. So saddened by whole thing as I desperately was relying on these funds to keep my small biz afloat.,5
Excellent service!,Great customer service. Very helpful,5

My experience of receiving PPP loan…,Lendio had came through for me with my PPP Loan after a few hitches. I had some back and forth with them so it took some time but they actually did make it happen so I would definitely recommend them,5

Horrible experience.,"Went through Lendio for my First Draw PPP Loan, so it was only right that I let them help with my 2nd. The process was as smooth as the first. I was matched with a lender and funded. I knew to be patient from my first experience. I’m sure they have an overwhelming number of applications, Just trust that once you submit all the documentation requested that they’ll handle the rest.",1
Got the Job ✅,The company seems great and have consistently replied to chats quickly and have been very helpful throughout the process. I signed my promissory note two days ago and was told by a rep yesterday that I had been moved to funding. Today I have no status at all. I am confused.,5
The team was very responsive and was…,Process was very very slow-they referredAnother bank to fund And they had no funds and another one they referred was unable to verify bank account-after doing a little research that had happened with a lot of people who were referredTo smart biz. Never received any funding they them and they were very slow to respond to any correspondence,5
Excellent job quick and easy,Bad service! Funding took over 2 months. They kept asking for more information over and over. I believe just to make up for the delay in funding! Between them and Ready Capital it was a nightmare! I had 3 different Lendio reps each time saying something different. Also my funding amount was lower than any other lender offered! I do not recommend Lendio to anyone!!!! Stay away!,5
Excelente experience.,A great place to get a loan   staff are very helpful,5
Would not recommend Lendio,"I began my Lendio application process for a PPP loan for my small business in the middle of January 2021. I didn't receive the loan until the middle of May, and by then my chances of a second draw were snuffed out.For three months, my application collected dust while I reached out to my Lendio representative, the fourth one that had been assigned to me, by email, text, and phone call. They never responded. I understood I wasn't the only application they were working on, but I felt my application had been forgotten.Meanwhile, Lendio's Newsroom boasted of having ""placed special emphasis on funding the nation’s smallest businesses, including sole proprietors and independent contractors, as well as other segments of borrowers who were underserved in previous rounds... increasing the distribution of loans to smaller, women-owned and minority-owned businesses."" I'm a sole proprietor and a woman, and not once did I feel this drive.In the middle of March, I emailed my representative asking about Lendio's statement that my loan could be based on my Gross Income rather than my Net Income. This would have essentially double my loan amount. I agreed to the change on the website but never saw a change in the Borrower Portal for the new amount. I reached out and asked my representative about that, and again, never received a response of any kind.I sent in extra documents requested along the way, but it never seemed to be enough. I was nervous. That's an understatement. I was terrified that my business wouldn't make it to the end of the year. The PPP deadline, fortunately, moved from the end of March to the end of May so I had a sliver of hope to hold onto.It was radio silence from my representative until I sent an email blast on April 26th to my representative and the three prior representatives basically telling them what you've read so far. Suddenly, I was a top priority. The missing documentation was no longer a mystery, and things were in motion. I still didn't know what my loan amount was as my representative dodged the question every time I asked it. For the record, I asked seven times between March 16th and May 4th.When the loan contract finally came through, it was Friday April 30th. I checked the loan amount. It was to be the original amount based on my Net Income rather than my Gross Income. I asked for it to be corrected. As it was Friday, I waited until Monday to reach out a second time. I reached out and heard nothing back. I emailed again on May 4th, but heard nothing. It turned out I once again had a new representative, so I reached out to them and waited.Then it was Wednesday May 5th. In my inbox from Lendio I saw an email that said ""PPP Funds have run out, but your amount has been reserved."" Now I'm frantic and furious and frustrated and upset and angry and STILL no one has gotten back to me. My accountant and I called and called and called. We finally get the Long Island representative who doesn't understand why I was ignored over and over again. My new representative reaches out and tells me the same, that the last representative's inattentiveness caused me to lose out on what could have been four times the loan amount.FOUR. TIMES. THE. AMOUNT.So now my options were to sign the PPP loan contract I had received or walk away with nothing. It wasn't a choice. I signed the contract. I asked if there was a chance for a second draw. I was told there had been funds set aside for small businesses owned by women and BIPOC, but that Lendio had been telling their clients to apply through a smaller institution to get it.I tried. It froze by the end of the week.When the funds finally hit my business account on May 13th, I wrote myself the paychecks I needed to keep me afloat. I put the experience in the back of my mind.Until today. When Lendio asked me for a five star review, I laughed out loud. I guess we don't always get what we want.",1

easy and efficient,"I appreciated that Lendio followed up with me (with a call) when my application was not complete. I explained the situation and the first person I spoke to was super helpful. He left and I had another person handle my case (less social and didn’t follow up), but ultimately I was happy with the service. I used blue vine too but they sucked. Anyway, overall happy with Lendio. My negative critique would be when someone says I’ll follow up with you or give you the information you asked and never actually came through. Thanks.",5

They made it happen!,"This is the first time I use Lendio and the experience was very pleasant. When I was missing a document Lendio rep would contact me immediately by phone, message and email to make sure I apply all necessary documents for the loan. When my loan got hold for a while, I would follow up with Lendio rep again and they followed up with the lender. They even make sure that I received the fund. It would be a shame without giving them a review after receiving those excellent services from Lendio.I am grateful that I used Lendio.",5

Brittany helped me through the process…,Never let me along when I I was confused with the process. I very glad that always answered my questions in a very simple way.🙏🙏🙏,5
God responding and great following up,When I couldn't get hold of my representative I sent my questions through the chat function.  Laura Burnham from the CX team answered the chat.  She gave me the answers I needed and found out what I needed to complete my application.  To expedite my application she gave me her email.  With Laura's help this took less than 10 minutes total.  I couldn't ask for better customer service!  She's a 5 STAR!!,5
They did a good job.,Laura was great but Brittany Miller funding manager unprofessional rude if you ask me and I don't understand how she is in this type of business you don't speak to people like that I am highly upset with this company periods,4
Many Thanks!,Angelina N. was very helpful I appreciate all the good help.,5

Their application process was smooth…,"Isabel was super responsive, and helped resolve an issue on my account quickly! Thank you!",5
Very helpful and always available,"Nightmare started with Lendio sending my PPP application to Ready Capital in March 202l. Cannot fault Lendio for how bad Ready Capital lied to me after signing the loan doc's and having SBA number in April. HOWEVER, after promising me everything looked good and confirming the issues at Ready are widespread, told me they (Lendio) were sending my application to another Lender on 5/19/21 via email from Bailey Wall. Multiple emails sent, including Lendio's main email, and to this point totally ""ghosted"". Maybe Ready Capital put Lendio in a really bad spot, but at a minimum, you communicate with your customers. I will update and change rating if Lendio EVER GET'S BACK TO ME!!!!!!!Ok, so I see Lendio has responded with request for more information, not sure how I can do that without giving private information on Trustpilot.You could start by looking at emails I sent to Bailey Wall, and also your general email.First name is Eric, last name starts with ""Wil""Just send email to your customer service email with Full Name and mentioned Trustpilot review.Business is under my name as I am sole contractor, self employed. Located in Indiana, area code on my mobile is 317. Need anything else??UPDATE 5/28/21 3:16PMWell I responded with information (see above). Do you have what you need? Have you checked emails? Still nothing,,,,,you stated you wanted to get back to me today!UPDATE 5/28/21 5:38PMWas contacted by Rob at Lendio who seems to be all over this now. Will see how it goes next week, however, he did offer a sincere apology for previous lending manager's issues, and has promised to step in and make it happen, which is all I can ask right now. Good first step.UPDATE 6/9/21 6:34PMShocker, after the original call due to my review on TP from Rob at Lendio on 5/28/21, complete ghost job. Have sent numerous emails and voicemails to him as well as their customer service email, zero replies.It is very clear this company simply does not care, at all.UPDATE 6/28/21Yet another funding manager with the below email;Hello Eric, Netia with Lendio. I have looked over your file and show that your currently in the funding stage, this has been escalated to our Funding Desk for status and to speed things up. Please note when a SBA number is assigned funds should be reserved and we should still have until June 30, 2021, to get you funded! Thank youAny yet a new funding manager today with an email stating the lender has terminated my funding request without ever telling me who the lender was. Supposed to get a communication from whoever the bank is with more detail.Looks like no funds for me, and an crazy poor process from Lendio.",5

The team was engaged via text and email and provided instructions that made this a welcome experience. I think in some cases there are many customers who may prefer to speak with someone directly via phone, and it is for this reason that Lendio would benefit from implementing a chat or secure messaging system for those people who would be more comfortable working directly with someone that can answer their questions.For myself everything was straight-forward therefore no complaints.Kind Regards,Deon Lumpkin",5

With all that's going on in the country…,"My experience with Lendio was trying. The costumer service reps were inexperienced. I called everyday to after receiving a DocuSign. The document was expired and I needed it reset. I called and called only to have started the process over with another bank. Of course I was denied die to duplicate applications. I was livid as no one would just listen and reset my prior DocuSign. After 45 days I finally reached an agent who reset my Docusign and funds were disbursed. However, now I’m unable to receive a second draw die to PPP expiration. While I am grateful for Lendio, I only wish the agents were more knowledgeable and this could have been avoided.",5
Lendio was excellent throughout this…,"Professional , courteous and quick . A pleasure to do business with them.",5
It was an easy and painless process…,"Overall I was satisfied with the service.  The only reason for a four star rating versus a five star rating is due to communication.  There were times when it was absolutely necessary to talk to an actual human being.  Getting in contact with a human who was difficult at times.  End the end it all worked out, I just felt like the person to person communication could be a little more user friendly/readily available.  Again all and all I was satisfied and it was a positive experience working with Lendio",4
Great program,Such an awesome experience. She was so patient with me! ♥️,5
Great at what they do,"Communication was terrible. I used Lendio for my PPP loan process and the agents I had were terrible with communicating with me. They say there was missing documentation but when I reached out to the many different Funding managers, none of them would respond to tell me what documents were missing. I’d get calls from different agents with messages about how a contract was “sent” but funnily enough, there is no record of any contracts being sent to my emails. They just “disappeared” into cyber space I guess. Funny how that works. I missed out on my opportunity at getting a loan for my business because of the slow responses from my agents as well as lack of communication. I would not recommend.",5

After 20+ phone calls, 90 emails, and a solid month waiting to get approved I don't think I'll ever work together with Lendio ever again. Other people I know that applied for the PPP loan received approval in days. This whole process was extremely time consuming and their customer service was no help at all.",5
they got the loan done fast and efficiently...,"I went with Lendio because recommendation by insurance company. I finalized my paperwork with Lendio by Jan 21 2021. Starting from February and until mid of April I was calling Lendio on a weekly basis to follow up with status of my application. I had several account managers assigned to my application through out the process. None of them were responsive. Numerous calls and emails to them did not help. More than that, at certain time Lendio introduced 2 factor authentication (good), but your technical support was not helpful either.

I was told I would hear in a couple of days.Got email from someone else so didn’t respond then called and was told been passed to another person,worked with that lady, got what she needed then, was sent to another person. A male ,which was hard cause he said he was working with the other person and kept asking for same papers ,  My son said just treat like job send anyone and everyone that ask for the nformation even if sent twice. Which is what I did. Finally got my loan so it all worked out just very confusing. One thing the emails wore confusing asking for stuff that I just sent.The lady would confirm she had the info then I’d get a email that said they needed that same thing. Bottom line I got the loan. Turn around time was not what they said in the beginning but hey I got it.",5

Hard workers,"What is the use of a Loan Manager?? Its like playing Musical Chairs?? I have had so many I stopped counting and only spoke to one. Who lied to me about my application status and timeframe for its approval. My application had been submitted and "" approved"" for months. Then they ask for more information...Who reviewed it initially? SMH I had one lender contact me informing me that they were handling the loan. Soon after that Lendio told me that I now have a new Bank/lender that is now asking me for a new application.?? This is a real Sh-T show. I went to another lender and was approved without all of this back -n- fourth and requiring no additional information. They got all they needed in there initial application. I actually asked them if they needed some of the information Lendio was requesting. I was told they needed no additional information. SMH what a waste of time. What a Circus. Did you read their reply. They could not find me in their system...WOW that says it all!!!",5
Superb experience,"Completely inept! I applied for the PPP loan in November. They ""processed"" it for ever until funds ran out. Then when the 2nd round was released, they emailed me to resign my application, and again it went in to ""processing."" Here I am 4 months later, 5 loan officers later, WITHOUT a PPP loan. I got an email a month ago saying my application was approved and I'd be hearing from someone about my loan details. You know what I heard? From another Lendio loan officer today that I needed to RESIGN my application! Again!! And I just heard from another bank (since I'm tired of the run around) that the funds are all gone and the round is closed! WHAT THE HECK!! This company is a joke. So extremely disappointed.",5

Quick and easy,"I cannot even put into words my gratitude for Kasey. I had applied for 2nd round PPP and hit a few glitches for months actually. When it felt like all hope was lost and frustrations had reached max, Kasey reached out via email and it was godsend. I hadn't barely been able to talk to a person during this whole process and so when Kasey reached out it was a life line. I explained to her what was happening and she responded right way, even within the hour. The next day she even texted me directly which was so helpful and I knew she was with me, and felt 100% confident in her and her guidance. She called me when she figured out what had been happening with the application and made sure I knew she was on it to correct it. This process took sometime to sort out, and Kasey never dropped the ball. She was in it all the way til the end until I got funded and for her level of care and commitment I am forever grateful. You do not find that level of humanity out there now a days - so it was pure grace to have this person helping along the way especially when it has to do with money and your business !! Kasey is a perfect example customer service and I am beyond impressed with her work as I was about to throw the towel in. She will be my first point of contact if anything ever comes up and would recommend her to anyone. Overall a brilliant, intelligent, dedicated and heart centered person. Thank you Kasey!",5

Funding Manager Karl Long and Customer Experience Representative Jillian Chambers,I have been keenly tracking the progress of my PPP loan 2nd Draw application for the past 2 months or so since we were assigned the SBA#6048768601. The assigned SBA# gave me a sense of pending positive outcome. I was however wary after waiting for many weeks without receiving closing documents. I have checked in with Lendio every 7-10 days to learn the progress. I received no response back from the loan manager assigned to my loan application but generally had good response through the on-line Chat support functions. In the last 4 weeks or so I have been told the I'd receive DocuSign contracts from the matched lender anytime soon. Today I learned from Isabel Montanz that my matched lender has declined my loan application. This is very disappointing and I hope there are ways to recover and re-apply. Isabel told me that Lendio may be able to re-match me with a new lender after receiving the notification email from this lender. Isabel was very helpful but my overall experiences have not been all positive. Certainly I have not achieved the ultimate goal of closing the PPP loan 2nd Draw with Lendio thus far but I am still hopeful at this time.,5
Excellent customer service,"I received the loan amount I was expecting . Although it took a little longer than I expected, I was informed along the way as to the status by logging into the Lendio portal so that helped. I'm extremely thankful that my loan was granted.Thanks",5

Meghan Finning was very helpful in the…,"I am a very unhappy business owner. I have expressed my concerns to My Funding Manager: Elena Child , since I started having issues before the funds ran out at the SBA! After a month of no resolution from the lender I was referred, I was told to request a new loan document to have my funds placed in our new business account. I was told by Elena Child that the exhausted funds had nothing to do with a already approved and funded loan. My loan was sent to an closed account and I was told by Ready Capital to wait and they will send a New Loan Document to retrieve the funds. I have yet to receive an conclusion  to my issue. Now the funds are not reachable due to the exhaustion of funds and the lack of support from the lender to resubmit in a timely manner.  I have lost the PPP loan due to this error and now I am trying as a small business owner to keep my business going. This saddens me when I just wanted to keep my employees, now I may have to close my doors.To add, the response below from Lendio didn't apologize or resolve the issue I still am dealing with. Ready capital has yet to send a new loan document after 2 months,  nor have they responded. Also, My Funding Manager: Elena Child has yet to respond to emails or calls regarding the issue, after I was promised that this person will always respond to help and assist. It's been weeks since I emailed and called My Funding Manager: Elena Child. That is my biggest problem.  No response, no resolution.",4

Bianca Jones was very helpful,it was a very good service and they followed up with me till I got the loan.,5
Working with Lendio,"Lendio did a good job.  My only complaint is that the amount of the total PPP loan available was different in the online form that it was from the representative.  I wanted to understand the difference and if there were any other options for raising the amount. I suspected there were, but communications was a bit difficult.  I suppose the reason was the company reorganization and being very busy trying to get all the loans completed before the deadline.  After completing the loan info, they passed it off to Square Capital.  That company was terrible!  They made many mistakes and were near impossible to communicate with.  We almost gave up. But that's not Lendio's fault.",5

Great Communication,"I was unfamiliar with and unsure about Lendio before I started, but I found them to be customer-oriented, legitimate, and in fact very communicative about their process in connecting me to a lender.  Ultimately, it was the lender bank which was (later) the source of delays, extremely poor communication, and confusion.

Great experience,"Best service ever! Your organization excels beyond any commercial bankin processing the PPP loan application. How do I know this? Because I'm a CPA with multiple clients who have applied. These clients have all expressed views regarding their experiences with commercial banks. They rated these banks from extremely difficult to impossible. I started my own application with my bank and just gave up. Lendio, you're the best!",5
Worst experience I’ve ever had,"Lending staff started out great but dropped the ball during my process. He first mistake was an error in calculating how much I qualified for and after many weeks of trying to get the application corrected i was approved for over 13 thousand, but never received correct loan contract. So after 4 months of trying to get correct funds I recieved 1,400.  I know I should be thankful I got any money but when someone tells you your approved for 13k and you only get 1,400 it’s quite disappointing. During this process I emailed called texted everyone who was assigned to my case and tried dealing directly with ready capital who was the lender and that was even more frustrations. So over all very unsatisfied with the service I recieved.",1
Angelina N was awesome,"Everything when jus as it was laid out ie presented to me,that’s why",5

thanks for the quick help,"To tell the truth it started out really really hard I’m not a technical person I struggle with us a lot technology is not my thing working with my hands is in 2019 my small buisness made 72,000 and some change in 2020 it only made in the lower 30,000 tmneither one is as great deal of money but it doesn’t take much imagination to think of all the ways the difference in the two would effect someone ! I personally require very little in the way of material things my buisness is a flooring installer and I work hard to make a living when Covid hit full speed I felt it not only did I feel it I was scared and always being self employed I’ve never had the unemployment or any other assistance Readily available to me , so worried and only knowing that no work means no money I almost took to the streets to do things that were not ever supposed to be an option or a thought in my head again this sent me into a work wind of thoughts and emotions that , to say the least , troubled me in more ways than most . I’ve worked hard to straighten my path and even harder to show a community , atleast the ones that truly matter my children my love and the rest of the people some with doubts some without that I’m changed and those ways were a thing of the past .anyways without the help of one Lendio employee by the name of t’quoa Boyd and I’m sure I just butchered  her name , who not only helped me with my total lack of technical skills never lost confidence in the ability of her employers and herself to get me this loan money that I needed in order to save the material Things and the things she couldn’t possibly understand that were at stake , but they nothing more than her ability to keep me inching forward thru something that probably takes the average person a few hours took me and only with her help days and hours of her selflessness did I reach our goal I received my first loan and was able to pay much needed bills and my help and I wish I  could express what Lendio and ready capital have done to change my life from a place where I thought only the unthinkable was the only option,  to we didn’t have to go around anything ,because with those two I learned we can go right thru it , and I might not have all I did and I still don’t have enough but now atleast I have my pride my dig my freedom and hope that there is truly not only light at the end of the tunnel but good people and relief thank you T’quoa Boyd and ready capital too !!!",5

Laura Burnham was very helpful with…,It took too long to get the first draw causing me to lose out on the second draw because PPP ran out of funds.,5
Amanda five stars thanks,"I applied for a PPP loan through Lendio on the first day that funds became available, in late January 2021. Since then, over the past nearly four months, I've had the most frustrating experience of my life—literally HUNDREDS of unanswered phone calls and emails to Lendio (not joking, hundreds), no status updates, no information, and all the while literally every other business I know has long since funded through other lenders. For the past two months, on the rare occasions that I've been able to make contact, Lendio has assured me that my loan was in the final stages, and within a week or two of funding. My loan has been with the lender, Ready Capital, for a month. Just today, I received an email saying that the PPP funds are gone and I'm not getting my loan. My business has been devastated by COVID, and though we're starting to bounce back, I've been banking on PPP funds to get us through the next four months, especially as other relief (like rent relief from my commercial landlord) are ending. To say I'm frustrated is the understatement of a lifetime. This is absolutely devastating for my business, myself, and my employees, and not receiving my funds is 100% the fault of Lendio and Ready Capital. This has been the worst experience with a lender (or business of any kind) that I've ever had. The program designed to support small businesses has instead cost me countless hours of my time, an exorbitant amount of stress, and now Lendio has screwed me out of the money my business desperately needs out of their own inept handling of PPP applications. At a vulnerable time for small business in this country, their behavior is disgraceful. DO NOT USE LENDIO.",5
Laura Burnham was absolutely amazing,I was able to receive much needed help every step of the way. Definitely appreciate the help you gave.,5

Even before I applied for the PPP loan for my husband and myself, they were very quick at responding and very helpful in explaining what needed to be done.  When I did my husband's application, he was contacted shortly after it was submitted and they guided him through the process.  For me, there were some things I was unsure of but I contacted them and they explained what I needed to do.  When I submitted my application, the gentleman contacted me within the hour and followed up when they needed additional information.  When that was done, he explained what the rest of the process would be like and of course assured me if I had any problems, don't hesitate to reach out.  It was a smooth process from start to finish and very quick.  Now that the PPP loan process has expired, I would definitely go back to them for my small business needs in the future.  Thank you so much Lendio for coming through for my family and I when we needed the help the most!!!",5

Excellence,Easy to work with and i appreciate their professionalism,5
5 ☆ out of 5 ☆!!,"The loan process with Lendio was challenging, but not from a qualification standpoint.  What made the process difficult was the repeated requests for the same items from several different people, or from the same person multiple times, and that none documents sent were ever processed.  Everyone was courteous in their communication, but we were left with this overarching sense that the team at Lendio didn't have a handle on what they were doing.  After an agonizing amount of back and forth the loan was eventually funded, for which we are grateful, but based on this experience I doubt we would choose to do business with Lendio again.",5

I had to send documents more than once, as well as explain that they already had the documents they were waiting for.

I was told that I would be able to get the loan for the same amount as the first. However with Lendio's lack of help I received approximately $4500.00 less than the first round, and that extra money I was really counting on.  Yes the money that I received I am very grateful for, but because of Lendio's lack of help I'm behind again because I couldn't fulfill the obligations that I told people relying on what Lendio's ""great team"" told me.

Very pleasant and nice,"I had never heard of them prior to this, honestly, but decided to go with them after reading mostly positive reviews and after finding out that they were indeed a legitimate business. I didn't know what to expect but I presumed the process would be lengthy and complicated. Turns out, not so at all, at least in my case. Their form is straight forward and therefore very easy to fill out.I ended up submitting the wrong bank statements so that delayed the process a bit. What impressed me the most is that they stayed on top of it even as I pretty much ignored the whole thing after submitting my initial application. They kept asking me for whatever else was necessary and kept me up to date via email and text the entire time. Honestly, I felt a little embarrassed about how sloppy I was during the proceedings. Lucky for me, they weren't; they really got me the loan with little effort or attention on my end.",5

I have been banking with the same financial institution my entire life and have all my business banking done with this same large bank.  They denied my application several times without even asking for additional clarification or information.  But with Lendio it was super easy.  Their representative contacted me immediately and worked with me to find a lender for the PPP funds.  It was very easy to send them the documents they required and my representative always called if there was a question.  In very little time, the funds were deposited into my business account.  Great experience.  Helpful, friendly and efficient.",1

Very service oriented,Unfortunately I'm sorry to say that Lendeo was more than a joke to work with they bounced me around to six or seven different people although I was qualified for a loan double the amount I ended up being forced to take the loan and half the amount because after weeks of getting a DocuSign in the incorrect amount funds were running out.   They had very poor communication with their third party lender ready capital.  I was told by Linda they put seven tickets in to fix the loan amount but it never was fixed I'm grateful that I did get the loan however I was entitled to double what I got.,5

Client service,"Very professional, outstanding will use Lendio again and recommend to our business partner and friends,",5
Lendio's funds have been a great help…,A wonderful company- very competent and caring set of people. They sense the anxiety that you feel and are remarkably caring about it. I was dealing mainly with a person called Vichet Inhar at Lendio. Give him and His company 5 stars!!!,5
Wonderful experience,"Lendio was okay, although the bank they partnered with seemed overwhelmed. Communication could have been better from both Lendio and their bank (Ready Capital). But they were able to completed my loan and other people that I know as well.",5
The process was quick,Ultimately you referred me to a company that got me funded. So I am grateful but disappointed that you could not do it.,5
Amanda B,Some guy called to ask me to bump my review up a “star or two”. He was nice at first then started cutting me off. Totally rude. For that reason i will keep it at one star. Site is also difficult. Tiffany is amazing. She is five stars.,5

Excellent service,Laura B was extremely efficient and helpful!,5
Very slow process,"The overall experience was not bad, however there was one very annoying request. The lenders kept asked me for a voided check at least 6-7 times. I had to try and call them and explain I had already sent them what they had requested but for some reason they kept asking for the same thing over and over again. Anyway I persisted and kept sending them the requested things and finally I got approved. It took a long time but I guess better late then never.",4
Great service,"Lendio was very helpful getting everything I needed for my loan. They made everything quick and clear, and it took a lot of stress away from the process.",5
My agent was extremely helpful and…,Lendio has been a blessing in helping me with my business and the ppp loans. Everyone who has helped me has gone above and beyond. Thank you Lendio for your support through the pandemic.,5
Thank you Lendio for your help and…,"Submitted my Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) application early in the “pre application” window, waited 5 months for Lendio to process my application only to find out they took too long and I missed out on the PPP because of them even though I did everything correctly and even submitted my application early.  Here are some highlights, * TERRIBLE communication, worst I’ve ever seen from a company. They never told me they needed anything from me, they never contacted me for anything, no updates on the progress etc. The only times I found out they were waiting on a document from me was when I called in. I even checked my spam email and logged into my Lendio account every day. * Wrong information was displayed on my dashboard * Said they needed documents I already gave them multiple times* Got a different story nearly every time I talked them. For example I emailed them for an update and they said the SBA couldn’t match the loan number to the one I gave them even though the number I had was off an official SBA document that said “loan number”. Called Lendio to give that to them and turns out they didn't need the loan number they needed my businesses EIN - even though they already had it, it was on 3 or 4 of the documents I had given them and in the information I filled out on the application. * Was assigned a funding manager which seemed great but they changed my manager 5 times in 4 months and NONE of them helped me. Most of the responses I got from them were poorly written emails with weird email signatures that actually made me question if it was spam. One manager even asked me to send a picture of my ID through email (even though I already uploaded it during the application) which is not secure and when it is possible to do this online. I did everything I was supposed to and was treated terribly and ultimately missed out on the PPP because of Lendio. This is probably the worst experience I have ever had with a company as a whole. I’ve had more unprofessional encounters with reps but never had an experience like this with a company as a whole.",5
thank you for helping me out.,"Help me all the way thru, when i was having problems with documents with the lender.  Thank you so much i did now know how i was going to make rent and pay my expenses to stay a float",5

Very good & fast service they are very…,"Way too long to receive any assistance, unresponsive, horrible experience to receive one round of PPP fundsI'm now aware I wasn't the only one who had to fight and email and constantly hound the funding managers to get funded. I had to submit the same documents again and again. For another friend using Lendio, they left her hanging. She couldn't even withdraw her application to try and get help else. Terrible, terrible service!",5
They were responsive & informative.,"Lendio has done a remarkable job of processing many PPP loans. I am honored they were able to help me with our PPP Loan. IN the last 10 days of the process, I was impressed how Lendio personnel reached out to me to report on the progress. As I mentioned before, it was honor to work with this team",5
Awesome company!,"Lendio was great!  Fast service on my loan, two and a half weeks from accepting my application to getting the funds in my bank!  Will use Lendio again!",5
Care beyond Measure,"Lendio Denver offers first class customer service!  I was having an issue with funding of my PPP loan.  It was  being handled via a Lendio office in another state.  I had been attempting for over a month to get an error corrected with no results, just over and over ""it is in process and will be done in a few days."" I was referred to Bill at Lendio Denver to see if he could help.  Bill contacted me immediately and started working on the issue.  This was not a problem Bill's office had created, but a competing Lendio office in another state.  He had nothing to gain other than trying to help another business in need.  He contacted a connection he had with Lendio Corporate and in just over 12 hours, something I had been fighting with for over a month, the issue was resolved.  Lendio Denver operates on a principle that many businesses lack today, customer service.  Don't hesitate to let Bill help you with your lending needs.",5
Oscar was great,"This last two months has been a journey dealing with Lendio and Ready Capital. They actually came through....

Service,"Worst service ever.  I applied on day one the portal was opened.  3 months of waiting and numerous of hours on the phone and chat with Lendio agent, whole process was nothing but nightmare.  Lendio and lending partner, Ready Capital made mistake with PLP caused unnecessary months of delay.  My application got mixed up with someone else's.  Couldn't pass the validation because of ""ghost applicant"" on my application. Either Lendio or Ready Capital helped with making necessary correction.   As a result of I lost the opportunity to apply for second draw.",5
Lendio rocks!,Excellent service,5
PPP Made Simple,Perfect experience!!! Love it!,5
My experience was awesome and I would…,"I applied for a PPP loan with Lendio.  The application was straight forward.  Problems occurred when they handed it off to Ready Capital.  There was a problem with loan details I identified before funds were deposited.  Icontacted ready capital multiple times and submitted help desk tickets to get the error corrected early.  Ready Capital did not correct it, and there was little coordination with Lendio email messages.Long story short, this error prevented me from accessing the PPP funds for several weeks while I tried to clean up the mess with my bank.  Lendio initially blew off my criticisms and said it was Ready Capital’s fault.  I disagree.  I did business with Lendio.  It is Lendio’s responsibility to mange its partners and vendors and make its customers whole when their vendor drops the ball.",5

Both the funding manager and the individual I was working with dropped out of contact and would not answer phone calls, text messages, or emails. The only way that I was able to contact anyone was by posting a message on their Facebook wall asking why nobody has contacted me. Minimal steps were taken to give any additional information. The only helpful individual was from Ready Capital. Would not recommend Lendio.",3
Lendio was helpful and reactive,Excellent service.  The PPP loan process was quick and painless.  It took me maybe an hour of time to do from start to finish.,5
Lendio was able to secure a PPP loan,"Thanks so much for your assistance in getting the SBA loan.

Spectacular company they do what they…,"Hello,I really liked the service received from Lendio and Ms. Vallerie who helped me was just outstanding! However, it seems to be a lack of communication because I would receive strange emails scaring me that my loan was going to be cancelled!

Great service,"I’ll give “0” star is I could Terrible customer service, phone calls and emails go unanswered. Was promised certain amount, got not even half of it.

Process for PPP Loan.,"Though it’s confusing to do it all on line without the aid of a physical office or to be with a representative, I’m thankful that it worked out and went through",5
This was a great experience,Lendio's lender has never responded to any of my messages. Why does lendio partner with non responsive companies? Slow and disorganized responses from lendio seem to be the norm.,5
Lack of response,Lendio made the PPP application very simple and easy with their all digital platform.  Completing the application and uploading the necessary documents was efficient and easy.  My loan was approved and funded in less than a week.,1
great experience,Haven’t about a month. I just received my ppp loan that I had been approved for back on March 27th 2021. Just received it April 30th direct deposit.,5
Great experience,Lendio was helpful all the way and answered immediately when I sent ina request. i was very impressed with their constant connecting to me and to assure me that they were on top of my application.,5
Very quick and helpful,The process took way longer than it should and the partners Lendio uses (Ready Capital) are the worst. No one was ever available and the Lendio representative wasn't able to help either. WORST experience I ever had and I am not using them EVER again.,5

presedent,Didn't like the fact that there was no one to talk to when in need of help.  No weekly update on status of process.  Had to email documentations over and over.

Thank you for all you help,"The final outcome was good, but somehow the ball was dropped from the time I submitted the final application and several months later when I started getting what appeared to be spam emails from unknown (to me) lending company.  I deleted the emails because the number of fake Docusign emails has been on the rise over the last 6 months.  It wasn't until the lending company called me and asked why I had not replied.  I explained to them that I had no idea who they were nor why they were sending me the Docusign emails.  It was only after that call that I received an email from Lendio, identifying the lender.",5

For the most part things went smoothly,The process was somewhat un organized this time around. I had several different people handling myfile initially. However let me say I’ve worked with Lendio for a while and usually they are wonderful. I just can’t give 5 stars this time around because my service was not. I would imagine in all fairness that it was managing the overload of applicants and demand.,4
Very good,"This program is awesome, in ways that it help struggling Americans get back on their feet. Thanks for supporting and keeping the American dream alive",5

I am very pleased with Lendio and it's…,My Lendio Specialist was extremely detailed in helping all the way through the process. She communicated every step of the way.,5
I never received my pp loan,"I chose Lendio to apply for a PPP Loan. Now it’s very likely that much of the confusion was because these loans are new since the pandemic and was unexpected for all these companies. I can’t imagine how busy they are and how challenging it’s been, especially having to learn the in’s and out’s of the new product we all want and need!  That said, there are several things that seem like a breakdown in their system rather than the new product it self.   As you fill out the application online, you have to upload tax documents, personal Identification, 1099’s/W2’s, and a cancelled check for direct deposit. All valid and expected. After submitting all of this, I started receiving emails from 2 people saying  I didn’t upload some documents. Not the case. They actually wanted other documents.  Full tax returns and bank statements.  Then, over the next 9 weeks, I had 2 more contacts asking for full tax returns, tax return transcripts from the IRS web site, and more bank statements.  They each asked for the exact same info but in different formats on different documents. A bit ridiculous! Then the application goes to the SBA and then a lender who each asked for more and for duplicates.  9 weeks later I was finally approved and had received the money.  You can’t reach any of these contacts 90% of the time, and after sending emails, texts and voicemails, I sometimes waited 7-10 days to get a response. This was my first round and I was hoping to apply for the second that we’re allowed; however, after taking so long for this one... the SBA is out of funds!I hoping that someone at Lendio can look at this information and even contact me forbetter details and possibly fix or streamline some of the process for the future!

Review,Horrible Experience! Unless something changes this company is doomed! No calls back ever?  No customer service help?Asked to resubmit documents they lost more than once. No good structure in the process Sorry guys! Only reason I had to use them was because American Express did our company’s first PPP and they chose lendio to handle their customers second PPP.  American Express management even told me it was a bad decision on there part.  And they were getting a ton of complaints on lendio.  This is my experience with Lendio.  Do your own research. I would of never choose them knowing what I know now for the loan!Good luck,5

I went through Lendio for the ppp loan…,It took almost 90days and I had to submit and resubmit the same paperwork multiple times.

Crystal was able to help answer some of my questions and helped to get us more in the know of what is going on with my application.,5
Very courteous and knowledgeable,"Your selection of ReadyCapital was not a good one.  Due to their poor communication (read: ignored), I am told funding has now been exhausted for my second draw.  That has a major financial impact for me.  RC should never again be recommended by Lendio.  They are incompetent at best.  If legal action were within my capabilities, I would file against RC and possibly you.  Frustrated beyond.  THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO LENDIO’S COMMENT - YOUR INACTION RELATES TO MY SECOND DRAW.  PLEASE CONTACT ME - YOU HAVE MY INFORMATION.",5

Easy to work with and i appreciate…,Ledio helped me get my second round PPP Loan.  My lender from my first PPP Loan had a mismatch on my social and tax ID on my first application.

My lender from my first PPP that made the mistake would not fix it and I tried 6 other lenders for the second PPP.  Lendio contacted the SBA and my first PPP lender and got the mismatch fixed and I got my second round PPP Loan.  Lendio is the only lender that offered to help me.

Everything submitted within the first week. Over and over again was told they reviewed it and I’d get less money and less money. This took more than two months. If I had questions or needed to know what was taking so long there was NO ONE to answer anything! I called, emailed and text the people who were supposedly working on my loan but no one ever got back to me. I even tried to contact the phone number and email address on the website to no avail.

Great Customer Service,Small Biz champions!Lendio makes it direct and simple to access capital. Very straightforward process.,5
The overall experience was not bad,"LENDIO/Ready Capital was very DIFFICULT to work with for the second round PPP!  We had such a wonderful experience the first time in 2020.  But the second round process took well over 3 months to close!!  They NEVER returned any of my calls, the representative assigned to our file was extremely rude and demanding.  I would NOT recommend them for any SBA loan.  They are really good with taking all the information, but terrible with follow up.  Their supposed 'real-time' website was never updated and accurate with our status.  I certainly can go on and on, but suffice it to say, we were not satisfied with the service we received from them.  If/when there's a next time, we will find another lender.",4
very slow process,Thank you thank you thank you is all I can really say. The process was a bit lengthy but definitely worth it.,2
Lendio was very helpful getting…,Everything went well from the front to the back of this transaction very professional and efficient and good follow up and return calls I will definitely refer you all to this company,5
Lendio has been a blessing in helping…,Thank you Lendio - it did great job to help us to get the small business loan. Thank you for your hard work lendio!,5
Lendio Screwed Up My PPP Application,The difference with Lendio is that there was always someone to chat with or contact.  The process was fast and easy.,1
Help me all the way,Amazing customer service and sense of urgency.,5
"Chat Support with a real, live  Person!","We used Lendio to assist us with our first PPP loan.  Without their help and them being able to cast a ""wider net"" we feel we would never have received that loan through our business bank (who wouldn't even return our calls).  The process with Lendio was straightforward and their level of communication through the process was amazing.  They connected us with a great lender and even that process was seamless.  Subsequently, that same lender worked with us again for PPP loan #2 and we have been very pleased.",5
closed the deal!!,"Lending,Is great 👍👌 they have a great team..",5
Horrible experience to receive one round of PPP funds,"Your Agent done a very  fantastic job, faster ready to recommend you to all my friends thanks.",1
Cordell was an amazing Manager,"Lendio was responsive, helpful, and got the job done. Very happy with their service.",5
LATPgroup Lendio review,"A customer service rep spent over an hour on the phone with me walking me through the application process when I couldn't even get on the phone with a real person at any other lending agency. She was so helpful and patient and I was actually approved for the PPP loan with Lendio (after being rejected by other companies just because I was filling out the form incorrectly with no explanation from them, even though I was TOTALLY qualified for this loan). Lendio is great and I would 1000% work with them again.",4
Lendio was great,"I worked with Bill Airy at Lendio in Denver Colorado.   I originally applied for my second PPP loan through U.S. Bank where I got my first PPP loan.   I applied with U.S. Bank on February 5, 2021 and U.S. Bank declined the loan on April 26, 2021 after dozens of request for information that I fulfilled.   I have been a U.S. Bank customer for 25 years and I keep a fair amount of money on deposit with them.   I applied with Lendio and Bill on April 26, 2021 right after I was turned down by U.S. Bank and my loan was funded on May 5, 2021.   Thank you, Bill, and Lendio for helping me keep my payroll going during this difficult time.",5
Phenomenal Customer Service,"Great experience, good follow up and successful outcome.",5
I received funding in 2 weeks.,It was ok but is hard when you have to deal with automatic phone conmversation.,5
Fantastic Service!,Total chaotic experience; especially with all the repitition involved: eg: sending the same documents multitude of times; never knowing the status of the application; being told the loan was approved only to have to resubmit and resign the SAME documents; never knowing who we were dealing with: Lendio or Ready Capital.  Total confusion ....could not even receive an accurate Loan Application Number.,5
This last two months has been a journey…,I am happy with them!,2
Very satisfied with Lendio,They worked closely with us to make the process easy and smooth. I am looking forward to do business with Lendio again.,5

Exellent,You help me understand and get help in this troubling time. Thank you so much for working so hard at helping me.,5
Still waiting to be funded,Lendio is great except for the lender whom they work with r disaster who is ready capital.  Customer service at lendio is amazing but ready capital the worst customer service. The woman at the customer service at ready capital was nasty 🤢 short and didn’t even wanted to talk to me. I really felt discriminated how short she was with me didn’t want to answer my questions even thought i was on a call for more than an hour.  I just wished lendio would choose better partners to work with. But at this day and age u can’t really have much choices since it’s ELM 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽  How come lendio approved the funding for Me but Ready capital has denied for no reason i find it’s absolutely discriminated. I wish i never had to deal with Ready capital. I guess i need to change my last name to compliment BLM now,3
The best,"Lendio helped us to get funding before the pandemic and they were great. However, when the pandemic hit us it was Lendio, not our bank, who was there for us every step of the way. Through their lenders we obtained both PPP loans quickly.  As far as I’m concerned there is no one better than Lendio and will proudly recommended them to anyone.",5
The best service,"We found Lendio through our merchant service processing company...easy, professional process to secure funding to get us through the forced closing of our restaurant during the pandemic. We were able to pay key employees to ensure their longtime position employed with us and enabled reopening an easier task.",5
Customer service answered my questions…,"I submitted my application in January, was passed back and forth between different ""account managers"" for weeks without making any progress and am now supposedly under review with the management but have heard nothing back. Still no funding when I completely qualify for PPP, four months later.  Zero concern or correspondence from the staff at Lendio. Find another provider.",5

My Sincere And Honest Review,"They were very nice and easy to work with. Best of all, they helped us get approved and we got the funds we needed. Would definitely recommend!",4
I’ll give “0” star if I could,"If late or no responses are not an issue, customer service of no importance and replies to your inquires not relevant, if online system can be glitchy, look no further. I applied for 1st draw of PPP, system forced me to sign everything every time I logged in. SBA loan # is incorrect. Second draw PPP can't be initiated. Customer service nowhere to be found. They changed my funding manager name and contact information over dozen times.",1

Process was smooth and I was informed…,"Lendio had great customer service I had a huge issue with docusign authentication questions that I won't go into because it gets my pressure up. Lendio assigned me a document verification specialist and together we worked through it successfully.  I ""had"" (heh heh) to email her several times a day to coordinate with my lender and get this done.  My contact at lendio was vital for that and stayed in contact with me via email and even text messages when I was being stubborn and wouldn't read my emails.  I was very frustrated with docusign, but everyone I talked to at lendio was cool under the pressure I was intentionally putting on them especially my immediate contact there, Jennifer Sorensen a very capable document verification specialist at lendio, for a week I politely explained to her how one by one everyone involved in this process was a huge idiot because I did own an '89 Buick and Docusign don't know me like that, I was always polite with her and she with me even while asking her things like ""what is it that you even do, like start doing it"" because she is the only person in the world at that point that I believed wasn't a complete idiot she always knew what to do I just didn't want to listen because DocuSign is the devil. What does she do, as it turns out Jennifer Sorensen at lendio kicks butt that's what, finally I listened and her suggestions got my loan funded, thinking back maybe it wasn't everyone else fault maybe it was just docusign's. You thought I was gonna say maybe it was my fault lol, no It probably wasn't.   I'm confident my 2nd draw ppp loan will be as well taken care of as my first was, thank you Jennifer Sorensen. P.s. DocuSign is the worst thing since the remote control microwave, but what can ya do, it's everywhere, we need a Docusign vaccine stat... Just saying....    I am being completely honest in my review of lendio they were great and they didn't make docusign after all, China did, they make everything including the remote control microwave, and I have not been offered any invective at all, even though I would have no shame accepting like maybe a door dash gift card and like 8 bucks or something, I mean come on honestly who don't like 8 bucks and a burger huh...Just saying...",5

Excellent services,"The representative that handled my account was excellent. Your software used to interface with the net and collect the needed data was very good. After all requirements were met, it took a long time to connect with a lender, maybe this was out of your control.  I signed the SGA loan documents provided by the lender, and the 72 hour funding process took over a month and only after I threatened to contact the SBA.  Your representative stated that Lendio could do nothing to help.  The service was poor, because you chose a bad lender, and said you could do nothing to help.",5

They was the most disorganized group to deal with. I applied the second day the loan was available, Lendio transferred my application to Ready Capital, from there things went down hill .  It took over 4 months to get loan approved, I don’t think I would have gotten Approved an finished if it wasn’t for Leanne Allen with Lendios. I would not call Ready Capital for a loan to build a dog house. They put me through total mental Hell .  Use Lendios BUT WHAT EVER YOU DO, DONT LET YOUR LOAN GET SENT TO READY Capital!!!",5
Thank you Lendio Team!,"System was perfect.   However the account manager contact was non existence and his phone number was not working.  It was impossible to get a hold of anyone.  Other than that, and if you don't have any issues self-serving yourself, all good.",5

It was great working with Lendio,"nice, great, fast",5
Lendio is one of the best PPP providers…,While they did help to secure my PPP small business loan.. the process was confusing at times.  Everything was done on line and there was no voice conversation or interaction.    Also the amount of the same paperwork that was submitted didn't make sense. Maybe I'm just old fashion and would've appreciated a conversation.,5
I had a great experience with Lendio,I was able to secure my ppp when our bank of many years failed to do so.,5
I would have given 5 stars,"It was very difficult to get a response from my ""dedicated"" agent. Additionally, my agent was switched multiple times throughout the process. Lastly, I was asked by multiple people to send additional information that was never uploaded to the portal. Therefore, weeks had past and I was told I had to submit the same documents I submitted to my agents multiple times. Communication could be much better.",4
Took a long time but they got it done…,Thank you for helping my business,4

You made the process very easy and…,"Lendio came through for me twice in a big way. Given the current situation, the health crisis, and the ever changing guidelines...I truly believe that I picked the best company to help me not only once but twice. Lendio contacted me or answered my questions generally within 24hours. Given the size and the volume of work thrown their way I have to say they were nothing short of an Excellent rating.

I felt that I was on a team trying to…,"It's the worst company I've ever had in America.

My SBA PPPLoan was processed efficiently and approved shortly thereafter.  Many Thanks to the Lendio Team!",5
I couldn't have accomplished this…,"My experience with Lendio was five stars because of our Small Business Loan Agent, Bianca Jones. Hi, Bianca. She assisted me and my husband with the PPP loans for our businesses. The money makes a difference to us, but Bianca also made a difference - she was kind and patient and communicative and HUMAN in a process that can often feel impersonal.She deserves to be acknowledged for the excellent experience she created for us.",5
Amazing and quick service,Great service. They made the whole thing a breeze!,5
Fast service,Took a little while but it all worked out. Thanks Lendio for your time and efforts.,5
Easy company to work with,"I submitted my documentation for review back in January ‘21.  My initial experience was horrible.  My file was re-assigned to at least 6 different representatives that on different times would tell me my file was submitted and in great shape while months went by without ever even receiving my SBA number.  I reached out repeatedly by phone leaving messages and by sending email and nobody would return any of my notes.   At one point I finally got a rep to tell that my file had been denied and to go elsewhere.  2 days later, I took another call from a rep that said my file was not cancelled, in good shape, and would now be prioritized.  Weeks after that I still did not have an SBA number issued.  It wasn’t until I received an email notification telling me my file was being cancelled because I hadn’t checked into the portal for a while was the final straw.  I called the 800 number on the bottom of the cancellation email and somehow found my way to Ismael Pellot who  re-assigned my file to Ready Cap Lending.  From this point forward, I don’t have anything bad to say about the process and ultimately Lendio came through and helped up secure the funding we desperately needed.  It sucks that I was drug through the mud in silent treatment for over 2 months to get to this point.  My owners point blank told me to “stop trying.  It just isn’t going to happen”. Ismael and Catherine earned every bit of my 3 rating and I am thankful to them!!! Lendio had a 0 rating going before they stepped in and saved the day!!!",5
The Lendio team was responsive and…,"I appreciate all the help, great customer service !!!",5

All staff from Lendio works real hard…,"Lendio was very, very easy to use to complete the application and in the first part of the process extremely responsive. As the process continued, it became more and more difficult to interact with anyone through any communication modality. A video explaining the process was released that was helpful and able to calm our nerves as we had no idea if Lendio was needing additional information from us or not. The shut off to companies with more than 20 employees was right in the middle of our process, so we did not expect immediate responses to our inquiries due to the demand we recognized Lendio was experiencing. But, getting no response at all was very frustrating. In the end, we did receive a PPP loan and are very grateful to have had to opportunity to participate in the program.",5
Two for two on the PPP loans,They are great at assisting you thru the loan process. Lendio got my loan approved in a stress free time. Myself being a Black man was turned down countlessly by different banks but Lendio connected my business with the right Bank and got my business the much needed capital to keep it moving ahead. I would personally recommend Lendio to everyone whom is looking for a business loan.,5

Good,"It was a great experience to work with Lendio during this period in our business. We suffered a great set back because of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Lendio was extremely thorough and professional and provided all the needed support from beginning to end. Through their interactive platform you can talk with a Counselor and monitor the progress of your application in real times. The application process is simple and not complicated to understand.

My loan took 9 weeks, but should have been completed in 6 weeks.No one updated me about Ready Capital as a partner or affliation, or that I should be expecting them to contact me. So my Funds sat for an extra 2 weeks. I emailed and called to get updates with no results. I called in and was told my loan was going no where but instead their system had a flaw showing I submitted 2 different application when they ask to submit additional info, it generated another application and held up the process.Long story short. We finally got some help after I called  READY CAPITAL"", They said they were just waiting for us to sign papers. So we finally got our funds. After a few more days of delay and clarification.

Great thanks,"I was definitely not certain how Lendio was going to pull through for me on PPP funding.  But, oh my... I was totally wrong.  Lendio had me funded so fast I couldn't belie it!  Representatives were super courteous and excellent.  They got back to me on questions in seconds.  I am ready to apply my 2nd draw with Lendio of course!  I just need to wait till my first draw sba numbers are recorded and settled with funding company.  I have no doubt again Lendio will help me get 2nd draw in no time !!   Thank you Lendio !!!!",4

Thank you Courney for guiding me…,I applied for my 1st draw of ppp loan application through lendio. Lendio has sent me to the ready capital the affiliated lender I’m not happy with the ready capital services regarding on my ppp application process they are slow not following up on time sending me same emails twice for the same request I’m still waiting to get my second ppp draw funding from them but still no response as I was expecting... however I honestly don’t know how lendio process works I got ready capital and my expirence with them is quiet disappointing me..,5
It was very helpful great service,Fast and easy application process. Received the funds I needed to keep my business open until things pick back up.,5
Excellent communication,Lendio was so very helpful in communicative through the process~ when I filled something out that was in conflict with what I filled out with my first loan application if they got back to me right away and worked through the problem with me.

Jamar was so helpful and honest!,Very good services with lots of professionalism,5
Use Lendio for your PPP process!,There appears to be lots of automated messaging on the platform. I was constantly asked and re-asked for things that i had already completed or provided. So you end up in this endless cycle of confusion as to whether or not you need to do anything. Also reps were unresponsive when you replied to their emails.,5
Laura B,This was a simple process on my end. I had help with any questions I had. It only took a few minutes and done in a week or so I had the money,5

I was wrong the Team was very helpful and knowledgeable kept in touch whenever there was missing information. I had a few issues but Lendio Representatives assure me that everything was under control. There was times I wanted to withdrew but the Team assured me they have to follow the guidelines for the approval. I got my funds when they said I would. I would recommend Lendio to Friends, Family and business owners.",5
Denver Perry was awesome!!!,"The Lendio platform was easy to use for the PPP process (and I had tried a different program first and it was very cumbersome). The person we worked with was helpful. I got my loan approved - so it worked!  My only criticism is that sometimes it took a while to get a response, but likely they were handling many applications at that time for the day after I started the process, news reports said that the PPP fund was running out of money.",5
Great service and fast processing.,I thank you all for your valuable work. Thank you for the money that you gave us in this difficult circumstance. I thank you from me and my family with all my heart.,5

All attempts to find our why, were ignored by all three contacts.  Emails and voice messages were never returned.  How do I know what qualified on PP #1, you now didn't feel qualified for PP#2?  When applying for forgiveness, that could be important.",5

Extraordinary,Lendio gave me the best customer experience and communication was outstanding. It was a pleasure working with the Lendio team and plan to continue to work with them in future.,5
Easy to work with,I had several issues along the way.  My loan took about 3 months.  I would try can call and no return call.  I would email and would not receive a response.  I eventually received an email stating since they had not heard from me for so long they were going to put my loan on hold.  I received this email after leaving 2 voicemails and sending 2 emails a few days prior to this.  I event responded to the email from customer support and received an auto response indicating they had received my email and would get back to me shortly.  Never heard from anyone lol.  I finally got an email from a very nice and helpful lady who took me to the next step the same day.  It took months to get someone that helped me in one day.,5
Thanks,Lendio made the application process very easy and streamlined. I thought it was going to be a very complicated process but everything went pretty smoothly.,5
Excellent faster service,"We did 2 PPP loans through them for our two companies. One went fine although it asked for different information after the application that should have just been asked for in the application.  The other one was terrible. Got the application approved and the SBA number right away. However after this we could never find what the status was, continuously reached out to the loan manager to never get a response, and called other customer service people to get nowhere. Eventually, did get it through and funded after over a month and a half. It was very frustrating.",5
You guys as a great team were awesome,"Lendio made the PPP lending process super easy and efficient. I was Apple to speak with someone whenever I had a question about the process and the end, they were able to get my loan funded. Great service!",5

But once it was received, they accepted it and now we wait (I’ve already received my first draw from Lendio. Great service).

This was a pretty painless process and…,"Representatives are not responsive. A company with a good idea poorly executed.Update 04/29/2021: Their response to my original comment above is a non-response and written merely to show readers that they were able to secure funding. In fact it took nearly four months, amidst mass confusion among their staff, phone calls ignored and not returned, and miscommunications almost weekly. Lendio is merely a middle man. And not a good one at that. Go direct.",5
It was fast,I was very surprised of how your team members were so helpful and that they reached out when i stalled my application.  My first lender did nothing to help and would not help at all.thank you .Christina Lesch Falik,5
Lendio’s app was easy to use and quick,"The only issue that I had was the time it took to go through the process. I submitted 3/2 and funded 4/23. Everytime the bank asked for a document I provided it and it just took a while. I was accepted by the SBA and it just took a long time for information to be verified and accepted by the bank. I am grateful to Lendio for the assistance and guidance in helping facillatate this loan process. Now, let's move on to forgiveness!Thank you for helping during this uncertain time.",5

I tried working with a different bank to get a PPP loan and it took weeks and weeks - only to be denied due to some mis-information because their forms were so complex.

Fast and friendly service.,"Today I experienced some truly exceptional customer service from a Lendio representative named Shelby Madsen. She first emailed me links to apply for my PPP Loan forgiveness. I thought my many questions about filling out a simple online form had to be annoying her. Never once did she make me feel that way. In fact, when I really did become stuck because of a problem on my computer, she called me and cheerfully, quickly solved the problem. She then stayed on the  phone until I had completed everything, leaving me with a secure feeling that it was now done, and done right. I'd hire Shelby in a second. She was great.",5
Very efficient for online transactions,Great service but I only received small amount of loan won’t cover my expenses Thank you,5

Highly recommend Lendio,Very courteous every simple step of the way! So great!,5
Great Company,"I signed the same 3 contracts over 6 weeks due to some problem that no-one could disclose to me.  Turns out that once the 1st draw finally funded, it was so late that I am not be able to apply for 2nd draw.  Maybe that was a coincidence, right?I believe that's 3 strikes, arguably 4.  Who's counting though? One star because the 1st draw finally funded.  Lendio almost elevated several stars here if I actually received an email to submit the 2nd draw, as their reply stated.  I never received any additional communication for submitting the 2nd draw.",5
Great experience,"What can I say? Nothing, but the fact that when everyone else was running us around Lendio saved our company from closing. Lendio is by far superior and more compassionate than any entity competitor. RetailProfessional& IT Services Inc will always be thankful for Lendio as they literally saved our company, our employees and our customers. We intend to share our experience and let all our society media connections know about what Lendio did for our company!",5
They were great to work with!,The staff worked with me thru the whole process... I will use lendio again in the future & referr to other businesses owners,5
Lendio was the 2nd lender I applied to,"The application process was fast and easy , what I didn't like was there is no assigned loan officer , you end up with an officer of the day every day... and get emails from so many people asking for documents and it caused me to be concerned until they clarified there process.",5
Got my PPP loan processed faster than…,Super easy process! I have heard other people and their horror stories regarding getting the PPP loan process. Lendio makes it easy with their one stop shop approach. Highly recommend,5
Not good at all,I found that the process was simple but everything was very much up in the air and it didn't feel like there was someone to get in touch with to answer any questions. The actual loan felt like I wasn't dealing with an actual company and at several points in time I felt like the company was not even real. It made me feel very insecure. The loan did go through but I would prefer more follow through.,1
Paycheck protection,"lendio was very responsive, quick and came by recommendation by a women's small business association I work with. The recommendation held true, they let me know each step of the way the status + process was clear + as easy as I think it could have been. This was my first loan (for pandemic support) and I was pretty intimidated going in, but coming out the other side, it wasn't overly complicated.",5

You guys was awesome 👏,"Worst experience. Use anyone else! I applied for my second round PPP in January and it’s now 4/27 and have yet to be funded. They keep asking for the same paperwork 5 times, they had an incorrect loan number, and just paperwork has been messed up in every way. Their customer service is the absolute worst-no one returns your calls or emails and they give you a different point person every time. It’s been a second job following up every day for months.",5
Lendio was great to work with,Great Job with PPP loans.  First Class Operation. Great Communication.,5

The total experience was excellent,"This has been challenging for us as a Home Health Care Agency. Our revenue decreased due to the Pandemic. Being a small agency, we continue to provide the best Quality Care to our patients with Skilled Nursing, Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy. Based on the decision of assisting the small businesses, Lendio came to our rescue, approving the loan and helped us to continue to keep our Home Care open, kept our Clinicians  and office staff working and to continue to keep our patients safe in their homes. Lendio kept us in the loop regarding the status of the application.  They were very professional and knowledgeable.  Thank You Lendio!",5

The experience with Lendio wasn't a bad…,Good follow up. It was pretty easy except every time I had a concern or question someone new was assigned to my case.,3
Great Company,"Getting funded took way too long for 2nd draw.  We did our 1st draw through AMEX, and it went very smoothly and very quickly.  AMEX referred 2nd draw folks to Lendio.  I started on the Lendio app 1/19.  I signed loan documents on 2/17 but was never funded.  I furnished Lendio everything under the sun as soon as it was requested; however, I kept getting emails that my loan was incomplete. Lendio also kept changing my funding manager.  I tried to apply with another lender; however, since we had an SBA loan number, I was not successful.  We finally got funded on 4/16.  I would never recommend Lendio to anyone.",5
Thoroughness of Care,"I give Lendio a 3 star rating because after many months, I was indeed funded through Ready Capital. The application process was difficult, with minimum communication. Then the two step security features were added to the login, making in extra difficult to get help with a live person. They switched representatives every other day and getting information was very difficult most of the time. Once my application was handed over to Ready Capital, it took about 10 days to go through basically the same process and then another 3 days to fund. Currently going through it all over again for the second round draw. Hopefully, it wont be has difficult because I am working directly with the lender now. It would have been more convenient if they offered the second round draw at the same time. I have uploaded the same documents several times. My guess is its a stalling method. Don't give up!",5
Great Service,I was great experience to work with you guys . Team was great and they called us for any information. And sen you email for everything. And was fast answering after any questions thank you for doing good job,5

Worked tirelessly and thoroughly....,"I was worried that the larger companies would deplete the funding allocation before the smaller businesses would be serviced. Thanks to Small Business Administration (SBA), and Lendio, my company qualified and benefited from the PPP program. During the first draw, time was running out and we almost missed the program's window to apply.  But, we met the qualifying criteria and was funded, which helped us to make it through the end of twenty twenty year. We also applied for the second draw, and again we received funds!  It's truly a blessing to have funding made available to continue to meet our financial obligations.  So, we want to thank the SBA's members and the Banks that operated in good faith.  Thank you!",5

Business partner for life!,My experience with Lendio was quick and easy. Stephanie did an amazing job responding punctually in order to make sure my application was completed and filed on time. Thank you!,5
Lendio made the whole process fast and…,"Great company, easy to work with. They complete everything in a timely manner.",5
Lendio made the process seamless and…,"I had an amazing experience on the phone today with Nichole J.!  She was so helpful, patient, and gave me an explanation in a way that i could finally understand from Lendio.  I have had many issues with my second round application through Lendio and gave her a call.  I cannot thank you enough for having someone on your team like Nichole.  I'm hoping you see how great she is and reward her for this positive review.",5
This really helped me out,"Lendio honestly dropped the ball on my initial PPP second draw application -- I think they were having trouble hiring and keeping good staff and keeping up with the influx of applications. BUT, once I got assigned to Paige Perez, she literally took my hand and walked me through the whole process. She was AMAZING and so communicative and made sure I had everything I needed to get approved. She was caring and kind and I really felt like she went above and beyond to help me out. Whatever y'all are paying Paige, it's not enough! She's your best employee (when literally everyone else I worked with dropped every ball on my case.) So I give Lendio like 3 stars and Paige Perez 10 stars!",5
Top notch service,MyLendio experience was 1st rate. I have nothing but good things to say about their determination and effort to get the job done. Again Thanks Lendio.,5
Lendio has been incredible to work…,Excellent service thanks for your help,5
good,"I HAVE NOT RECIEVED ALL OF MY FUNDS! That was a horrible reply Lendio and it’s NOT TRUE. I repeat: I DID NOT RECEIVE ALL OF MY FUNDS YET! One loan is STILL in limbo with barely any communication outside of the untrue reply Lendio has listed here. I have received less than 40% of my PPP Loan and the communication has nearly stopped. I’m not receiving any follow ups. Somehow, my loan was split into 2 loans and I received the lowest amount first, (of course). This lender has placed the blame on SBA with no specific details for almost 3 weeks now. I’m STUCK! With no one to talk to, explain, respond or assist in progressing forward. Khadijah Mohammed was very helpful in the beginning. Now, there is radio silence on the status or reasons for the delay. THIS IS HORRIBLE and my hands are tied. WHAT AN AWFUL POSITION TO BE IN!!!!",5
Thank you Lendio for making this…,"I received my PPP loan through Lendio/Customers Bank. When it was time to begin the forgiveness process, Liva Siufanua reached out to let me know she would be my contact for the process. While the process took some time (due to the bank and SBA, not Liva), Liva was incredibly transparent and responsive throughout the entire process which made things much less stressful than I had expected. She was great to work with, and I give her my highest review.",5
Best support ever,"The process of applying for the PPP was complicated and very fast moving. The best part of the whole process was that when I had a question about anything or needed to be informed of something, I had near immediate communication by email, text or phone call with Dana Loscalzo, the Document Validation Specialist assigned to me. Her knowledge and ability to clearly and quickly communicate with me gave me confidence that I completed the application completely and successfully. It took about 30 days from application to funding.",5
They are awesomeness,Support was on pointDeanna Fuller made it  smooth process!!!,5
Made the PPP Loan process extremely…,Speedy.　I like my agent.,5
Truly one of the best companies to work…,"Great ,reliable ,easy , clear process and responsive service",5

Thank you for your suport in these hard…,"Rosario Fernandez has been the best assessor that I could ever want, she has helped me with everything that I could possibly ask, to fill the applications.I can sincerely recommend her to anyone that needs to get any of the services that she can provide.",5
Good service,"Brady Schofield listened to and adhered to the needs of my company in regards to funding. He worked to get me the amount of funding, and terms that suits our circumstances. This is the second time that I have worked with Lendio for funding in the past year. The process was quick, precise, and easy. Thanks!",5
Awesome,Morgan L. was awesome in assisting me today via chat!!! She answered all of my questions and assured me that everything with my application was in process.,5
I'm hard to please but these guys did…,I'm very thankful and appreciate all your help and assistance in obtaining my PPP,5
I still have not received funds,"I obtained a PPP loan through Lendio. I first tried to go through my bank's fintech partner but this time my bank completely outsourced to that entity. It shall remain nameless but it had horrible follow-up and follow-through. Conversely, Lendio was an absolute dream to work with. In particular, one specialist, Dana Loscalzo, was so supportive. She went above and beyond to make sure to keep me updated when things weren't happening daily, to notify me when the actual funding lender was identified (this was in addition to the email directly from the lender and the Lendio automated emails), and more. She was amazing!I'd never used Lendio before but I will DEFINITELY use them again. So many fintech firms are so swamped with the PPP that their customer service has gone out the window - no phone calls and weeks-delayed email responses. Against those comparisons, Lendio stands heads and shoulders above the rest. But even if others were responsive, Lendio would stand out. The customer service is just high touch. I felt like a high value client. Thank you!",1
"contact was good ,kept the ball rolling…",Venus is amazing. So helpful & supportive. I was lucky she got my file.,5
Lendio created a stress free customer…,"Process went smoothly, interaction was precise and professional. Thank you.",5
Very professional,"I was amazed and thankful for the opportunity to work with Jonathan Maxant of Lendio.  His expertise allowed for a quick, efficient, and much appreciated outcome.  I encourage reaching to Mr. Maxant and Lendio for any lending needs.",5
Lendio Came Through for Me,It was easy and fast to apply. The turnaround was quick. They answered all our questions.,5
My clients I referred to you are…,LENDIO is one of the best you can work with when it comes to lending . Hard working and loving staff,3
EXCELLENT REVIEW,I was supported for Lisa Blick and she was amazing. Honestly speaking I think she have played a very important role if I have been funded.Thank you so much Lisa Blick,5
Everything went great thank you,I worked with Terri During the process and she was so patient and amazing! Any questions or concerns I had throughout the process she helped me along the way.,5
The process started off a little slow,Rebecca Borsavage was a pleasure to work with. She was very helpful in following up and making sure the bank was well aware of any issues. I would recommend Lendio to my colleagues and friends.,5
Just wishing I can get my second draw…,Le dio was very helpful to me and handled things quickly.,5
You are there when I need it,Fast and professional services. Thanks for the great customer service in a time when the world is in need.,5
Fast,"Super easy to work with, great communication. They helped me with any questions I had.",5
Excellent Customer Service and follow…,Quick and efficient process.  Received a call about my application within 10 minutes and continued to receive follow up on funding.Lendio performed when my local banks couldn't be bothered.,5
I appreciate Lendio!,"I had a wonderful experience with Lendio, despite the constant rounds of submitting documents that confirm my business and identity with the SBA. My rep Karli Andrews was super responsive, called me back every time I called with a question, and was a great support system through what was an intimidating and daunting process. THANK YOU KARLI AND LENDIO!",5
Fast and easy what else can I say very…,They answered questions quickly and worked with my business even though it wasn't a normal business. My representative was working early morning hours - even before her company phone lines were on for the day - and I appreciated that.,4
Thank you I appreciate the help very…,"I was told the process would take a couple of weeks, I submitted it on March 2nd and did not receive until April 14th and was unable to contact by phone or email. I know that everyone was dealing with a lot of applications, but the login could provide a little more information about process. But over all I am very happy eveything was done once approved. Thank you",5
It was really very fast,It was very easy dealing with Lendio.  They kept me updated on the loan process and anything else that was needed.  They made sure that I understood that the process was safe and secure.  The money was deposited into my account within a week once I was approved.  I will certainly use them in the future.Pam,5
The process was very simple and easy…,"I have worked with several different companies in the process of applying for PPP Loans. Though Lendio was hard to get in touch with initially, once I connected with Deanna Fuller the customer service was outstanding. She is quick to respond and follows up with updates.",5
Awesome,"Caitlyn Christensen did very well, she was very much on top of me getting turned in to speed up the process",5
The process was fast and Accurate,U guys did your job but the bank hasn't issued funds yet,5
PPP loan,"I did not receive my full eligible amount. I applied for my PPP application with my gross income and I submit every documentation that needed. And I emailed them, called them, and messaged them yet didn't get any response. But Lendio did not really care about it. They only give me the amount out of my net income. It is such a bad experience applying PPP application here with Lendio. I am truly regrating.",5
Lendio gets 2 stars for getting my PPP…,excellent staff,2
Thank you,"It was great, but the communication could have been a little better. I kept reaching out via email, phone, text etc. to get clarity on final steps and I never received a response. If I didn't take a leap of faith and complete the final steps without guidance, I probably wouldn't have ever gotten the PPP despite being approved due to lack of follow up.",5
Smooth application process,There are two reasons I'm not giving 5 stars-- The process took quite a long time and Lendio kept changing the manager in charge of my account.  My company is in a unique situation that affected my ppp results greatly and it was a little challenging to keep bringing the new person up to speed on my unique situation.  I'm thrilled it all worked out in the end.  It was a way better experience than going though Bank of America (as I did for the 1st round).,5
Lendio is the best,The process was smooth.,5
Very helpful,you all change my account with seven different Manager and it took seven months just to get my first loan,5
I used 3 star because I got it but…,I was able to receive my ppp loan through lendio.They are very professional  and the case manger in charge of my application was very reliable.,3
TOTAL REVAMPED SERVICE FROM LAST YEAR!,"I would recommend Lindo to achieve getting you the PPP loan assistance. I was unable to get the PPP the first go round. A representative from Lindo keep kept following up with me and making sure all my paper work was entered on time and correct. So when the second round of funding is available i will be prepared. This service and communications was invaluable to me. I had representation from beginning to end in this process. Due to the assistance i received from Lindo, I was able to get my PPP on this second go round. Now they are assisting me in getting a SBA loan .",5

Great  with responding,Lendio was fast and very clear with the application.  I felt entirely comfortable during the process.  And most importantly they put me in position to be successful at obtaining the funds i needed.  Thanks Lendio!!,5
It was simple and easy to complete…,"Textbook case of terrible customer service. I initially called in to see if i should get a second PPP loan. I clearly shared my situation to clarify my eligibility and was ASSURED I should do it and would be approved. So i put in the hours required to do so. Then the insanity began. Over the last two months, I have called in 6 times, chatted in 4 times, was sent up the chain numerous times, and connected with my ""funding manager"" who changed from B____, R___, P_____, T______, L_____, C_____, and J____ (updated to S_____ today, by the way). All of them assured me that i should keep going and gave me advice for more work. No one reached out to let me know the status, i had to reach out every time.All in all i have put in over a dozen hours at their encouragement and suggestion. Then today happened. Loan denied due to the EXACT reason that I called to confirm in before i even applied. I get that I'm not a big business to them, but how little they cared about my time and passed me around and lead me on is a monumental lapse of training and professionalism. Would not and could not recommend them in any way.",5
Lendio for the Win,They have made applying for PPP loan very easy. Were always there when I needed support. Great communication. Thank you!,5

painless process,"The representatives that helped me with the process was very professional, patient and thoroughly with every step of the way. Remembering everyone names was a added benefit to be able to get in touch with.",5
Great service.,The second round of PPP was a chaotic time. And so we all got on the ride together and even though at times it was frustrating the end product is what ultimately matters. And I was able to secure funding I think because Lendio just kept grinding through applications even if they weren’t always available. Earth didn’t come with roads we had to build them.,4
Paige was great to work with.,"Lendio was excellent. I was worried about using an online company, but I could have several e-mails with the staff, and they got right back to me with answers to my questions. I had applied for PPP loans with several companies, and they were the only ones that I felt I could reach out to with any questions.",5

My number is +19495103351 3/16 was the last communication and you said it would fund in 10 days and it still has yet to fund and it has been almost 35 days. Furthermore readycap is suppose to be funding this and when we call they say that we have to call Lendio, Sad part is no one answers when I've tried to call on multiple occasions. A phone number to someone direct would be helpful.Thanks, Dr. Erin Hudson",5
Lendio was fast and organized,"It was a bit of a struggle to get someone to connect with us at the beginning stages, which created a lot of tension and anxiety around so many unknowns as a struggling small family business.

My experience has been extremely horrible, loan officer name is sarah flores, horrible communicator  I applied begining of Febrary for first round and the commincation is bad barley respond and now my loan had been fully cancelled without an explanation, this sucks because I want to apply for round 1 and 2 and here we are 3 months in with the back in forth and im over it, Im in the renovation business for rental properties and with the market with move outs and evictions I can use the captial, but who cares about the small business, definetly not lendio.

Thank you for your help,"My Lendio Funding Manager Karli Andrews is way more than just a Funding Manager! She is a ""mess organizer"", a ""go behind clean up magnet"", a ""hand holder"", a ""tear wiper"", a ""calmer in your storm"", a ""voice of reason"", and most of all, a ""kick butt-no matter the hour-christmas morning if need be-I will get it done"" type of AMAZEBALLS FUNDING MANAGER! No matter my frustration, cursing fits, or temper tantrums I threw her, from the chaos I was living, from the 10 previous ""funding managers"" that touched my application and totally screwed it up, Karli NEVER raised a bead of sweat on her forehead, never raised her voice, and worked through it all while constantly apologizing to me when I should have been the one to be apologizing to her for my ""On 10, I HATE YOU"" attitude! She is truly a Phenomenal Woman! A BOSS B...**! In ALL good senses of the word! She worked over and beyond for ME, MY EMPLOYEES, MY BUSINESS to get us the funding we need to get us back to work, and I am forever grateful!!!!! These sentiments goes out to her Rockstar Supervisor Samantha as well because she too went above and beyond for US!!!!! Blessings to them both and to Lendio for helping Small Business owners like me! If your business needs some funding, small or large, check out Lendio and I sure hope you get Karli!!!!!!",5
I had a good experience with Lendio,Excelent Company!  Great Communication! I highly recommend anyone trying to get the PPP to go through this company! All the staff were delightful. Thanks again!,5
Thankful:),Our business has been turned down for  a 2nd PPP loan by a big bank. We turned to Lendio. Justin is great. He helped walking us through the process and successfully secured the loan for our business.,5
Took 3 months to have finalized,"If I could give a 0 star, I would. I applied PPP round 2 through Lendio. My company is newly founded in 2019, starting business in the second half of 2019, and started issuing payroll in the last quarter of 2019. The business got hit bad by Covid in 2020 like many other companies. When I got the SBA contract, I found that SBA was mistakenly using 12 months to calculate my monthly payroll cost, which significantly reducing the loan amount. I immediately contacted Lendio, but got no reply after numerous phone, voice mail, and email. I do understand that everyone is working hard to go through this tough time together, and mistakes/errors are inevitable. However, the way Lendio handled my case was not professional, and I am not satisfied with the customer service at all. Had I known that, I would have chosen another broker for my PPP loan.Update:After I wrote this review, Lendio replied to me the same day that ""lenders are looking at your 12 months of payroll to validate the loan amount. ""This is non-sense. They don't even bother to read my post entirely and carefully.First of all, I stated very clearly, in the review, and my previous communication with Lendio, that my company was a new one in 2019, and the payroll amount was for just 3 month. I only gave them document for 3 month payroll of 2019, since that is all was available. Where can they ""look at 12 month payroll""?Secondly, during the application process, I did my best to reach out to Lendio for at least a whole week (email, phone, voice mail), but received no reply. Now Lendio came up a lame excuse, the very same day of my review, trying to cover it up as a PR campaign. Charming.Update2:This becomes very interesting. Right after I post the 1st update, I got another reply from Lendio: ""When calculating loan amounts, the lenders base the amount on the documents you provide.""I really don't know what they are talking about. Everything they say seems ""politically correct"", but it doesn't make any difference. I said very clearly, that I gave them 3 months payroll in 2019, and they treated it as 12 months payroll. The calculation was way off. I don't know what they are looking at.This is very simply. If you made a mistake, just admit it and clean up the mess. You should learn is from Kindergarten. Everyone makes mistakes, including myself. And I understand Lendio may be under pressure and could make mistakes during this difficult time. However, trying to cover that up just doesn't work and actually makes it worse.What is more, I even start to suspect that if Lendio's replies are from robots, not an actual person. During my application, Lendio kept telling me to contact them with any questions, but when I contacted them, either there was no reply, or an email that was totally unrelated to what I was asking. This time for my review, it is just impressive that they replied so fast and so not-to-the-point.Lendio, can you stop doing these non-sense? Can you have a real person call me to resolve it rather than reply these non-sense?",3

Thank you,very good over all there where moments of conflicting instructions on what was required i would be handled by one person and then when i went to contact them i was handled by someone else ( five people total ?)Amanda B is amazing,5
Customer services was prompt and…,Diligent in getting paperwork complete.  Highly recommend.,5
Thank you for this loan process was a…,"I will not be using Lendio for any services ever again. Some of the worst communication I have ever experienced.*Lendio reached out to me to apologize for the issues I experienced and tell me what they are doing to improve. I apppreciate this, and will consider them for future services based on their follow-up.",5
I am satisfied,"Excellent staff, been helpful throughout the whole process for PPP. Extremely grateful we chose lendio to help us with the process",4
Best and relabel Leander that helped me…,"Terrible experience. Used them for ppp loans. No communication during the process. Their actions resulted in me missing out on working with other loan companies and meant i received less than i was eligible due to impossibly difficult communications. Completely dropped the ball and the impact still being felt. Would actively dissuade anybody who is considering them and I will be looking at whether i have options to pursue legal remedies for their misrepresentation and mishandling of my loans.UPDATE: I got the exact reply you would expect from a company that IS NOT EVEN A LENDER, so had to update further as a cautionary tale!! Lendio took no time to review the specifics of my application - they aren't the Lender, so I guess why do they care? When the PPP rules changed, I was not given any opportunity to make changes - as an independent contractor, I was eligible to use a different line item on Sched C tax form for the PPP amount this year. When I requested to make changes, I was told that I would have to start my application again - not a big deal if the company you are working with is quick and seamless. In this case, I opted to stay the course due to the impossibly difficult time to get any communication. The ONLY reason I ended up with any funding was because I reached out directly to the Lender that was backing the loan, AGAINST LENDIO'S DIRECTION. If I had stuck by Lendio, I would still be waiting.Meanwhile - I also applied for a ppp for my 2nd business. That loan app fell through because the lender did not receive any of my documentation updates/constant communication from Lendio. Here's the point: IF you are seeking a loan GO DIRECT to the LENDER not to the middle man Lendio!",5
Fast and Friendly,Turned around fast than expected!  Great service with quick responses.,5
My experience,"My Lendio Agent Stephanie was excellent at help me process my PPP, she kept me on track and informed and advocated for me every step of the way. I am so thankful to her and this program I do not know what would have happen with out her.",4

Excellent service,"excellent service and friendly site to apply and follow great staff and great company ,will definitely recommend to my family and friends.",5
Very easy to work with,Poor communication. Did not give me the new amount with the SBA New guidelines even after I requested and updated my application.  Terrible company.,5
Very happy with all your help,I think Lendio did a terrible job as a broker of ppp loan for my company.  There were so many missteps and lies being told during the application and funding process.  It took over 3 months to get first ppp funded from application.  This is unacceptable and unwarranted. Lendio is incapable of handling ppp applications as a third party broker and should be banned from processing sba applications.  I share the frustration of many small business owners who had to waste time in followup of a simple application process. Bottom line is they aren’t organized or their staff is ill equipped to handle ppp applications.,5

President,Lendio are one of the best  companies they are fast and very helpful,5
Excellent service,The representatives were very nice and helpful the only thing I was told the entire process takes 2 weeks but ends up to almost 2 months,5
Thanks.,"I don’t really want to say anything negative; Lendio eventually got the job done and got me my PPP loan, for which I am extremely grateful! They are VERY hard to get in touch with and it was a very lengthy process, but when I did finally reach someone they were generally very helpful. In all, I think they have some kinks to work out but I understand they are probably far busier than usual with the PPP right now. They got me the loan, which is what counts!",4

Very helpful responsive operation,"Well, I don't know how many times they asked for the same documents like I did not send it the first time. Well actually the first time they asked for documentation it sounded more like a hey if you have these documents get them ready to send them as the lender may or may not ask for such documents. Then we got to the actual lender and they did ask for the same documents again.Very confused as to what Lendio actually did.",5

Everything went great,"From the time I submitted the initial paperwork to Lendio to the time the PPP funds were in our bank account was less than 10 days. That was amazingly fast. Also, there was a real person that called me from Lendio and followed up, something that is rare these days. The only constructive comment I would add, is that after Lendio told me that our paperwork was complete and that a lender had been assigned and would be contacting me by email, we never received that email. I made several calls and emails to Lendio letting them know that I did not receive an email from a lender. The Lendio representative did not offer to tell me the name of the assigned lender. Had I not inquired from the Lendio representative who that lender was, we would have never been funded. It was only after I went to that lender's webpage and called them, that I was able to proceed with the final paperwork.",5

Easy to use service and excellent…,"I have requested for this Lender to ""CANCEL"" my PPP loan with them and they have failed to do so. On April 16 I log onto the Lendio site to cancel my PPP app because I no longer wanted to do business with Lendio due to their unprofessionalism and I was unable via their site to cancel my app. So I called in for the supervisor by the name of ""Philip Wheel"" but he was Unavailable so a rep by the name of ""Michelle"" answered the phone and stated that she will send Mr. Wheel an email regarding the cancellation, but I have yet to hear back from Philip Wheel or from Lendio regarding my request to CANCEL.  I made a decision to CANCEL because the level of customer service experience with this company has been very unprofessional and exhausting. All I am asking is for the company to please cancel my App and send me confirmation to my email showing that my App has been canceled.",5
Lendio workers thank u,"My own large, terrible bank rejected my PPP application for incorrect reasons. About a month later, they sent me an email saying that they'd rejected it in error and were reviewing my application again. But no need, because I'd already been funded with the help of Lendio! Unlike my bank, Lendio staff contacted me immediately about any issues with my application. They then worked closely with me to make sure I had all the documents necessary. I've never had such good communication in this situation and felt like they were really fighting for me to get funded. A friend had recommended them to me after she was quickly funded and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to others!",5

Good job great service,"For both PPP disbursements Lendio did a good job keeping me in the loop, asking only what was necessary to be provided or answered, and was able to secure as much money as they could. I was frustrated by the time it took to fund our request,but I think that was more the bank’s issues/backlogs. All in all, a very good job. I hope they will be as efficient with the “forgiveness” aspect.",5

Bianca Jones - Excellent Customer Service,"Super responsive, answered all of our concerns",5
Great service,"Lendio was excellent throughout the process.  Their communication made the process very human, and allowed me to not worry as much; they provided updates before I could think to look them up myself.  It was a very refreshing process that I appreciated.  Some of the calls/ texts felt a bit excessive, however.  When there were no updates, I do not feel it necessary to be contacted.  Over all a GREAT experience.",5
Took a little while but it all worked…,The team members who worked with me were courteous and helpful.,5
Painful but grateful,"The good news is, I eventually got the funding for my PPP loan. Key word, EVENTUALLY. I started my application for my 2nd PPP Loan at the end of January 2021. I finally got funded in April after being on top of every document from the moment it was requested! The biggest frustration I had was their process. I started off with one rep, then when the initial paperwork was completed, I got a notice that the lender was looking for something else that wasn't listed in the required documents list that I was provided by the rep up front. So I attached the documents and emailed them immediately to that rep. Then, several days later, I was contacted by a new rep that said they were the person that was taking my application to the next step, and they needed to verify my address because I had recently moved. Sent that person proof of address, she told me she'd call me within 24 hours to update me on the status of my loan. 24, 48, 72 hours goes by, no call, no email from that rep...I call that rep's phone number, get sent to voicemail. Get an email from now a 3rd different person stating they needed something else now!! I said, OK, but who are you? ""I am the person that will be taking your loan through the next part of this process."" Ok, so once I send you these things I'll be ready to receive funds? ""YEP! And I'll put you on my notes to call within 24 hours to update you, just to make sure!"" 24, 48, 72 hours goes by... my patience starts to wear really thin... It's now the beginning of March, having started at the end of January... funds within 72 hours my ass!I try to contact that rep 3 separate times after waiting patiently 72 hours after I was told 24.... Get now ANOTHER NEW REP!!! At this point I'm furious. I should've had the same person from start to finish working with me so I didn't have to re-explain myself every time I got on the phone. This gentleman tells me, ""I'm the rep that will get you through the next part of this loan process and I see your loan looks good and is with the lender now. Please be patient as they process your funds to be sent to you."" I wait, and wait, and wait, and wait...Then I get an email from the SBA stating that my loan hasn't funded in the 20 day period necessary and my SBA number has now been terminated... Please remember, we're in the middle of a pandemic and my funds are extremely depleted and I'm COUNTING ON THIS MONEY TO KEEP MY BUSINESS ALIVE and it's not even that much!!! So I am furious at this point and try to call and email my latest rep, and all of a sudden I'm sent to a customer service general inbox. WHAT IN THE ABSOLUTE HELL IS GOING ON WITH THIS COMPANY is the only thought in my brain, quickly followed by AM I EVER GOING TO GET THIS LOAN???The only saving grace was that I was actually contacted via phone after stating my frustration to their customer service department in an email. Laura, a manager here, called me and looked at my situation and personally handled my application with a new lender from start to finish and I was funded within about 10 days.My question for Lendio is, why couldn't I have just had one single rep working with me from start to finish that could call me back like they said they would to keep me updated and give me the peace of mind I was looking for? Your process was atrocious and flat out inefficient. Whoever came up with the way to handle things has hopefully been re-trained and put into a different role that they are more suited for or is flipping burgers at a local fast food joint where their process and mentality of the assembly line actually fits and supports the business model. The only reason it's two stars instead of 1 is because I did at the end of all this get my loan. I would never work with Lendio in the future on something so critical to the lifeblood of my business.",3
Excellent customer service!!!,As with anything dealing with SBA issues arise.  Other service providers don’t give you the option to speak or interact with a person.  I made a mistake in signing Documents which I feared would put me in limbo. Instead Deseree reached out to me and kept on contact while new documents were issued.   Thank you.  I finally was funded,5
I appreciate all the help,Thank you so much for the ease and thorough process it was to apply for first round PPP.,5

Very helpful and friendly service.,"The second round of PPP was extremely difficult for me. I was with my big bank the first time around, and the second time through it just didn't work. Numbers, profiles were screwed up. I got kicked out twice. Nightmare.. at the time, the march 31 deadline was looming, so I turned to lendio. lendio itself was good from the start. Communication was there. The best part for me was my agent, Tiffany. we emailed a few times, she actually called me twice, which was huge. it gave me the feeling that she was working for me. Lendio's partner, whom i actually got the funds from, i wasn't as happy with them. too much automation. didn't seem genuine, some screw ups. Ultimately the job got done in three weeks start to finish. I was 9 weeks and failed at my bank, so overall, I have to say it was a good experience. Thank you lendio!",5

Getting funding was stressful…,It would have been 5 stars (they closed the deal after all) ..the only reason I gave 4 stars is because the communication of each stage of the process and what was expected and what would happen next could hav3 been better Graham,3
Satisfaction,Well informed and streamlined process. Informative website to track application process.,5
Very good,"Smooth, quick service that helped our small company to receive good support during the Covid-19. You can't expect the same level of attention from large banks, and they usually have outdated policies that won't maximize your interest. Thank you so much for the help!",5
Because it took a month to get my loan funded…,Virtually no person to person comunication.  I have important questions that have not been resolved and am very unhappy with Lendio's service.  Would not recomend this company.,3

The best it was easy and fast thanks…,It was stressful but Lendio staff was always there to answer questions and emails. All paperwork was well explained and the staff was knowledgeable and very helpful.,5
Your staff are very friendly,"It took three months, dozens of emails, and over 5 interventions by the referring loan agency before Lendio fixed its errors, recalculated the loan, referred the loan to another lender, and completed the loan.  They sent numerous blanket emails that called for unnecessary resubmissions, changed their online application three times in a the same number of weeks, and failed to return phone calls and emails for weeks at a time.  Their lending officers often seemed clueless, and their programming quality control seemed non-existent.",5
Excellent service,Everything went smoothly and money hit account. I appreciate you very much. The service was quick and fast!,5

It took like 3 weeks, but I know due to all the false applications last year that it was going to take a little time for verifications that all was accurate and I totally understand the wait. I got my loan and I greatly appreciate the accuracy and thoroughness you put in to insecure I was taken care of. Thanks Lendio.",5
I was having trouble uploading…,Lendio was fast and efficient. Whenever they need something for me to upload it was quick and easy!,5

The fund was a Godsend,Brendan's the best...Very patient and understanding when it came to informing me of my loans progress...I felt very much in the loop of everything!!,5
I have good experience,"We didn't apply for PPP funding on the first go-around, but with the uncertainty of what this pandemic and it's economic impact will continue to have, it was so wonderful to know we were approved and won't have to worry about finances - at least for this coming year.",5
Great and fast customer service,LEDIO IS LEGIT AMAZING. Andoni is the best employee! Give him a raise! He walked me through the whole process to finish my ppp application. I am so grateful so his help and to go through LENDIO. Wow. 11/10 would recommend for your ppp app. They are available to help in any way possible and are very very quick to reply! They have your best interest in mind which is hard to come by these days :) thank you LENDIO!,5
Highly recommended I really appreciate…,This process was extremely simple. I heard great things about Lendio and they lived up to the hype. Very simple and streamline process to get my PPP loan done! Thank you!!,5
The 5 star review speaks for itself,"I had a wonderful experience with Lendio. They helped my process my PPP loan quickly. Both customer service reps, on boarding and loan processing, were both very communicative Nad forthcoming about the process. Night and day from Wells Fargo. Thank you!",5
Absolutely professional people thank you,"The experience was great.  I was nervous, but the representatives reached out.",5
Thank you so much for helping my with…,"Although I had a very rough start with Lendio, once I was paired up with funding manager Hannah, the process moved very easily!",5
Appreciate all the help.,"If it were not for Sam Foreman at Lendio in Phoenix, AZ I would be looking for someone else to obtain a loan. I know you folks are busy but when you send an email requesting information and they include a call back phone and email addresses etc. then they need to respond or answer the phone. I called and left several messages - no call back.  I responded to several emails - with no reply. I finally contacted Sam Foreman (from a previous encounter) and Sam got it handled. It is rude and inconsiderate not to reply to a phone message or email. Like I said, I know you are busy, but, someone needs to respond to the client.",5
Believe,"I get very quick response in live chat thank you Morgan L,,and tbank you to Dave to help me from submitting my application untill approval i very satisfied thank you so much 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻",5
Good  service and fast!,Lendio processed my PPP loan and they were very timely and it was a smooth process! I couldn’t be happier during this difficult time.,5
Excellent thanks,The process went somewhat smoothly! I was told after signing the DocuSign that it would take 3 days to get funded but it took exactly 1 week to receive the funds and 4 days after Lendio emailed me that I got funded. Not sure if the delay were Lendio or the lender's fault!!!. The only complain I have is that there was no way to communicate with Lendio. I emailed them and left multiple voice messages on the funding manager's voice recorder but I never received any reply. Even from the person who emailed me Congratulations you are funded...the funds arrived 4 days later. I guess they were overwhelmed.,5
Great,excellent customer service,5
1sr draw PPP loan,"The process was quick and easy. Drew did a great job explaining everything in a way that was easy to understand. I turned everything in on Thursday, Drew called me Friday and gave me the options and the money was in my account Tuesday morning. Quick and easy. Thanks Drew for all your help.",5
I wasn't sure how the process would be...,"I had a second great transaction with Lendio.  Submitting my application was no problem.  It did take some time to get someone to look at it and that included my trying to track down a rep through a different avenue as my call wasn't answered by customer service.  I can only say great things about the representative that I ended up finding.  He walked our application through the process quickly and gave good suggestions and information.  He was reachable and kept in great contact with me.  He deserves 10 stars!  Our application was then approved by the SBA very quickly.  Coming back to documentation then took a bit longer than anticipated but once we were able to sign documents, funding was quick and easy.  Thank you again Lendio for Round 2!",5

The process was easy,"i appreciate the help with my PPP Loan. The biggest problem i had was the lack of communication. One person who handled my acct was excellent in letting me know by phone and e-mail, her name is Beth Pratt. I emailed other people who were handling my acct a couple of times to see what was going on and no response at all. Suddenly a over a month and a half later money showed up in my account with no information on the lender or where it came from. I tried to log back on my account to find out and all my info was gone! No loan number or anything. Hopefully I can figure it out before i need to file for forgiveness. Still scratching my head. I will think twice before i use Lendio again.",5
I bank with BBT and they offered PPP…,"Excellent service, I would definitely recommend their services.",5
Very fast funding,"Customer service was horrible. Their systems were consistently overwhelmed. Many times we could not connect with anyone via phone or online chat. We were passed from funding manager to funding manager with near zero contact with any of them. We received random, confusing emails from people at Lendio that we didn't know after not hearing from anyone for weeks. Then we would get no response.The site itself is glitchy, constantly making you click through your application to get to the status update - even after submitting. The handoff to the ultimate lender was painful and we are still receiving duplicate, outdated emails.You would never know their core business revolved around connecting lenders with borrowers. It seemed like the first time they had done anything like this.",5
Wry knowledgeable and helpful,I really appreciate you guys help . I do feel like it was long periods of time where there was no communication of any updates . It is always helpful to know where you stand in the process,5
Lendio did a good job with my…,Lendio did very splendid job on my application. You guys are the best,5

The Best in Communication and Service!!!,Great experience. Fast and done right,5
Lendio delivered,Bank with Wells Fargo but they failed twice to get us ppp relief. Lendio actually had agents to help us with the application to get it done whereas wells we couldn’t even discuss our application with anyone. Highly recommend lendio.,5
The process was user friendly,I had a hard time reviewing because there were some great things. The process was quick and fairly simple and we were funded. So for that 5 stars. But we needed help and once we called they returned a call but they had an error with our paperwork and to get them to answer a question in detail or return a call was horrible. There really just wasn’t any level of customer service and I felt completely stressed out by it as I was also busy doing taxes and sick at the same time,5
Wasted 2 months trying to get PPP from…,"Trusted Loan Agent;Helpful, and prompt assistant",5
Very fast  thanks,"Your website was very easy to use. There were people who responded to each email and provided a solution, whether it was something else that I had to do or connecting with the lender.It was a relatively painless experience (the pain being in the borrowing part) and I really appreciate your efforts on my behalf.Thank you!",5
Process was really fast,"Very please with everything thanks so much, you guys were very helpful and called back accordingly every single time",5
Happy and appreciate with Lendio,"The funds were not sent within 72 hours, it took longer, but everything else went well.",5
Owner,I was very pleased on how fast and pleasant everything went.  I would recommend you to others. Thank you again for all your help.,5
My PPP loan was approved quick.,"I’m so glad I came across Lendio, what a blessing. The whole process with my second draw PPP loan was easy and went very smoothly. Great customer service. My business account is with Bank of America and my application was cancelled twice by them. It was horrible and waste of time with Bank of America. You speak to different representative each time and the and you get conflicting answers with each call. With Lendio you deal with one representative and you’re assigned to one account manager who is in charge of your account. Communication is great and you’re not left hanging in the dark. By the way they even help you upload your documents with your application once you send it to them. Morgan was great in helping me with the application process. Would highly recommend this company. Thank you Lendio my loan got funded last week!!!!",5

Excellent service,"Great company, very professional. I recommend 10/10",5
Lendio was very good the agent assigned…,"Was paired with a subpar lender who appeared to fund me, but never actually did. They sent disputing communication about docs being signed and not signed. They said I was funded, but I was not. Tried to contact the lender, but didn’t get a response until I got an inside track on a contact from SBA and started leaving multiple messages about withdrawing my application. Only then did anyone bother to return communication. Tried to contact Lendio and no one would return my emails or texts for days. I had to withdraw my application and work to extract my application from the sketchy lender. Then Lendio had a different rep contact me as though nothing had happened. Nothing but bad to say about this company. Stay away.",5
Very satisfied and good communication,"Our business is very small and only a few years old. We spent an entire year trying to work through the PPP process. When we turned to Lendio, they made everything easy to understand. They swiftly guided us through, and we were funded in 2 week! Great experience!",5
thank you so much for the financial…,"I hate to ding Lendio because my first PPP (Celtic Bank as the underwriter) loan went seamlessly.  However, this time I was pared with Ready Capital and have nothing but frustrations. Like many others, I received my SBA loan number, and shortly after, signed my contract. Since then, I have sent my 2019 Federal tax return 3 times.  Ready Capital has ghosted me.  I have sent numerous emails, called multiple times (I get a message that states they are too busy to take my call and then hangs up).  I have even sent an email to their Chairman.  Soon my SBA number will expire.  I am getting my attorney involved if this is not resolved by the end of the week. Seems this may be a breach of contract.  I would give Lendio high marks, but for their partnership with Ready Capital.  Simply Unexceptable.",5
Terrible service,I love the fact that I was able to get any questions answered quickly.,1
The loan did go through,Good service and helpful staff,5
Lendio got me funded so quick I couldn't believe it!!,"Lendio was great and easy to work with.  Within a week, I was funded with our second PPP.  Their process was so smooth and very easy to check the status.  The agents were very responsive and it was way better than Wells Fargo-whose system did not upload my documents.  There is NO good communication from WF and they couldn't explain what happened.  After my PPP was approved by Lendio's lender, I received notice from WF my documents didn't load.  I would recommend anyone applying for a loan / government assistance such as the PPP, use Lendio!  Great service and professional.",5
Lendio was amazing!,They were generally good and responsive. I wish they would have communicated a bit more towards the end of the process. But I am glad I worked with them.,5
Excellent work,"Almost impossible to get a response, lender was unreachable",5
This only company who reacted my requests about help,I received funding quicker than I anticipated!,5
Funding was fast and smooth,"Excellent customer service, loan was processed super fast.  I love Lendio",5
Took a while,Overall the experience was average. There was a lot of back and forth and I was asked several times for the same documents. I was also asked for documents that did not pertain to my loan. I could hardly ever get someone on the phone to cut out the repetitive email exchanges and I had to work with two different funding managers. It was easy to apply and I ended up getting my loan but the middle part of the process was frustrating and subpar.,4

Fast and Easy,The best. Always there when you have a question.,5
Fast response and easy steps to follow,"Initially thought the process was going to be a breeze after filling out application and uploading documents on the super high-tech platform brought forth by Lendio. Very impressed. Then weeks went by and finally was contacted that the invoices uploaded for utility bills did not match the mailing address used on the application. Representative assigned to PPP loan was never available to talk to clear up, we finally found out how to fix address, went in to make changes after receiving more generic emails of how to correct. Changes even though visible were not saved and took 2 more weeks to correct. PPP loan eventually received was 60% of what was expected with no explanations provided. Had high hopes initially, a let down on execution.",5

Domanick's soft skills cannot be taught, they can only be inherent by nature. You have an amazing gentleman working for you!",5
Thanks for the great financial services…,"Well, I find it odd that I got an invite to review as I have not been funded. I was approved, sent to a lender (who has reserved my sba number thereby insuring that I can not go elsewhere for funding) signed loan documents, and now can't get a response from either company. I signed 2 weeks ago and have yet to receive funding. I reached out to lendio hoping that they would help me with lender and no response.In response to the response from LendioI was not approved on April 5th. I signed my loan paperwork (already approved) on the March 30th. I guess I should be glad to have gotten a response at all considering I havnt gotten any to any of the emails I have sent regarding this matter.Update 4/28/21I have still not had any communication from the lende other than them sending me yet another loan agreement to sign.  lendio said they would look into it but I have yet to hear back. Lendio has sent me several congratulatory emails for ""being funded"" but I have yet to receive funds. My account says funded with the SBA as well, so I have already been removed from other supplemental programs as a result, but I have zero funds and no idea when/if I will receive them. Choosing lendio to handle my PPP loan may be the worst business decision I have ever made and it may even end up costing me my business.",5

Excellent work,Lendio's team was very personable and professional. Using this platform was (for me) very simple and allowed me to focus on the day to day operations of my wine bar. It was evident that they were busy servicing a deluge of customers such as myself. I think I was placed with four or five different account managers through the process. That said I was always well cared for and my queries answered quickly.,5

Tiffany was very responsive and always…,Lendio was amazing and very helpful. The only reason I decided on 4-stars vs 5-stars is that their partner in funding the loan (Ready Capital) ended up having to send the SBA contract for digital signature twice over the span of nearly 2-weeks in between (due to a phone call verification being missed and not able to be re-done without re-sending the entire contract). Once the contract was signed it still took several additional days.I reached out to Lendio about the process and just for peace of mind that the loan would indeed be funded and provided that peace of mind and helped ensure that communication with Ready Capital was indeed progressing.,5
Lendio is the best.,It took awhile. But I’m happy that everything when through.,5
Communication could have been better…,Venus from Lendio was superb.  She walked us through everything we needed and followed up with us many times to help us get all the documents we needed for this loan.  She made it very easy for us to get our PPP Loan. She was a real person and Lendio is a real company!  We really appreciate the help and the helping hand to walk us through all the steps.  There was a real care factor and human element.  I like that in this day and age of the computer and serve-yourself-society!,5

I had several issues along the way,"my income in 2019 was more than 75 thousand and my loan approval was too low, I think my income document was not reviewed correctly",3
very streamlined,"The process itself was overall easy enough, but the lender requested items in phases instead of having the list of what would be required readily available so that it could be expedited. I subsequently had to reach out more than once to inquire why funding hadn't occurred, which was at each stage when additional documents would be requested (After the contract was already signed), which goes against the note indicating that as soon as the contract is signed, funding would take place in 72 hours. After I made contact to inquire and more documentation was requested, which took  more than one instance funding ended up being delayed by nearly three weeks after the contract was already signed.",5

Lendio is very professional and great…,At first I was a little bit hesitate to apply. Then I said what can it hurt I might as well apply. I then applied with Lendio on the website. I kept receiving emails so I started thinking this was a scam. I didn’t think that it was legit because I’ve never spoken to anyone all communication was done by email. They did keep me informed during the process. I am a small business owner who’s business was hurt by COVID. All of a sudden I received a email saying my loan was assigned and after signing my loan documents. My PPP loan was deposited into my business account. Thank you Lendio.

Answered all questions,"Every business the top priority is customer service. Customer service is what makes or breaks the business. Being somebody that works with the general public on a daily basis,The ultimate goal is to brand your business to a way that attracts other people. I want to first start off with stating that my experience started off horrible, I felt neglected and unimportant and for that reason I wanted to withdraw my application. The biggest turn off was the lack of communication . Communication is key when a client is unaware of what’s going on . I was very disappointed with my experience with Rob for that reason only. Until I spoke with Domanik my whole experience changed. Domanik gave me reinsurance ,compassion & taking complete ownership of the companies lack of responsibility. I wished I would’ve met Domanik from the very beginning so that my experience would’ve remained in good standings until the end. Thank you so much Domanik for making me feel important, Domanik customer service was  to perfection. Domanik came to work to get the job done we need more hard-working individuals like Domanik !",5

Sarah called me from Lendio within a day and we had a conversation about my needs and she explained the process. She would email me when she needed something and submitted my app quickly. Could not have been easier. I signed my loan docs and money was in my account within days. Very happy with Lendio.,5

We received help, phone calls and email follow ups from Lendio. I have found that even though the government said that the process should be easy-it is not and you do need help,  We have had family members deal with large banks and its been a nightmare. We also worked with another company during tthe first round of the PPP loan process and couldn't get through to anyone but a low level employee, that knew very little except to answer the phone.  Lendio at that time, gave us advise regarding our rights to the PPP loan and told us to keep calling them. The next go round we used Lendio and the lender that they referred us to was also very patient.  Thank you again-we really appreciate your service and time.",2

Thanks Lendio,"All in all an easy process. I was, however, contacted by multiple people from Lendio via email and phone calls who seemed to ask for same info as I had already submitted. All were helpful, there just seemed to be a lot of conversations that didn’t have to happen.",4
Easy to follow process good customer…,Everything was smooth and quick. Communication was frequent and immediate. Thank you for facilitating the process to get approved.,5
My experience with Lendio was great,"Rating Lendio one star is too high! Terrible customer service! An Easter egg hunt trying to figure out what “critical” documentation is missing. At one point I found out they were reading the wrong date in the SoS certification. Application was supposedly compete and with the lender. For reasons unknown to me, my PPP package gets passed from Dave McGuinness to Nicole Sprague. That opened a can of worms since she needs to review everything. Obviously not a smooth handoff. I'm still trying to determine between these two who is more incompetent! Right now it's a coin flip! I was invited to apply for the PPP via Lendio by The Hartford. What a mistake I made getting involved with this company!Reply that I was approved...BIG DEAL! You still suck!!!",5
Too many times to re-apply for just one…,Lot of back and forth and bad communication...,3
I Was very happy with the result as I…,"For the uninitiated in using computers (attaching documents, completion of application) like me, it took 2 weeks to complete as I had to start all over each time.Each time that I would ask for instruction or explanation, it would be appl is incomplete with no specific, or no confirmation until another committee review.I did not get notice of approval, but was elated to receive funding - so all isgood but what a frustrating process.",5
I found that I could not get a response…,"There were a lot of duplicate requests for information, calls from people who did not give accurate contact information so I couldn’t return the call, and follow up for information needed to complete the paperwork for the loan a week after the funds were in my account. This is a classic “the right hand doesn’t know what the left hand is doing”. The structure and processes your firm use need a revamp. I appreciate the funds and it was an annoying process getting there.",3
Thank you for helping us with our loan.,"I had a lot of going back and forth with this application. It took much longer than it should have taken. The end result was good, it was just a drawn out application.",5

Very impressed,"They were not helpful from the very start.  We could not get them to answer our questions or to let us know what was happening during the process.   It wasn't until we threatened to file a complaint with the SBA that we even started getting anyone to respond to the issues.  Apparently they had been receiving information back that they needed from the lender and not sharing that with us and fortunately, we already had an SBA loan number or it could have cost us our funds.  I would never use them again.  They are not professional and do not have their people trained to deal with the processes and procedures that are going on with SBA lending practices.",5

The last manager was the most helpful. But their UIUX isn't good. Was asked several times for the same info and I had to resend the same info. (Case in point about their UI, they don't have an inbox system on their site. Messages are single emails directly to your personal email and their emails don't have the typical prior emails for history. So you have to save every single message you receive from them.)Comparatively, I have acquaintances who applied through other platforms/sources and their PPP funding process took three weeks overall.",5

Having a Bad PPP experience with Lendio,"PPP loan , I have been dealing with Lendio since March 10th on a PPP loan and use the chat a lot to ask for updates. Its a hit or miss if the chat actually is helpful or accurate in what they are telling you. I can say Morgan L was by far the most knowledgably aware I have spoke to and the most helpful to date. Not sure if you can request people on the chat but if you could I would request him.",1

5 STARS ACROSS THE BOARD!!!,"The PPP loan process was fairly easy. Lendio was responsive during the application process when I had a question. I did not complete the application in one sitting because I had to get paperwork from my accountant. Before I completed the application Lendio representatives followed up. Once I submitted the application, Lendio representatives went silent on me when I inquired about the loan status. I began thinking that I may have given my information to a fraudulent company. I reached out to the Lendio representatives that followed up with me during the application process but no one ever emailed me back. I also called and left messages for them. I then went to the Lendio website and sent a message complaining of the silence and asking for a update. I received a emailed from a Lendio rep. apologizing and stating the application is under review. I emailed that person back, and never received a response. Weeks had passed and I then received a email from Legacy Bank asking me to sign the loan documents. I was reluctant because I never applied with Legacy only Lendio. After a few days, and Legacy email reminders, I then decided to review the documents and honestly was on the defense thinking this might be part of the Lendio fraud. The documents seamed straight forward and harmless so I e-signed. After e-signing Legacy said I would see the bank deposit within 3-days. It did arrive as stated. To sum up my experience with Lendio, I'd give them a 5 star rating on the application process, and a 0 on the status  update process. I hope this feedback results in process changes so other potential borrowers get a little better service.4/12 update- A representative from Lendio called me apologizing for the miscommunication, explaining because of the PPP loan volume applications Lendio has hired temps to keep up with the work load. He explained these temps should have communicated with me on the status of my loan. He did say Lendio was going to review my experience with the representative that was handling my account so that they provide better service. I had some questions about the loan forgiveness process, and he assured me a loan forgiveness office would call me to discuss. Once I hung up the phone, sure enough the loan forgiveness office immediately called explaining the process to me. I'm happy to report Lendio does take their customer service very serious and has been very polite and apologetic. Although I had issue with communications, the Lendio loan process was very easy. I am happy to report Lendio is a quality organization, I recommend them to others.",5

If I had any questions I could  actually talked to a person and get a hold of them quickly . In all  it was a great experience working with them,5
It was very easy dealing with Lendio,It's quick and great!,5
Excellent process -,Online tools and process very easy and efficient. Would appreciate more communication from lendio team along the way.,5
PPP Loan Applications,The service was very responsive and quick glad I applied here!,5
Caitlyn Christensen did very well,"It was the worst experience, everything started at the  beginning of January finally ended beginning of April,not because Lendio was able to complete the process but because I was able to find the information from the bank that was going to lend the money, and they had to contact Lendio to  put pressure to actually fix the issue that was holding my application. For no reason I would recommend them to anyone.",5
U guys did your job but the bank hasn't…,"4/27/21I canceled my application with Lendio, submitted my application with my First PPP lender and it has already been submitted to the SBA for review.  No need to wait.  I recommend applying directly with banks and not with service agents.4/23/01After speaking to Mr. Pellot, my application went backwards, not forwards.  I was placed in compliance review and then assigned a new representative AGAIN.  I reached out to them by email and I only received a response from the representative once with an ""I will get back to you."". That' it!  I sent them an email to cancel my application.  Fortunately, the lender that issued my first PPP reached out to me letting me know that they are now processing second PPP draws.  ____________________ I'm updating to a three because your representative, Ishmael Pellot, personally reached out to me.  He was transparent and honest, fixed some items that needed to be fixed in the system and assured me the next steps should flow smoothly unless the banks require more documentation.  I will definitely update to a five of I can get my funding sooner than later.-------------After the portal informed that the application was sent to the Lender, now I am getting an email from ANOTHER representative that they could only validate to a lower amount of the loan?  What the hell?  I have been at this for over two months after being transferred to at least four other representatives.  Bad bad business organization.",5
I did not receive my full eligible…,"Lendio is a disaster, I wish I could give negative star rating?",1
great service,They were great kept me informed until the app went to the bank and since I've been unable to reach anyone or have them return my calls . My loan was for a larger amount in contract than they sent me and iam unsure how to go about thiß,5
"It was good, but customer service/support could be improved",You’ve done great work,4
There are two reasons I'm not giving 5…,"I must say, my initial representative at Lendio was persistent in overseeing my application. She ensured I addressed accurate documents were uploaded and communicated consistently until the process was completed. But greater than this is the fact that I could feel this woman cared about the outcome of my business! The rules continued to change around PPP loans as President Biden sought to ensure the small businesses of America received a bit more. My representative made sure the adjustments were made on my gross versus net to help my company float and rise. This is no ordinary thing to ‘feel’ loan reps care. Texting, emailing and replying to my voicemails, Billie went the extra mile! Bravo!! To the second representative passed the first phase, he too did a great job and getting my application across the finish line! Once t’s were crossed and i’s dotted, the bank in which I received the loan quickly completed the PPP loan process!",4
PPP loan,"While I was able to get my loans it was by far the most disorganized company I've ever dealt with and I would never work with them again! There was one amazing rep, Catherine Schnock, but the rest never got back to me and my application must have been passed to 20 different funding reps as they hired and fired incompetent staff.  I understand these are crazy times but the lack of customer service and clarity was beyond belief.  I'm giving them 2 stars because after 100's of calls and emails I was able to get the funding.  My giess is this review never sees the light of day but I hope management recognizes what star Catherine is and advances her to management where she belongs.",5
you all change my account with seven…,"Excellent service.  Chris Randall is very prompt, helpful and professional.  We really appreciate Lendio's good work, especially Chris Randall's.Just a little bit unclear on the website at first.",4

I was very pleased with the whole…,Absolute BEST experience working with a major lending service. Lendio TRULY cares about the small business owner. They communicate on all levels of the application process both via live agent or email. The process was smooth and efficient and I honestly feel more lenders should adopt Lendios practices. I will continue to work with Lendio and utilize more of there services because they CARE.,5
Swiftly work,It wasn't good experienceI applied 2nd ppp loan right before New regulation was implantI emailed how we can reapply ?They said don't need do anythingThey will follow upIt didn't happenSba funded my 2 nd ppp loan with old regulation .How do you want me to write better review?I got to be honest Sorry your company made a mass ...,4
I had excellent service from Lendio and…,The representative was very helpful and very knowledgeable while understanding Joe busy Lendio is he didn’t remind me of it he reminded me that they were doing everything they could do and even request that my loan documents be sent over personally if that could help speed the process up of signing loan documents: Thanks so much,5
Friendly service during my loan process,Great work Lendio in obtaining my PPP loan!,5
they were slow to respond,"The entire process was easy, quick, and efficient but the only draw back was the calculated amount per SBA guidelines was reduced without explanation. I am hesitant to file for my PPP2 through Lendio. Although I have many clients who have used the service and , again, it was easy, quick, and numbers were as originally calculated.",2
Will do business with again,"It was touch and go with no one answering emails and calls weren’t answered.  Then once funded, the money came from a different source altogether and I was never advised of that.  Now it’s time to apply the money and it’s a whole different company asking me to link my bank account and use their APP.  WTH!!??!!",5
Awesome easy smooth,"Total game changer to help my business stay open. Professional, quick and responsive. Thank again.",5
One super happy customer,The whole process was smooth Thank you,5
Great company really saved my business…,Took forever to get a loan. The agent in charge originally basically never responded. Someone replaced her. Then pretty much no one helps out with the loan. They just let it be. I had to be 100% proactive and do it myself.,5

Everything was so easy,"Great experience... Michael Boselli helped me to get my PPP loan from beginning to end the process was easy and painless, he responded all my emails the same same day I send them and guided me to get the most benefits possible, over all it took only a few weeks and after approved I got funded with in 5 days... I recommend Lendio to all my friends.",5
Excellent service,"Lendio did an excellent job in helping us obtain our PPP loan. They responsive, helpful and had our loan funded to us in about 1 week. We are very happy with the service and timeliness they gave us. I would highly recommend  them to anyone.",5
10 STARS!!!,Honestly was shocked how easy and simple things were using Lendio. Amazing service and had their people reaching out to me constantly to update me on the process. Many people talk badly about them and their lenders but I honestly can say it was quick and easy and I got my loan in about 2 weeks. I know there’s a lot of negative reviews but I cannot disagree more,5
Happy with the service I got from Lendio,"It took way too long. Much longer than the last time just going through Benworth alone.  It seemed as though the right hand didn't know what the left hand was doing.  Had to follow up with them so many times and then different people would take over, but then drop the ball.  Poor Poor Service!  Had to question the funding as it said to pay it back w/ 1%... it's a PPP so there is no need for paypack.  They agreed but apparently that's how their system is set up.",5
Lendio was fast and very clear with the…,Very Professional,5
Textbook case of terrible customer service,"There is no way to access those documents now. How come you respond to a negative reviews instantly, but you wont respond to 40 emails asking for information?I have sent 30-40 emails over the past 45 days trying to find out who is servicing my loan and have not received 1 response from Lendio.",1
"Easy Process, Great Service!",Lendio helped me through my loan process so quick and effortlessly!

"The representatives that helped me with was Brittany, Hector,","I filled the forms and within a few weeks the money was credited in mu account, no hussle",5
worked through crazy times,My name is Kelvin Belin and I have been waiting on my deposit April 1st and today April 8th it has been 5 business days. I have jobs to do and putting them on delay due the hold on my deposit b/c I need to buy supplies. I am going to have to draw my account in the negative to go do my jobs. I am blessed to be approved but knowing that blue vine last year when I signed my docusign documents the funds were already  deposited the same day. Can't get in contact with anyone from lendio to get any actions done.,5
Lendio was excellent,It was a good experience. I would say to have all of your documents in order. The agent will ask you more then twice for something. However they where very kind and helped me through the process.,5
Lendio was very helpful in getting our…,"Lendio has gone the extra mile to make sure both of our PPP loans have been funded. In order to relieve some of the stress associated with applying for a loan, they followed up with us on a regular basis to let us know where our loan was in the process.Their staff is efficient, detail orientated and professional. We couldn't be more pleased with the outcome or recommend them more!",5
Fast and easy process!!!,Very responsible and very easy going people with lots of experience and a very great sense of humor,5

Zak is the best,Lendio was very helpful in getting my loans processed.  Due to the structure of the business it was a little more complicated but they helped me work through it!!,5
Amazing company,I cannot say enough about Lendio and how they handled my SBA loan. My Representative Kendall Chantille went above and beyond her duties in helping me secure my loan. I honestly have not had better service and communication from any other service I have used in months and months. Thank you Lendio for caring and for your excellent service. I would recommend Lendio to anyone looking to secure their PPP loan.,5

Lendio was easy and user-friendly!,"Excellent,  peoples and company,  preferable to friends.",5
Great team they went above and beyond…,I was really surprised when I got the money thought I wasn’t gonna get approved,5
The gold standard for service,"Performance of Lendio is that overall they did a great job.  I think that they could use some better coordination in sharing information with the payee.For instance, they kept telling me that they had sent the contract, but failed to tell me the email that they had sent it to.  Had I known which email, the delay could have been shortened.",5
Awesome,I am very happy with Lendio Team. The specialist are very helpful. I got my SBA PPP loan in 2 weeks. Thank you Lendio Team.,5
thank you for your help it's a lot to…,The teams at Realta Solutions & LendioDenver were awesome to work with! They were very thorough in their explanation of items that I was required to submit.

Great Service,Thank you so much Lendio!Our family business is so happy and eternaly grateful for you help and support with the PPP application and process.,5
i was a hard task but help and all…,Absolutely amazing service!! I really enjoyed it and they made the process super easy.,4
Lendio processed my  loan quickly and…,I was approved for my PPP loan 6 weeks ago and signed all documents and as of today I haven't received the funds on my account.  Ready Capital Bank and Lendio don't care about my requests for updates and the simply stopped replying to me. They both are the worst and don't care about their customers. My funding manager Shayne Gillespie has also stopped answering to me.,5
Will use them over and over again they…,Loan application process was very easy and customer service was superb.,5
I have been very happy with the process…,Very fast process. Thank you.,5

The process was effortless and they did…,Lendio offered excellent customer service. Very knowledgeable on PPP application and quick turn-a-round time from start to finish.,5
Excellent,"The process was so  unorganized. It went from desk to desk and no one calls you back.  I had to upload the same information over  and over.   Finally after 9 weeks , my application  was sent to the matched lender. But I only found this out by calling lendio and finally talking to my account manager.  I found out who the bank was and called them myself.  They escalated my application and kept me informed      They had to call Lendio 3 times to finally get it released to them.  The bank I was matched to was able to get the funds to me in a few days.   They were amazing!",5
Excellent service!!!!,Took all the troubles out of my PPP application.  Replied to all emails very quickly.,5
This loan is much appreciated and was…thank you Lendio,"My first loan experience (with Kabbage) was terrible, with their incompetence leading to the cancellation of my loan before I could get funding in the first round of PPP. With the extension of the program I tried Lendio and the difference was night and day. I had a dedicated person who called and checked in and helped guide me through the ever-changing process until I was matched with a lender. Everything went smoothly, my business got the loan, and it saved us in a difficult time. Lendio was excellent and I've recommended them so many times in recent months.",5
Horrible with communication,The process with lendio was excellent from the beginning to the funds was place in your account,1
Excellent services.,I really enjoyed the conversation with Dominick. He was very professional as he explained everything very well. He did his best to try to expedite the situation of the DocuSign issue for us.  It was a pleasure. By far one of the best customer service experiences I've had in a long time.,5
Catherine deserves FIVE stars for customer service,"I had tried using BofA but ""they"" insisted I use another lender.  They (BofA) fumbled so badly with forms, sending extra documents, confusion and many other things, they were so unprofessional.  But when I used Lendio, I almost laughed how easy it was compared to BofA.  You guys kept me posted even when there was a hick-up in emails I was quickly emailed back to reconfirm the error and everything went smoothly afterwards.  I would defiantly tell somebody about the excellent service you provided, as was told to me by another collogue in my profession.Thank You very much Lendio!",3
Exceptional People,"I was assisted by Sam.What a great service and care with the customer.Thank you,",5
It felt very good working with Lendio,Great service!! Will definitely be using lendio again for my second draw. Thanks again for the wonderful service!!,5
I am pleased with Lendio,"Very good company, funding was really fast once approved! I would recommend them definitely.",5
Yay!,Did a great job very helpful and professional,5
I highly recommend avoiding Lendio for…,"Unfortunately, the only positive thing I can say about my experience with Lendio is that I did get funded on my PPP loan with SBA. Despite innumerable efforts on my part to determine the status of my loan. I was never provided any feedback from the many different representatives who they listed as being assigned to my case. I therefore was never confident or assured from Lendio that my application would be accepted by SBA and was only from my direct contact with SBA that I even knew that my loan was being reviewed by them. As an example, when I was informed that there was a discrepancy in my routing and account number from my bank that I listed in the application and that it didn't match with my voided check, I was left purely on my own to resolve the matter and at no point despite my repeated efforts was I ever given any assurance that it was resolved until I finally got funded. In short, there was zero response to my inquiries and therefore no customer service that I received on my account from Lendio. I was therefore always frustrated and uncertain about the eventual outcome of my application until the final funding.",1
I felt like I had a team working with…,Michael was very helpful and was able to clarify any confusion I had. Thank you!,5

My Lendio Funding Manager is AMAZEBALLS!!!,"I had an amazing experience with LENDIO, it was easy,  simply & I got my money less than 14 days. I'll recommend thousands of people to you guys. Once again, Thank's for helping me get my business off the ground.",5
Excelent Company,Lendio was very helpful and very prompt in helping me. They made the process very easy and were always available to answer my questions.,5
Big Bank turned down,"I have been recomending Lendio to all my clients with their business loan needs. Lendio is professional and fast. I am very impresssed. When so many local banks stopped taking applications, Lendio came to the rescue.",5

Terrible experience,Overall it was a good experience however there was numerous glitches signing into my account . Each time while signing in I needed to change passwords and it would not allow me to sign in from my desktop so eventually all correspondences had to be made on my mobile devise . Ultimately I received funding but a bit nerve racking . Also I never received a response from several phones calls I made .,1
Turned around fast than expected,My experience with Lendio was fantastic. Less than three days from application to lender and funding. I would highly recommend their services.,5
My Lendio Agent Stephanie was excellent…,"Marc Grant at Lendio is great!  Our application for the PPP financing was bogged down with another lender for seven weeks and that lender telephone numbers for service was unreachable. Mr. Grant listed his phone number and answers the phone, contrary to everyone else. Mr. Grant assisted me in canceling my application with one lender so that I can continue my application with Lendio would approve approve my loan in two days After waiting seven weeks with the other lender. Mr. Grant and Lendio is the person to call if you want your PPP loan and days and not months.",5
Excellent service.,"At first I had a lot of problems. I started with a Jeff, then it went to Alyssa, Justeen and the last person was a Caylee. Fact is they did it finally and for that I am thankful.

Great Job Lendio!,"I honestly believe that I would not have been able to manage the process of obtaining a PPP loan without the assistance of Lendio. Trying to work directly with my bank proved useless. Even when I ran into difficulties because of a mistake I made in processing the loan documents, the staff at Lendio continued to work with me and with the lender until the process was completed. I especially appreciated the fact that they kept in contact with me via email so that I always knew where I was in the process. I have encouraged other people I know who are eligible to apply for PPP to do so with Lendio.  I have nothing but good things to say about my experience with them.",5

Great job in the end!,Lendio has failed to release funds after 20 days. Today is my 20th day since receiving a SBA loan number. The past few days I have reached out to have my sba loan number withdrawn with lendio. I have not received a response from customer support. I completed a review last week on here and no one has yet to reach out and try to help me but they respond to all the good reviews and a handful of bad reviews. I would like the SBA loan withdrawn IMMEDIATELY from Lendio. It's been 20 days and I have no idea who the lender is. Horrible company to work with. don't waste your time. Im planning to file complaints within your states BBB after I finish this review as well.,5

Fantastic Customer Service!,"I recently applied for my second round PPP loan. My first round experience was rough! I SO LUCKED OUT with my loan agent Alyssa Brandt on the second round. Through the pandemic it hasn't mattered what company, what person or what process it has all been a nightmare. During this second round Alyssa not only actually cared about myself and my business, she understood the urgency of the situation. She called me several times. She emailed me several times to keep me informed or when something was needed then insisted on staying on the phone to make sure everything on her end looked completed and updated. Throughout this entire year this girl has been THE ONLY person or company that I got off the phone (or email) feeling good and as if something said was actually in process and going to happen. If you can find somebody better than Alyssa congrats because she is the absolute best! I so appreciate you Alyssa.",5
Very helpful and trust,Great service and got regular status updates through out the process.,5

"PPP was funded thanks guys, but I’m waiting for marketplace loan still in review",I’d like to start off by saying I was a little nervous applying for my 1st PPP. It has been a rough year and I needed the help. I am super happy with the fact I chose Lendio. Stephanie Hunnicutt was amazing. She was very helpful very responsive and assured me we would get through this process quickly. The best part of it all was how accurate she was in her gathering of docs. She did not want me to keep getting the run around and I like that. Do it right the first time won’t be a second! Good job Lendio I will definitely recommend!!!,5
Fast,I had a great experience. Always keeping me up to date with the process.,5
I have been very satisfied with the…,"Great service quick, friendly and easy",5
Venus has been extremely nice,I guess all My ducks where in a row . My associates have had nothing but the worst experience. After signing loan docs thinking they are approved. The then get emails asking for more documents. We would assume Lendio would gather that information be for sourcing a lender . Very confusing I say be patient it does takes 2 months . You should not ask people to sign loan documents before they are actually approved . This review is for the team .,5
Our contact at Lendio was Michael Boselli.,They were very fast on my turnaround for my second round of PPP. I would definitely refer them to anyone I needs fast services,5
Best PPP loan provider hands down,Super smooth process from beginning to end. Thank you!,5
Steve and Micah were GREAT,Michael Greenaway was very patient with me to assist in helping me correct problems with my PPP loan application! I would recommend his customer support relations!,5
Venus Donahue was born to be awesome,"I'm very disappointed with the loan application process. I originally completed my PPP application in January, and it's early April and I'm still waiting for information. Communication has been poor and my emails and phone calls have mostly gone unanswered. Today I tried to submit a help ticket and the web contact form is broken. I'm not confident at all that Lendio will be able to process my file and get funding approved for my business. But I've wasted months already and it may be too late to withdraw my application and start over elsewhere.Re: Reply from LendioNo, that's not correct that you were waiting on a response from me. My application was first marked complete at the end of January. An internal issue at Lendio is causing my application to be flagged as incomplete even though I've followed up with MULTIPLE people who have CONFIRMED that it is complete. I'm trying to be as proactive as possible, calling and emailing your office at least every week. But my application is still not moving and seems no closer to reaching the funding stage.",5
They came through for me and my business,Lendio found a bank for our PPP loan within one week.It was an easy process and the funds were in our account within a week.,5
The process was easy and the service…,"Lendio has assisted me for almost a year on two loans.  I have been impressed with their service. I have received quick responses to my inquiries. Lendio has been very good at providing me email notices of status and of items that they needed.  All documents that I needed to sign were submitted to me in easy-to-sign format. Lendio was also quick to advise and assist in forgiveness of loans. Simply put, I have nothing negative to say about my experience. I look forward to continue working with Lendio as the need develops.",5

Forgive me but I can't remember my loan processor name but he was the best. I would definitely recommend Lendio to others. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",5
Super customer services,"My experience with Lendio has been excellent. Working with Jason was a pleasure. Not only he was able to find a lender for my Company which is relatively new and with not much credit history but the interest rate, given my circumstances, where completely fair",5
They are great and fast to help you for…,"Right now I am not sure you really want a review from me.  Communicating with you is difficult to say the least.  Many times when I have a question I get some seemingly canned robotic response answering a question I did not ask.  You also need better response times.  Many times I wait days for a response and sometimes no answer comes at all.  Very annoying!!!  And to tell you the truth, the lending partner you recommended me to ""Ready Capital"" isn't any better with their communication with clients.  You might really be rated a 1 1/2 stars.  2 stars is stretching it.",5
Easy process,"Lendio Group were so helpful and knowledgeable through the Second PPP , they made the second PPP process so easy and smooth for our company, All their representative were professional and courteous and they made so easy for me, and I am glad we chose Lendio.Thanks,",5

No one seemed to have the authority or knowledge to navigate internally at Lendio.  I'm sure if you have a very standard straight forward application, it's fine, but questions aren't answered, and anything ""non standard"" is a huge problem.  I'd go to a regional/ local branch bank for anything non cookie cutter",5
Thank you for a smooth experience,"Hello the only reason I'm giving a 4 star, is highly do to the poor COMMUNICATION towards the end of the process, I reached out several times to my account representative by email and phone calls with no response.

Well informed and streamlined process,"Use at your own risk.  I started the process for a PPP loan, the application was pretty good except for a few contradictory requirements along the way.  The problem is I was assigned a SBA loan number 25 days ago and still no funding.  I've called 4 times and been told it would be looked into and I would get an answer back.  No answer.  I may miss out on the PPP program because of the incompetence here.  I'd recommend using a local lender.Update May 24, 2021 - I signed my documents over 2 months ago.  Still no funding.  No one will answer my calls.  Despite the response saying my issue was escalated nothing has happened.  I would advise staying well clear of Lendio.",5

Excellent Review,The website was reasonably constructed and easy to follow. My only difficulty was waiting for the approval of my PPP loan request. Apparently Lendio transferred my loan application to Legacy Bank. No one from Lendio notified me of the transfer. When i saw Legacy popping up on my email I thought they were soliciting my business because I had othger slicitations. Out of curiosity that I opened the email from Legacy and discovered that they were handling my loan. It would have been more professional if someone had called me to notify me of the transfer.,5
Lily Johnson gave great communication!,"Lendio was easy and fast. I would recommend them to anyone.Thank you Lendio,Loretta Heath",5
The process was quick and easy,"Lendios employee ( DS ) Did not seem that interested in pursuing our loan for the PPP loan. It took almost four weeks and  many phone calls and e mails from myself (owner ) And my accountant! In the end we did get the loan. I think they are a good company.

I had a second great transaction with…,I’m satisfied with getting my first draw ppp loan from Lendio. I updated my app on 3/11 to use gross income and was fully funded by 3/27. My only gripe is the lack of communication. There were times I would call or email and get no response. These are trying times and clients needs reassurance and more personalized care. Yet and still I’ll more than likely use Lendio for second draw since I’m already in their system and the process should go more smoothly. Thanks Lendio.,4
REALLY HELPFUL,"Lendio created a user-friendly process to complete a PPP application, provided clear instructions on next steps and timely feedback on progress update. From an initial application to loan funded was only about 10 days, simply outstanding!",5
Excellent service.,"We are a seasonal employer, & SBA guidelines allow a PPP loan to be calculated on this. We contacted 4 Lendio representatives, including 2 ""supervisors"" about this during the process. Only 1 got back to us. She stated the lender itself determines the amount of the PPP loan. This is totally false. Lendio  processed our PPP loan, & forwarded it to the lender after vetting our loan. We will be receiving about half of our first PPP loan.With only 1 in 4 reps responding, & falsely, & no ""supervisor"" response, we will be losing a good deal of our PPP loan. I do not recommend this company if you need a response or have special needs.",5
Great lender to work with,Very happy with my experience with Lendio! Nice and very helpful stuff made this process enjoyable for me!!!,5
Would definitely use them again.,Lendio is Awesome!  I applied online through Lendio for a PPP loan and they followed up with me to make sure I did everything correctly and in a very timely manner.  Lendio was fast and efficient and got me my loan.  Thank You Lendio,5

Nice fast and very professional,I funded with know problem but they could improve on response times had three different people to start with and they had no clue as to what was going on but the third one did his research and got it done after that smooth sailing funding went fast and I’m appreciative for that,5
Your website was very easy to use,I had a good  experience with Lendio. Easy process and they communicate. I would recommend lendio to friends and family,5
Loan,"Seamless Process If You Provide The Correct Documents. Must wait 8 weeks after first draw to receive second draw loan but it’s basically the same process, it is no guarantee that your loan will be processed by the same lender (bank) but it can so don’t be surprised. I didn’t like that idea at first but the more research I did I can conclude that really it’s no big deal if you just keep up with your PDF documents. As far as loan forgiveness, it’s processed through your lender (bank) NOT LENDIO and documents are very easy to fill out with correct documents (please keep track of all documents for your own good). If you are anything like me and you want to see some one else do it first/walk you through all of this literally step by step, then go to YouTube.com. Trust me it’s all there so don’t stress! Most recent videos provide the most up to date info especially since the government has been periodically adding to the sba loan process constantly. Hope this post can help you guys and I pray that god blesses you all tremendously!

Finally spoke to Brittany that said he was no longer with the company this whole time and she would get things taken care of. Had another person assigned to me...couldn’t get ahold of him either when my DocuSign’s weren’t anywhere in my email. They sent to wrong email! Couldn’t get ahold of anyone to correct. I spent an entire day digging to find out where the lender was. Finally found them (legacy’s bank in Oklahoma). The rep I spoke to there for me the DocuSign tans everything got resolved and I got funded in a matter of a couple of days. The reps from Lendio were absolutely awful!

Great communication and seamless process,So good. Fast accurate and friendly service.,5
Trust,Lendio helped me to get my PPP loan and would email me or personally call me to make sure the application was completed.,5
So glad I chose Lendio,"If I could give negative stars I would have.  The complete lack of communication and follow-up was absolutely appalling.  I signed up with Lendio after I saw one of their ads saying they would fund my business in as little as 24 hours after submitting a complete application.  Well it took 6-7 weeks to fund my business.  Being afraid that funds would run out, I applied immediately to the PPP program.  After multiple enquires to Lendio, I finally was told that a bank they partner with had my application for funding.  When I called that bank they said Lendio was holding up the process.  When I called Lendio back with that info they just said my application was in process and pointed the finger back at the bank.  Eventually they stopped responding to my pleading emails and phone calls.  No communication - period!  I even complained to the Utah Better Business Bureau(BBB).  Funny enough - they responded to my BBB complaint within a few hours and said a representative would reach out to me.  Again, this was false because no one EVER reached out to me. I FINALLY received funding 3/27 just a few days shy of the deadline.  My application was complete - because it was processed without any additional information.  Needless to say - this whole experience was extremely stressful and took a lot of my time away from my company.  Stay clear of this nightmare scenario and use an alternate company for your funding needs!",5

Using the Lendio online service,Confusion and delay have marked this process. I continue to wait for the outcome despite the lack of response to my inquiries and duplicated steps.,5
Good help,"When applying for PPP round 2, the process was very straightforward. When I landed on a section that was confusing to me, the form had informative tips to guide me through the process. I accidentally sent in the wrong tax form and my loan agent reached out to me immediately to get it fixed. After receiving my loan, I called my loan agent regarding a question on using my loan to pay salaries. She didn't pick up at first, but she called me within the hour to help answer my question. Thank you!!",5
Lendio was great,"Very professional.  Recommend to everyone. Cheers,",5

Getting my PPP loan through Lendio was easy.,I was very frustrated with the second round PPP. The first round asked for some things but 2nd round for much more stuff.1st round was only on line but 2nd round I started getting prompts by email.Each place I applied asked for stuff I never heard of then would come back with something else that might do. Lendio was the only one that came back from having dropped me to hand carry me through what they needed and when I told them by email I didn't have utility bills other than telephone and that it was made out to me not the corporation since I write the checks and that they already had the IRS return from 2019 with corp name and address on it as well as the business license ...all of a sudden I received Docu sign forms with an SBA loan. I was very much needed. Thank you for the help. K,5

It was a smooth process thanks Dawn!!,Upon making my call I was very frustrated with what appeared to be a process of getting the runaround. After speaking with a representative he explained the process and reason for delays due to SBA guidelines changes. He gave me a clearer understanding of everything and was very apologetic for any miscommunications from previous calls and advised me to trust the process and stay patient but to continue to monitor the portal for updates and follow up with my funding manager. I am being patient and pray all goes well in receiving my funding very soon for my business.,5
Thanks to Lendio my loan process so…,Calls for follow up on the PPP result three times leaving messages to a specific employee assigned handling our request but never received any calls back,5
Great and efficient plus quick services…,"While Lendio may have a good rating on this website, it goes without saying these reviews are likely not genuine, or they're whitewashed to remove bad reviews. Take a look at the Lendio Twitter threads and other reputable consumer sites, and you'll find dissatisfied clients just like myself. The communication and customer service are atrocious, and they've run afoul of the PPP loan guidelines with the lenders they're allegedly working with to secure loans, bypassing the SBA guidelines of funding loans 21 days after SBA Loan number assignment.It's been weeks since applying for a PPP 2nd draw loan, and the communication about where one is in the process is non-existent. Additionally, I'm in my second month without the funds for my small business. I'm starting to believe some of these secondary lender services are not very reputable, and it's a quick way for companies to attempt to cash in and take advantage of small business owners.If you have access to a community bank, specifically one you do business with, use the bank.  I think we're going to find that groups like Lendio stifled small businesses from securing the loans we needed during the pandemic because they waste valuable time and work with less than credible lenders. *Update since my original post*Lendio attempted to report this post as not genuine, and I was required to provide support documentation to show that I have a business relationship with the organization.",5
The process,Very helpful in a stressful time! Thanks for all your help.,5

Great service second to none,You all found me a lender and the lender hasn’t sent any funds to me. I don’t know what you all do with people information but that was personal information that I had to send in. I tried to reach Ready Capital and can’t reach anyone there about loan. I called you all and was advised that you all will get back with me the next day once you all had gotten in contact with Ready Capital. No one has called me back or anything. I could had went and tried to get a PPP loan from some where else but unfortunately I can’t because it is over with now. Horrible service. Will not recommend to anyone.,5

BUT they did come through with a loan which is better than my first lender or local bank could do!",5
the Lendio experience was exceptional…,I appreciate you helping my Bisness !!!! Thank you so much 🙏,5
Great job lendio,I really enjoy the application process. It was very easy and street forward. I like that there was no confusion. I also appreciated the follow up by the company in regards to documents needed. The only thing that I was not very happy about was the ability to contact somebody in the office. The hold time was too long and I went with long periods of time without hearing anything about the loan or the funding. But if I at the end had to do it again I would do it through Lendio.,5
The process was fast and easy,"everything is nice, it takes little time until docsign.",5
The application process was simple!,"You guys cap at 100,000 gross so you do not lend out no more than 20,800 and I need about 50,000",5

Thank you for that,"They made errors on my loan docs on several occasions and took 11 days to correct them. When they finally corrected them and I signed, my loan did not fund even though the documents were accurate. I then requested new docs which I had to sign three times before they were accepted. My loan then took another 13 days to fund.I emailed/called/texted my loan reps on numerous occasions and received a reply no more than 10% of the time.It was a horrible experience and I would never recommend this company.",5

The help and follow up from the Lendio…,Easy and fast to get the 2nd draw on the PPP.,5
Lendio was very easy to use!,"I appreciate that your company was able to obtain a PPP loan for us. However, there was almost ZERO communication between Lendio and us. The way we knew that the approval had happened was through the SBA. My CPA was working with another lender who approved us for more, and Lendio had already received ""confirmation"" from the SBA, just didn't tell me. So when that bank said ""you've been approved by someone else"", we had to go searching, and figured out Lendio had the approval....",5

I really appreciate what you did for me…,"Working with Lendio has been efficient, supportive and they got me my loan.",5
Lendio kept in touch with me through…,"I worked with Frank Battista and he really was a life saver.  We were having all kinds of trouble both with another lender and also early-on with Lendio due to our being part of a PEO for our P/R services.  Frank was one of the few people that understood what that meant in terms of the documents we had to submit and went ""above and beyond"" working nights and weekends to get our approval.  I truly believe we would not have secured the funds without his help.",5
Excellent Team,"Working with Lendio was quick and easy.  Whenever I had any questions I just called the helpline and got assistance right away.  Process was straightforward and easy, and I got the funds I needed in a short amount of time.  Thanks Lendio!",5

SO MR NO NAME I RECEIVED CALL FROM YOUR AGENT DAVE informing me that my application looks good and complete and will move to the next phase SO WHICH PHASE IS THAT? I do not know who is giving LENDIO 5 star review for fast service when they are very slow comparing to BLUE VINE.And now also unprofessional as they replied to me anonymously with giving me any contact information.I applied at LENDIO BACK ON March 24th 2021 and my request is still under review , even though I was called and received an email that my loan was approved and nothing has happened while my other business affiliates had applied with Blue vine and are already funded. Left two messages for DAVE who never returned my calls or email messages. DO NOT USE LENDIO NOR BLUE VINE. BLUE VINE reduces your loan amount by 1/2",5

Very good service.,I was very impressed how customer service responded to questions.,5
The staff of Lendio was very prompt and…,Fast and easy! The entire process took about 2 1/2 weeks from app to funding. The longest part was the app review. Once my app was sent to lenders I got the SBA number quickly and once I signed the promissory note through ReadyCap I received funding 3 days later. Thank you Lendio and ReadyCap for helping my business and making this a fast and easy process!,5
Awesome,Excellent process. Great communication thru the whole time. Compliments to all on your team for your professionalism Thanks,5

Lendio staff was very helpful…,Everyone worked fast to ensure the funding that I needed to help me with my business and I am very grateful! Thank you so much Lendio,5
They where very fast and accurate,"I do want to thank Lendio for their efficiency on helping me with my PPP loan. They did an excellent job! The time was minimum as soon as they approved my loan, they send me the documents to sign and the money was deposited in less than 7 days.Mr. Dave was very nice at guiding me. They did responded my questions all the time. Thank you Glamour for all your prompt help in responding my text and returning my voice messages. They charged me 0.0 for preparing me the loan all the way through.I do recommend you try them and trust them too.",5

Easy to work with,"I got my 1st round of PPP through another lending institution. However, when I tried to submit the application for the second round of PPP through the same lending institution, the process wasn’t easy and it was taking forever. That’s when I came across Lendio and decided to give it a try.  The application process was super easy and my application was accepted in about a week, then received my funding about 3 weeks after that. I’m super happy with Lendio and I will definitely use them again the future if I ever need financial assistance. I would recommend Lendio to anyone who needs PPP right now! :)",5
Excellent service,Every Funding Manager was responsive and helpful. I appreciate it!,5
Lendio is effecient and Great to work with,"Every other PPP lender was totally unresponsive and just sent us ""declined"" emails. Lendio actually worked with us, and helped us realize my partner's drivers license was expired which is why we were getting declined. They helped us navigate a complex situation and were fairly responsive given the massive volume of PPP clients they were working with. Ultimately, we got the money and are very happy.",5
They were not helpful from the very…,"Super easy to apply, had loan in a few days!!",2

Thanks so much was well over due,The process moved along quickly and I recommend Lendio to all my friends and family!,5
Lendio was a LIFE SAVER!!!!,"Lendio has very bad responsiveness.  They do not communicate and there is no one you can talk to on the phone, nor do they reply to emails about status.  Their systems also send you messages about your PPP status that say they haven't heard from you, yet I was checking in with them with all the emails I could find 2x per week.  It took 2.5 months to get funded, but with zero idea of when it would happen AND the deadline was just days away.  If your business really needs these funds, like we all do, it is WAY too stressful to use these guys.",5
Excellent!!!!,Super service. Fast efficient professional.  Funded rapidly.  No comparison with my bank.   Use these guys if you need a PPP loan. Don't delay.,5
I am very happy with Lendio services,"Customer Service was really bad.  Was unable to contact or it was really hard to contact a Loan Representative, either by email or by phone.  Calls were not returned.  Finally, we were forced to use an Officer at AmEx to contact a person at his level at Lendio to have the funds deposited, more than a month after signing the Promissory Note.  Website was not helpful either.",5
Thank you,Process was super quick and painless. My Lendio rep Cordell went out of his way to assist me in filing my documents.,5

Mr. Domanick McKinney Review,"When I would try and contact the company I was lucky if I would get a response. The time frame for processing everything was months, literally. Within that time frame there was constant spamming trying to get more business out of me or to link me to their social media. Quite the pain to deal with for something that should have been simple.",5
Excellent service,"Lendio was great it took a minute but you have to be patient in life for everything the funds were allocated to our business account within a month or so after filling out the application Everyone from my experience with Lendio got right back in touch with me through email or through phone it was awesome,thanks once again LendioAngel QuinonesAMQ ENTERPRISE",5
They wast fast very helpful and quick…,Very easy to work with. Thank You for all your help.,5
professonal and quick,Mike Greenaway ...good person eager to help and make things right.,5
Thank you,"If there were negative stars as ratings, even those would be too much for me to rate my experience thus far with Lendio. They are deceptive, provide horrible customer service and spend more time deleting negative comments on their Facebook than attending to the small businesses they have held up in their convoluted business practices. Lendio, along with their partner in crime, Ready Capital, need to be investigated by federal authorities for taking advantage of small business owners and federal dollars. I have reached out several times a day for transparency and get no where. I ask questions, they divert and disconnect chat, or tell me they will get back with me and never do. Run far away from Lendio and Ready Capital as they are not in the business of helping anyone but themselves. Do not buy into the positive comments for them on this forum as they cannot delete them. They likely pay someone to write for them. I have filed complaints and provided my attorney with all of the issues I have experienced. BTW, I have still not been funded and it is past the 10 days in accordance with the law. Lendio tried to send me an email stating I did not provide information when I applied, when I did. I am disclosing this because I believe this is their work around for obtaining an ETRAN number prior to Lendio reviewing applications. They lock you in with them and hold you hostage until they work backwards or you’re lucky enough to have someone fully  cancel the approved SBA loan number. Also, Lendio, don’t say you don’t have record of me, because we both know you do.***added to reply to Lendio’s Reply- no, Lendio, you did not help.",5
Thank you Lendio for your assistance,"I was helped by Dominick McKinney , this guy knows everything you will ever need to know about your PPP Loan , his knowledge and way of explaining the process is easy to follow and leaves you with the questions unanswered , it’s a shame he is not an account manager his talents are being wasted in his current position .",5
Lendio team did excellent work with my PPP Application,Excellent customer service and response.5 stars!,5
Great Follow ups,I recently received my second draw PPP through Lendio. I worked with Zac Smith and his team and I am quite impressed with their experience and knowledge of this process. I seemed to hit a few bumps in the road with the SBA while applying  and with each bump Zac was right there instructing me how to properly navigate the system. If it were not for Zac and his guidance I probably would not have received the loan even though I was entitled to it. Zac responded to my emails and calls expeditiously every time I reached out to him and he made me feel as though I was his only client. If and when I need assistance in the future I will certainly reach out to Lendio. I have the utmost confidence in this company and recommend them to any business who may need assistance. They were great!-Jim Nuciforo,5
The process of applying for the PPP was…,I have nothing but admiration for the team at LendioIt is banking services at its best,2
smooth process,Their support is too notch. The CEO helped me last year when it was first starting up for the PPP loans. This year his team was amazing. They reached out to help me fill out the PPP forgiveness. They also called to follow up with me about the loan. They were constantly checking in to make sure everything was ok. This is great leadership at its finest. Lendio is a great company that did so much for a lot of businesses that were struggling to stay afloat. I will be forever grateful for their help.,5
Lendio is very responsive and addressed…,"Got my money in two weeks.  I put in the info they requested, was funded immediately.",5
They did an excellent job assisting me…,I turned to Lendio after Chase bank who I bank with regularly and who secured my first PPP loan rejected my application for no good reason. Lendio approved my application in a timely manner and was very easy to use.,5
Gratitude,They were there when I needed them the most.,5
Faster works,Lendio was extremely helpful and constant communication and made what is a difficult process much easier than I expected.,5

I love my loan offer I know it's hard…,I thank lendio for helping me with all necessary documents what applying for the PPP.

I truly thank them for assisting me. Sincerely Lamonda Saunders,5
Amazing Company and very fast service,Thank you for motivating me to get this done!,5
Excellent service,it was seamless just more communication to know the states of the process,5
Leading Lending Fintech Technology and service,"This company is the most unprofessional company I have ever dealt with.  The CEO really did a podcast last week and lied abt every single detail of the second PPP process.  He damn sure wanted the money but didn’t want tot do the work.  They will approve you, deny you, tie up your e Tran number and then do it all over again just to keep you from being successful in your loan endeavors.  Do not use this company hopefully the SBA intervenes with how Ready capital has treated people.  Sorry bunch of clowns.  Update!!!!! The people with no brains  below told me thanks for my patience and my application has been canceled via their lender ready Capital and on the SBA website.  They don’t know their @&$ from a whole in the ground. My point exactly.",5
The processing information was straight…,Great Service.  Very helpful.,5
Thanks for everything,No communication. Multiple lending managers. It took about 3 months to get funding. Had to call or go on Twitter every week to get a little further each time. Very frustrating as a small business owner waiting for financial help.,5
Excellent guidance,"Quick, easy, and intuitive application process for PPP. Easy to track status of my application, and transition over to lender who approved and deposited funds quickly.",5
Good communication throughout the…,Lendio came on the right time it save my business and my family lendio you guys are the best on everything customers service fast everything thanks,5
Lendio helps make the process seems a little less complicated,"We were denied a PPP loan more than five times during the first round, with no one able to tell us why. We applied with Lendio for the second round and they made it happen! We were contacted for updated information throughout the process. All identity issues were solved by Lendio. We were approved! The entire process took about six weeks and was hassle free on our side. Lendio made it easy.",5
To many words to type my situation.,I submitted my application and it was completed and received on 2/25. I then was turned over to another agent on my account and he sent me the same information to docu-sign. When I informed him that I'd already completed the information on 2/25 he assured me all was ok and received. I continued to received notifications to sign the same docu-sign. I tried various times to reach Anthony and he never responded via phone or text.  This I didn't like at all.,1
PPP loan,"I applied for PPP2 through these guys - on the same day as my friend applied through BofA.  He was funded 4 weeks before me.  I called and emailed for updates and just to make sure they had my application.  NOTHING.  I kept receiving emails to sign something but there was nothing to sign.  They claim that they respond to every email but the reality is that their responses are automate requests for signatures OR to tell you that they'll be in touch.  So, the answer that they get back to you is misleading.  Another reason to avoid this company.  Also, yes, I was funded - MONTHS after other companies with same day applications - see note about BofA...sigh - still Lendio trying to obfuscate and mislead with their response.I will never use this service again -",5
Efficient and helpful,Lendio did a great job in securing my loan and insuring that I had access to the latest SBA changes and signature requirements to qualify.,5

I spent hours trying to handle a matter and he had it all wrapped up for me in a matter of minutes.  I did not once feel rushed or like a burden.  His concern that he help me was real.  I wish I could hire him myself.  Very rare to have professional treatment like I was given.,5
I took a year but that was not the…,Excellent service and it’s important to keep following up with the rep because they are so busy!,5
Everything went very smoothly,This is the only place that I found trulycare about Small business .

Smooth process,The worse service I have gotten in a really long time.Lendio does not return emails and or messages Poor customer service Lousy knowledge They take 2 months to process Sba ppp loans where everyone else 7-10 days To top it all off Lendio defrauded me out of my ppp loan which never received even though my account shows fundedI already filed complaints with SBA California department of Corporations California department of finance Mishandling government funds And investigation will start.Avoid this company at all costEven after a reply from then still nothing is done,5

I was able to submit all required documentation on line, and receive immediate feedback.  The process was short, and I was maintained informed of the status of my application.

Lendio was very professional and…,"..over all it was good, application starts out great, nice and simple, had some clichés, wish you ask me for review when I 1st completed the application. I remember that you need an icon to upload bank statements, I had to call to get help with that, took time. Another thing I remember for sure, the turn around time to be approved and receive notification and funding took a long time. I believe i applied in Jan, received funds in March..Thank youZarinah shakirS J & J Solutions LLC",5

Quick and easy,"The overall process in general took a while to complete, but, in the end very pleased.",5
The best lender,"I wanted to write a review for my recent interaction with Lendio and one of their employees. Her name is Kendall Chantille and I have to say that her service went well above and beyond what was required of her. Her pleasant attitude and caring nature was so refreshing. Especially during these current trying times we are all experiencing. I honestly cannot say enough good things about the way she handled my case and how she interacted with me via phone, email and text. If we all had Kendall’s attitude and outlook on life in general we would all be better off as a nation. Kendall, thank you for your excellent service. I appreciate all you have done for me. You deserve to be recognized for your kindness and dedication you provide to your customers. I haven’t received service like yours in a long long time. It’s been an absolute pleasure working with you. Thank you very much for all you have done for me during the application process from beginning to end. Please keep up your excellent work because it does make a difference. Sincerely,C. Widner",5

Lending went above and beyond to get my…,"Lendio was helpful at first when my process started in August 2020. I had a great representative who was there anytime and answered questions. He took all required information. Little did I know this process would drag on until March 2021. Multiple times submitting information because it was ""misplaced"" or ""filed incorrectly"" and my account changed hands more times than I care to even mention. I was contacted by text more often than by phone call and often those messages made little to no sense and when I tried to actually speak with someone at one point I was told that a State issued ID card was not acceptable when all Federal agencies even accept this. I was met by rude and unsupportive people at Lendio every time I turned around and finally they found a lender for me who had everything done in a matter of 48 hours. Not so sure I recommend Lendio until they get people who are willing to stay with the company and maintain the accounts better instead of passing them around like a hand of cards.",5
LENDIO IS THE ONLY WAY TO GO,"Lendio did everything so quick that I was impressed, Their agent was also very kind and very helpful.",5

It's so easy to apply, however they kept sending emails and texts to ask the same documents that I already submitted, and I had different representative to contact me.  At one point I felt like this was a scam.  On March 9, I withdrew the application, and applied with my bank.  However, the bank cannot submit to SBA because Lendio still hasn't withdrew it.  I tried to send so many emails and they gave the same answers that they withdrew it.  I tried to call to speak the representatives or even called the phone on their website, never get to a person to answer the phone.  I called SBA, and they said they couldn't do anything, the lender needed to withdraw the application.  Now I am stuck.",5

I experienced one small glitch along the way when I realized that Ii didn't put in for as much money as Ii was eligible for.

Good service,Lendio is a great company and great people to work with. They act quickly and follow up with me  to get the loans processed. I definitely recommend them for all your business needs.,5
Everything went smooth.,I applied for a ppp loan back on 3/8 the application process was seemless and pretty easy and straight forward. I was told of new sba guidelines that allowed businesses to qualify for a larger amount using the gross annual income and the ability to refinance an edil loan. I resubmitted the updated application with updated information as requested.  I was told that by application officer Dawn B that my application was sent to sba and the updated application was all they needed so I submitted it. Dawn B is amazing and actually cares to explain your application in detail. But then I was switched to Ronald P who is my financing officer and it’s impossible to get in touch with him regarding my application. Even though he was the one to initial tell me to update my application he never informed my lender that all information was up to date and for my application to be resubmitted to the sba. Now time is running out for the ppp loan application which is said to close 3/31 since it has not been officially extended. If I had known that the process would have been such a headache I would have tried other lenders I simply want my application to process and funds to dispersed into my account so I can keep my business afloat. At this point I’m not sure what to do because if you are that swamped and can’t process all applications then simply inform me and I will gladly look for another lender that can fund my business. The lack of communication and transparency is what frustrating. This is the first ppp loan I’ve applied for and it’s horrible I’ve had friends apply through blueacorn weeks after me and their application has already been sent to sba and assigned a loan number so I’m soo confused what the issue is with lendio and my lender is very disappointing.,5
Was a simple process,"Months!!! Still Nothing! This Company is a complete joke!! Stay away...you will be assigned so many different""Managers"" in which all will have you summit the same EXACT Documents over an over an over smh..BTW if you request for you application to be withdrawn they will ABSOLUTELY NOT RELEASE UR SBA # in which will NOT ALLOW You to apply to somewhere else! The government needs to step in NOW! What a let DOWN!",5
I absolutely loved my experience with…,"I applied although and got approved with SBA loan number. DID NOT RECEIVE THE FUNDS and have no clarity on when I'll be receiving them, I've sent follow up messages and they'd give me replies saying that there is a dedicated team working on my 'issue' and that someone in the team will be reaching out to me soon, although 3 days passed and nothing. Very disappointing. I'd suggest applying with bluevine. I applied with them the first PPP and nothing went wrong everything went smoothly with no fallouts.Reply to Lendio: Be mindful. My SBA loan got approved March 1st. It is March 29th, You have passed 10 days and yet NO FUNDS.",5

Exceptional customer service that's…,Excellent customer service! And very helpful!,5
my bank was not going to do any more…,"I recently applied for a PPP loan with Lendio. At first, the process took some time but it was due to new government guidelines that delayed all the paperwork. After that, everything ran smoothly until they assigned a lender to my application: Ready Capital. A couple of days later Ready Capital emailed me with a link to a DocuSign contract because my application was approved and they only needed my signature in order to fund my account within 72 hours. 72 hours later nothing happened. After contacting them via email I was told that the funds would reach my account within two weeks and then they sent another email saying 10 business days. I talked to a Lendio representative and he told me that these funds, in fact, take 10 to 15 days to be deposited into the borrower's account. And then I waited. Two days ago a received a new email from Ready Capital stating that my credit was denied due to “high-risk activity associated with the information/documentation provided with my PPP Application”.I was really surprised and upset after this email. I wrote them back saying that this was clearly a mistake but so far I haven't received any answer from them. I wrote Lendio another email explaining the case and no reply either. Then I started searching online about Ready Capital and to my surprise, the reviews here in TrustPilot were terrible (86% negative) and the word ""scam"" is everywhere. Not only that. The story is the same for everyone: they approve your application, they receive the SBA number, they make you sign a contract because your application is approved and days later they ""discover"" a reason to deny your credit (one of the reviews is exactly the same story as mine)Why would they make you sign a contract if the application is not approved? Shouldn't they review the application first and make you sign a contract later, after everything checks out? Isn't this a little suspicious? My guess is that they make you sign a contract so the SBA releases the funds to them and later they deny your application in order to keep the money. I don't know why Lendio keeps choosing Ready Capital as a lender. It's clear that their business practices are questionable and I would dare to say illegal. And this doesn't make you look good either. In fact, if I get the chance to have Ready Capital cancel my SBA number (good luck with that), I won't even think about reapplying with you.Thanks,Francisco Oduber",5

Lendio was very helpful,Very fast response Cynthia was nice hoping my file gets updated so I can get my second draw as this is helping me stay afloat.,5
great service!,"I applied with Lendio on 3/14/21. I received my ppp loan number /e-Tran # on 3/18/21. After that no more communication. I called no answer, I emailed no reply. I made a post on Facebook and someone sent me a private message saying that I was not approved (on Facebook!!) so I login my account to check the status of my application and it’s says under review still, I login in SBA website and I still have the same e-Tran #. I check back a week later everything still say the same. At this point I feel like this company is fraud and holding me hostage. If you guys decided not to approve me but showing an active e-Tran # and never contact me to officially to tell me I’m not approved you are holding me up from applying and getting approved elsewhere. Because it’s showing that I have an active loan just haven’t been disbursed yet, meaning that the funds has been set aside for me leaving me stuck and can’t apply elsewhere. I don’t understand Why is it taking so long to officially tell me I didn’t qualify. I just want to move on to another lender before funds run out and I can’t. I feel defeated and don’t know what to do. You guys supposed to help small business and I haven’t been help at all. I just want to move on.Lendio, how did you reach out to me? I haven’t received a email or phone call. What do you mean find my account on your system? SMH so now you can’t find my account?",5
Slow process if you really have a business to run,Quick turnaround from application to funding. Seamless!,3
It was a good experience,I applied over one month ago and still have no information. I can’t even get anyone to respond to me to tell me the status of my loan. I have received contracts multiple times to sign and I don’t know what is going on. Terrible customer service.,4

I do not know why lendio uses ready capital there is so many bad reviews if I saw this in the beginning I would of not wasted my time. I WOULD HAVE GONE WITH  WOMPLY OR SOMEONE ELSE .HORRIBLE  EXPERIENCE!!This is the only ppp provider with so many bad reviews and there is a common denominator  here and the volume of bad reviews speak for it self .",5
I received full funding!,"[Edit: The following review takes the place of a prior one discussing an issue that happened with one of my loans. One of the founders called me to get it taken care of, (so, good on them for that) but at the end of the day, there was nothing they could do based on when the contract was signed and when the SBA rules changed. I got my loan based on net income instead of gross.]Lendio seems like they're doing the best anyone can do when it comes to finding and coordinating with lenders. It's easy to imagine better communication with borrowers, but given the how much volume they're doing and how quickly they had to scale for handling PPP loans, it's understandable.1st and 2nd draw so far.

I am very happy with Lendio Team,Lendio helped us get our PPP loan when our bank failed to help us.,5
Great process and service!,"I liked the system for submitting documents but directions could have been simpler and more specific.  It was difficult to know when the information was complete and had met criteria.  I also had a problem knowing that the first round had been completed (with my application still on file).  I never felt personally attached to a responsible person on Lendio's end.  There was no way to communicate.  I spent months waiting and wondering with no feedback.  Then all of a sudden another request for information appeared that I thought had been received already.  The account changed hands a few times and I got confused about what was still needed.  After  was granted an amount not even 1/5 of what I started with as a projection, I was told I should accept it or face a another delay.No real choice there!  After the small amount was granted, the application included confusing language about how the loan would be repaid with a voided check needed.  I am now researching what forgiveness options are available. A lot was lacking in the process but the concept of pre-screening seemed good.",5

Absolutely amazing service!,Working with Lendio to get my first round PPP has been terrible.  I understand delays but after 2 full months I still don’t have any money and cannot get anyone to respond to me.  I will never use them again nor recommend them to anyone I know. Their reply said they reached out to me but all I got was a generic automated text and email with no substance whatsoever. No one is getting back to me with what the hold up really is.  What a joke.  There are many other lenders doing PPP loans out there. My suggestion is to Contact someone else.,5

Great Company and the support ample.,"They replied saying they reached out, they never did and never will. They post that to make others think they do. Suppose to be reached out by at least 4 supervisior already and here it is 2 weeks later.. nothingOne of the worst, applied for the PPP but i told them i wanted to wait before moving forward because there was going to be an option where you can choose line 7 instead of line 31 in your schedule C. We waited and as soon as it was passed, i called them and they had me send documents and had me choose line 7 and so forth. Then i ended up not getting the line 7 but was offer line 31 and lendio had no idea what happened and said i did everything right and they have no idea what happened, after that they just ignored my phone calls and emails, even when i called corporate, they dont care. They tell you they will let their supervisor know and will contact you soon but they never do. They screwed me over and they ignore you after that, not just the agents but the corporate themselves, they dont care if you’re business and employees are suffering, they make a mistake and they ignore you after that, they dont try to fix it or compensate. Everyone told me to go to this other person and i should of listen but i didnt and went with lendio. So everyone else please listen to me and avoid lendio before you get screwed over like i did. No matter who i talked to they always ask what my business is, which is a nail salon and end up ignoring me, i wonder why.",5
Very good company,"Although our loan were approved and we received the loan, they are very poor in communication. We could never get a hold of them over the phone, they also never answered their emails.",5

Lendio - a Perfect Example of an Online Platform with Zero Customer Service.,Straight forward program  easy system to utilize,1
Superb service,Working with Lendio for my business ppp loans was great. They help me throughout the process and emailed me the status of my loans constantly to keep me up to date. Everything went smoothly and I got my loans approved quick too. Highly recommended Lendio team to all businesses. Thanks Lendio,5
The great one on services,"Thank you for handling this , it was much needed and appreciated! The only thing I felt could of been different was instead of email contact ., a phone call would of been alot easier to talk to a live person",5
Michael was very helpful and was able…,"This process took 2 months. No one would ever correspond with us, answer questions, or give us an update.  I would never recommend this company to anyone.",5
I was very impressed with the services…,"The help from Lendio was better than I thought, just as I was giving up hope on how to obtain a PPP loan, they were persistent and didn't give up on helping me with the process. They answered my questions and asked for the proper documentation to ensure I got the loan. I am grateful for Lendio and will be returning for business with them in the future.",4

Excellent service,Thank you very much for everything. We really  appreciate  our regards from del tepeyac team,5
I did my PPP loan with Lendio No…,"It has been such a long drawn out process with Lendio. I started the application immediately and had to edit it multiple times with little help from their team. Their instructions were confusing and I could never get a customer service rep that would assist me through the whole process it was always 3 to 4 different people. I signed my paperwork for funds almost a month ago now and still have yet to receive my funds. I have reached out multiple times and their answer is ""they have no idea when I will receive"".. which is frustrating to say the least. I wish I did not go with this platform and am worried I will never receive my funds.Their response below is incorrect. I signed on 3/2. I am not sure what they are referring to with this 3/17 date but even 10 business days later I have still not received. This process has been extremely frustrating & I would be very cautious about working with them as it has taken months since I first began their application process.UPDATE: 4/5 - I still have yet to receive funds. I have reached out to three customer service reps and have received ZERO response.",5
Lendio did a fantastic job they really…,Awesome!I like that the application was fairly easy to follow and that I always knew the status/process of the application.  When I had question I called and got the help that I needed when adding the additional documents.Thanks Lendio,5

Good,I did not have a good experience with this company. You can never get on the phone with anyone they never answer any questions and it took forever to get my PP loan.

I actually thought they maybe lost my…,"I applied fall of 2020 but didn't get a loan, I think because the funding didn't come through in Congress. So when the bill passed for more PPP loans in 2021, I applied again in Feb 2021. My application was super fast and I was approved lightning speed. Before I knew it, there was a deposit in my account. It will really help with business expenses and gives me some peace of mind! The PPP is supposed to be repaid in 5 years with 1% interest, FYI.",1

I originally applied through popular banks, but Lendio was by far the smoothest and most helpful and ultimately the company that helped find my loan match.

Great company,They were good people too work with. They walked me thru the whole process. i would recommend them.,5

"Great Company, Great Communication",Amazing communication throughout the PPP loan process. Made the whole process smooth and effortless. Loan agents were wonderful.,5
I unfortunately did not get  to finish…,Joe Gadd with the Nashville office has been unbelievably helpful and responsive throughout this PPP process. I am so grateful to have worked with Lendio to get my PPP.,5

I had the best experience with lendio,Lendio was easy to navigate and incredibly quick clear and helpful in applying for a PPP loan.  I was at my wits end trying to find a lender and got one assigned within 2 or 3 days.  Complete success.,5
Sufficient,4 stars and that is only because they pay attention to you as an individual. Lendio has streamlined the application process making it the quickest way to get your funds. Because they understand how to avoid talking to you.  I was approved on March 3 and I still habent recieved my funds. They tell you the same line everytime. My bills are adding up as a direct result of your lack of doing as the sba ask and have our funds in tthe bank in 10 days. I could go on but I won't. All around I give them the benefit of the doubt and we will see what comes of this long drawn out unnecessary delayed process.,5
Thank you,"After wasting a month with Bank of America tyring to get my small business a PPP loan, Lendio got me connected with Ready Capital and funded within a week.  Thank you.",5

Excellent customer service !!!,"Well Done - I know that comparatively small PPP loans seem unimportant to large businesses, however, to small businesses/sole proprietors these funds are an infusion of lifeblood.

The process was extremely easy and the…,Very bad communication. Repetitive requests for duplicate information. Online platform does not allow to submit the requested documents. Customer service reps continually changed. Never answered phone or chat request. Each New representative was not very helpful. Still receiving requests for additional information after the PPP Loan was approved by SBA and funded by another bank.,5
Lendio helped secure my loan through…,Lendio has helped me secure two PPP loans. Their portal was extremely easy to follow and kept me up to date on my current status. I absolutely suggest using them to help make the PPP process simple and easy!!,5
Awesome experience overall with Lendio,"I only gave it one star because ""0"" wasn't an option.  Lendio approved me for a PPP loan and sent the documents for that amount, which we both executed.  They then only partially funded, about 58%, of the agreed upon amount.  I was finally able to make contact after over a dozen calls, and they acknowledged they made a mistake but had not idea if or when they would rectify and have dodged all calls and e-mails since.   This is an organization with no credibility or integrity.  They just don't care about their clients, simple as that!",1
Would recommend Lendio.,Made the process quick and easy. Very responsive to all questions .,5
Had a great experience with Lendio…,"My journey started January 20th. The day PPP Round 2 opened. I was very well prepared and had my documents ready as well. I was approved for my SBA Loan on March 6th with Lendio by Ready Capital. I didn't find out until a week later until I logged into my Caweb account and seen that the loan was approved for my business.I immediately contacted Lendio. They didn't know I was approved either. My dashboard was saying Application Withdrawn. I sent a message to the chat and I was informed that my Application was not withdrawn and that the SBA did approve my loan.I was immediately assigned another Funding Manager (I think I've had 15) Molly was really nice and she apologized for me getting ""lost in the system.""Molly forwarded my over to Kyle. I was really happy to start seeing things moving since I'm currently at 2 months and 5 days since I submitted my application.I passed the First Verification phase. I was then told that I would be receiving my Closing Documents from Ready Capital.This was March 15th. Then I was asked to provide another round of verification documents AGAIN. It seemed like random documents since they aren't required by SBA but I had the documents already submitted back in January.I'm well beyond the 10 day funding rule by the SBA. And I'm one day away from the 20 day rule by the SBA as well. It's day 19 and I'm doing EVERYTHING in my power to get my closing documents.It's a scary feeling knowing that you're ONE day away from the SBA funding deadline once you're already approved - and you haven't received your Closing Documents.I've been proactive and making sure that I also speak to Ready Capital as well. I applied the first day PPP Round 2 opened to get a head start and now there are 6 days left until PPP closes.I want to give this company 5 stars but it's been an extremely long, strange, weird and drawn out process. We have Employees that we are looking out for and the anxiety experienced was just unbearable.Receiving the Closing Documents today will be great. Please advise.(Update) A month later, Lendio sent an automated email with our SBA Loan Number stating we were denied funding. We were funded our PPP Loan already from another company. Lendio dropped the ball and pushed it on to their ""customers"" - they did this to thousands of small business owners. Shame. We won't forget.",5
I honestly believe that I would not…,I feel greuful and satisfaid. They so quick and efficient.          Thanks you for help peoples like us..                                                 R.N.M.,5
So easy and seamless,"Fast process, interactive.",5
Perfect !!!!!,Lendio provided a fast application process. The Staff stayed in communication with me when needed. I had a great experience through the whole process.,5
Helped me with my PPP Loan,Took exactly 14 days for deposit thanks again,5
Great service and follow up,Filling out the application was easy however the process after that was pretty long and mysterious.  I tried several times to get ahold of someone at lendio and wasn't able to ever get a real person on the phone.  If I missed a call from them I wasn't ever able to connect with them in regards to why the loan hadn't been funded.  I was approved with a loan number and then didn't get funded until 6 weeks later.  I would not recommend this process to someone who needs money fast and wants live communication. If you're laid back and don't really care about the timeline this would work for you.,5
Amazing quality service,The company is very bad at getting back to people when you ask to get an update. I emailed and called countless times and only got through twice. The process is very slow with not much update given. Besides that they are working hard to help as many people as they can in this pandemic.,5
Lendio was easy,"Every step I have questions about the Loan, there always has someone helped me!",5
The process was easy !,The Process was super  fast & my money was deposited within 10 days,5

PPP 123,Great job! Everything Went smoothly! Thanks.,5
"Great, simple, precise.",I think Lendio was great overall to work with but there was some confusion on what documents to upload. I would still recommend them though.,5
Excellent staff,"Doesn't take a genius to realize that most of the recent reviews that are positive seem kinda fake and the negative ones give a lot of detail and seem more truthful. If your like me and went through lendio because your Google search for best ppp loan companies said they were number 1 raise your hand. Now did you file like me and sign edocs then came to read reviews lol. Well, we all live and learn. Yup, filed back in February recently just got word to finish some unfinished parts and got APPROVED by ready capital. Now just getting the run around. This is horrible and smells really fishy. Nothing we can do at this point though 😟. Good luck. Stay away from this company if you can.",5
Excellent service,thanks it was a big help,5
Outstanding and efficient,"We are a parent company based in Colorado and we have a wholly-owned subsidiary company in Hawaii.  We applied for PPP loans for each.  The loan for the parent company was approved and funded.  The loan for the smaller, subsidiary company was denied.  The reason was Lendio got confused because the company names are similar.  Lendio messed up the loan applications consistently and did not respond to our attempts to straighten out the mess it created.___________________________________Lendio's response to this was an offer to help make it right.  I was told to go to my ""borrower portal.""  The website  for Lendio does not allow me to go there.  What am i supposed to do?",5
The best experience!,"Lendio helped me out with both phases of the PPP Loan Program. Both times they matched me with a loan provider in record time, and both times my application was successful, thanks to Lendio's facilitation. I HIGHLY recommend using them for any loan query you may have.",5

Desiree was outstanding,Exellent customer service and solving my needs!!,5
Thanks Lendio,"LENDIO RESPONDED TO THIS REVIEW AND CLAIMED TO HAVE REACHED OUT TO ME. ITS A LIE. THEY DID NOT. NO ONE REACHED OUT. NOT A MISSED CALL, AN EMAIL, NOTHING! This is my 2nd review. Lendio and Ready Capital are both lost with funding. I have been waiting on a deposit since March 3, 2021. I have been waiting on an answer about funding since March 8th. No one at Lendio has an answer, no one at Ready Capital has an answer. I have not been funded. My bank has not received, rejected or recovered any wirings or deposits into my account. My business has been depending on Lendio since early February. The beginning process with Lendio intake was unorganized and messy. This isn’t fair to business owners. Lendio and Ready Capital is neglectful and just as confused as the public.",5
Recommended!,Lack of communication and when Lendo reps do respond it's clearly canned responses they are just copying pasting. Very clear this is a a huge call center with high school students or immigrants working there. No knowledge of what they are actually processing. After my submission there were 5 emails I sent to just 1 email received from the rep who said I need to submit a SSC. He never responded to me on what that was. Then the rep abruptly changed to someone else. Clearly high turnover with un knowledgeable staff.,5
Their team takes the time to assist me…,Michael made the entire process extremely smooth and simple while staying on top of things to make sure the deal closed. Hands down best lender I have worked with in this space and I will be recommending him to other clients who could benefit from his services to grow their business,5
Very easy to use and knowledgeable…,very helpful made sure i understood everything kept up with the loan,5
Lendio was very helpful and attentive…,Approved me for a high line of credit within days.  Process is minimal compared to others. Rates are comparable.,5
Positive Experience with Lendio,The help was good I was given 2 numbers and received the lowest number. For the ppp its all good. The associates who help were great and helped as much as they could. Thank you,5

Lendio was so great to work with,Lendio was efficient and responsive throughout the process. Couldn’t ask for better service. Thank you,5
GOOD JOB...,"Lendio paired me with a lender who got my loan initially funded. However, a technical glitch with the funding is currently preventing another loan. Lendio passes me to the lender, the lender passes me to the SBA, the SBA passes me to Lendio and the cycle continues. After multiple requests for a call from a supervisor, nothing has happened. Lendio just provided a response that all funds needed to be utilized prior to requesting a second draw. Again, missing the entire point. The funds have already been used, but I still cannot apply for Draw 2. My review will still remain poor.",5
It took them a little while to get to…,I applied for the first round of PPP with Lendio. The process was very simple. I love that they kept me updated along the way and funding was sent within 2 weeks.,5

It's was Great working with Lendio on…,I received my loan so that was a great success. The down side was I received an excessive amount of emails from multiple people that conflicted with each other.

Very excellent treatment,"Thank God for Lendio. I applied for and received a second-draw PPP loan in no-time flat. I did the first round through my Giant Mega-Bank, and the entire process was horrible. My loan was under-funded and there was nobody to help. Working with Lendio was the polar opposite: My loan was fully funded, the process was seamless, and it barely took any effort. It actually seemed too good to be true. But there is a nice pile of loan money in my bank account today, so it's real enough. Could not be more pleased. Legit, well-organized, great support, and we get to give business to smaller lenders we would never have found otherwise. Great experience.",5

Great Experience,I got a email I entered all my info it said within 72 hours it would be funded it has been over a week and my loan still has not posted on my account.,5
This people are truly amazing,We were very pleased to be able to work with Lendio again. It was very simple to follow and be able to provide the required information to make our loan possible.,5
Thanks,The uploading of documents was easy. The talking with a lender was almost non-existent when I had questions. Response time to emails was slow and there was never a call back from the lender to any voice mails left. I am still looking for the instructions on who I am suppose to send the forgiveness form  for the PPP loan.,5
Great company,This was for a round 2 PPP loan.  Website application was confusing and hard to navigate.  Uploads were confusing.  I was asked to provide documents that had already been uploaded.  Approval and processing time was slow.  Funding was slow.My round 1 PPP loan with a different lender was far easier.  I had approval within 2 days of application submission and funding within 24 hours of docusigning.,5
Thank you for your support and guidance…,They are fast working They communicate well with you and there was professionalism all the way around from beginning to end,5
Excellent and Awesome !,Really great company to work with. Their website was especially easy to navigate and the lending process was quick.,5

Fast and easy,"Portal was really easy to use, with clear explanations of what information was needed and how to complete the form(s) and upload documents. The interface was very clear with step-by-step screens that walked you through the process. Expectations were clearly set about what happened at each stage of the process, with status of the application clearly indicated, and contact information was easy to find. Email updates made it easy to follow status changes. Thank you lendio for designing such an easy process and portal. Kudos to the designers and product to making the experience easy to understand, follow, and complete.",5

Lendio,"I’m so appreciative of Lendio! They were prompt and diligent in reviewing my application, letting me know what documents I needed to get to them to get an approval, and they were prompt in sending my funds. I had no issues, and a lot of support from the loan advisor I was assigned to. I will definitely refer them to everyone I know who needs a PPP or any other loan.",5
Excellent job,I have contacted the funding manager twice and she still has not gotten back to me.,5
I submitted my application on…,"Never replied to a single email. Sent form emails made out to the wrong name. Very difficult to get a hold of a real person, and hard to have confidence the person was giving me real info when I finally did get someone. They were just overwhelmed--sending out auto-generated emails with wrong info, then it was difficult to get to the bottom of what was really going on. There are some good people who work here, but I will not work with them again.",4

I worked with Justin at Lendio for a…,Lendio did an amazing job finding me a PPP lender. The process was simple and the representatives kept me updated along the way. I’ve recommended Lendio to several of my friends.,5
Fast and efficient.,Lendio was quick and easy with the application process and getting it through to a lender. My problems came after being matched with Legacy Bank as my lender. They took a little longer funding than advertised but over all easy and straightforward experience.,5
I have never had such a smooth…,"Lendio's communications platform is extraordinary.   From the initial email messages, through the entire application procedure and to loan closings and fund distribution, they're timely, accurate, informative and very professional.  Make a positive and meaningful change in your life and contact Lendio today.",5
Very easy to use,"Lendio provided excellent customer service. They were there every step. Help with all documentation, getting all documents verified and constant fallow up through the process. I was informed through every step and transaction. At times the process was confusing because of the changes in the institutions that was no longer used by my company. They were patient and walked me through the whole process. I couldn't ask for more. ""EXCELLENT WORK"" Thank you very much.Fuller Lawn and Landscape Services: Nathaniel Fuller Jr.",4

Great service quick,Quick and easy application process. Great communications,5
It was very easy for me to get funded,"It appeared that Lendio was not quite set up for PPP2.We were given at least 5 different account reps with each one not knowing what the other was doing. All phone calls and voicemails were never returned.  very frustrating.When things finally settled, lending was done a timely basis",2
They were very fast on my turnaround…,The communication is horrible my status has been in Funded status for over a week still no funds or explanations. They won't give me straight forward answers. I don't recommend Lendio at all.,5

Amazing..,Great service from start to finish.  When no one else can get the job done -Lendio is the one to go to!,5
My experience with Lendio has been…,Great working with Lendio - best part of experience was personalized attention - you actually get phone calls from real people who give you updates on the status of your loan.  It was a long process getting an SBA 7(a) loan but Lendio made what would have been an extremely challenging process doable!  Highly recommended!,5
Right now I am not sure you really want…,LENDIO IS FANTASTIC!!! Quick and easy. Will definitely return to get my SBA loan.,2
Lendio Group,Helpful customer service. Got the PPP loan package done and funded. No problem.,5
Great customer service,"What a terrible company to work with. I had a loan in process with them, they updated me that they were going to need some additional documentation but my loan was approved, and then that's the last I've heard of them. It's been 3 weeks, no response to emails, their phone numbers never ring to a real person, and laura williams and chris colucci who are involved on my account have proven to be a massive disappointment in their failure to even respond to me. What a frustrating and nerve-racking experience to need a loan, know that it got approved, and yet your loan representative(s) won't even reply to you. I can't think of a worse experience to have with a lender. How does a company like this even stay in business.....I'm willing to update this review if I finally hear from my lender representative, but I doubt I will hear from anyone based on their lack of response and customer service so far.",5
I highly recommend Lendio,"Lendio is all about customer support. Their thorough focus on communication via text and phone was phenomenal. Every step of the way, they helped me gather the correct documentation to fast track the loan approval process. I was truly blown away by their effort to support me and my business. 10 stars.",5
It was so beautiful and fast Process,"I really didn't want to post this review and actually gave them the opportunity to reach out to me, which they still haven't done. This was just an awful experience once the application had been completed, they kept telling me it was ok but then they said more information was needed, I was given different contacts who never called or emailed back. I was getting concerned that perhaps fraud was occurring since I could not find out what was happening with my application and there was nobody to talk to. The process took a really long time, much longer than the timelines in the FAQ's.In response to their response, I did reply to them and again no one got back to me. The 10 days was more like 2 months, and I didn't feel the need to respond to the congratulations email. I did also respond to the request for this review, and said that they really didn't want me to write a review, and again, no response. So they sent me a reminder to write my review and here we are.",5
Our application was processed quickly…,Great and user-friendly platform with a dedicated person which makes it manageable if yo have any questions.,5
Great website with smooth file uploads…,A great company and team to work with during navigation of the PPP application process. They simplified the process for our business and carried us along as per documentations needed for the approval process.,5
Fast,"They were very easy to work with,  the communication was great, i felt like i was updated every other day if not daily",5
Thank you very much.,"Communication was non-existent.  The process took over 8 weeks when I had colleagues getting applications submitted and funded within 5-10 days.  Taking that long, and never having phone calls or emails returned was unnerving. I was constantly worrying if I should be submitting my application somewhere else.  Once it was in the final process of approval I received and email telling me to ""hurry up"" and sign the documents before my SBA Loan expired.",5
Thank you Lendio for processing and…,It's user friendly and online chat is always available to answer my questions.,5
Lendio was simple,"Omg Alyssa was so amazing to work with . The entire process was so easy working with her I didn’t think it would be so easy but I truly appreciate her , every time I called I got an answer she was super sweet . More than satisfied with her customer service skills !!",5

Simple process,Great company,5
This was a fast and easy,Excellent and very efficient service.very professional  staff. Excellent follow up,5
It was a pleasant experience,"I’ve tried getting a hold of customer service with hardly any luck. When I do get help nothing is accomplished. My loan has been showing as funded but I’ve received nothing and no one seems to care. *update*** it is now the 23rd of March and I still have not received any funding.** UPDATE**It is officially March 26th, the 10th business day since I was “approved for funding” and I still have not received anything. I was told 72 hours once I signed my loan papers, which was very apparently false. No one can answer me as to why I haven’t received the funds yet instead they pass the buck onto the next person. This is the worst experience ever.",5
Lendio made the process easy,I appreciate the help from lendio and all the help they provide it took a little longer in a little stressful at times but at the end of the day they came through in the process was great thank you it's such a time as we're living in.,5

Thank you very much for your help…,"Lendio eventually helped us get the PPP loan we were applying for, so we appreciated the platform to be able to get in front of banks.

They were very helpful throughout the…,"Two months of mistakes, accidental mistake loan denial emails, they submitted to lender twice incorrectly, incorrect calculations and change in loan manager four times.

I’ll never use them again.",5

Excellent service love it,Lendio was excellent in me obtaining both PPP draws.  I have recommended Lendio to several of my clients and I believe that they were also very satisfied with the way Lendio has performed for them.,5
Very professional and efficient!!!,"The first time was hands down a 5. This time the process took longer and my account manager changed 3 times during the PPP process. I suppose its getting more difficult, but the communication was not as good or as well followed through. Just saying.",5
Lendio was prompt and responsive to our…,"I spoke to several different people on numerous occasions and got help with my PPP loan. Then I heard nothing back. Then I got a phone call saying that they were waiting for me to sign my contract, when I had not received an email with that contract.

I asked her for her information she said don't worry I will email you everything as soon as we hang up the phone and that's when all communication stopped with lendio. That was about two weeks ago.",5

“Lendio has got your Back” look no further!,Time lapse to long between receiving information on loan process. Lendio switches to many account managers during the process it hard to know who is actually handling you account. Had to contact the actual bank to push the process through. Would not suggest using if you are in need of getting your fund in a reasonable time line.,5
Tot i wasn't gonna be approved but…,"The fact that the money finally came out was a good thing , however , many different agents of Lendio that were contacting me with different telephone numbers and email addresses  and asking for the same documents that has already been uploaded twice or three times earlier was worrisome and almost made me to loose interest in the application until i got a call from another Lendio agent who put my fears to rest . That was not a good experience . My rating was as a result of the final positive outcome .",4
Great service and customer care!,"The process was simple, easy to follow instructions, and questions were answered in a timely manner. Thank you for your help!",5
Excellent service!,Lendio was easy to work with and responded quickly.,5
clean and easy way to get the ppp loan.,"Good Job lendio, thanks for expediting my loan.I think there should be a swift line of communication between your customers and loan managers.I havent received my funds but sent numerous messages to your representative taking care of me  but didn't get a response not until i spoke with ready capital.

I was worried at first that so many…,"I'm not sure which experience we are supposed to be reviewing here, so I will go over both of the recent ones.We applied for and received a PPP loan through Lendio (yay!). The application process was a little rocky because we were asked for scanned copies of social security cards, and mine had been lost. We were unable to get the card from the Social Security Administration because of COVID-19, and so lost some time trying to get it. However, another representative told us it had been on file the whole time from a previous funding. Then, emails started going to my wife's personal email for some unknown reason, which caused further confusion and delays. So, a general difficulty in the communication/customer file management, but it worked out.Next, I attempted to apply for a loan to help me build a shop for our business. I went through a process to be denied at the end because we ""didn't meet the $8,000.00 minimum income per month."" We have been struggling to get through the COVID lockdowns, business losses caused by new clients pulling out of sales agreements for the same reasons (unable to open the doors on new businesses during the lockdowns), and our normal seasonal ebb and flow of sales (no small part being due to not having that building during the rainy winter months). It has been rough, but we're still here and still need to make forward motion. Instead of wasting my time, it would have nice to be told that if our business' income dropped below a certain threshold, we wouldn't even be considered. I would like to point out that it hardly seems fair to look at the statements in the slowest part of the year, during the pandemic lockdowns, and using that as a basis for denial of a loan that would increase productivity and sales for the term of the loan.",5
Very good company to have on your side…,Courtesy was superb... Fast and guided me through the whole process...Was able to speak to an account manager each time I called...,5
Everything from start to finish was…,I would like to comment on the enormous help I received from Lendio with receiving my PPP loan and I’m truly impressed with the professionalism their lending agents showed me during this process. I would recommend Lendio to anyone who is looking for a PPP loan or any other. Thank you so much for showing me that you truly care and have your client’s back.,5
Very easy website to operate and smooth…,"Lendio helped me to get my PPP loan when others were harder to work with. I didn't even know I qualified for a second PPP and Lendio quickly showed me I was eligible based on the circumstances. The money took time to come in, but that is due to the SBA being overwhelmed and not Lendio. Thank you for the ease of use through the process.",5
Smooth ride,Lendio was fast and friendly. They kept me informed every step of the way.  I would recommend them to anyone looking for a loan.,5
Very helpful with everything!,Second draw was supposed to be “easier” - far from it.,5
Excellent Job...,Great follow thru but it took a lot longer than it should have. The up side is they were in touch with me at every step. Thanks Ledio,5
Fast and easy,Lendio is one of the best in the lending business. They are compassionate about helping people improve your business financial health. Frank Battista is very patient and thorough in making sure you get what you deserve. You can trust Lendio and you won’t regret it. They know their craft.

Thank you Lendio,Good communication and help,4
Lendio system process is simple,I recently received my second draw of the paycheck protection program. This time around the process took more time for my request to be processed. There seemed to be much more due diligence in order to verify all of my Information but I was very happy with the process even though it was lengthy. My business is great full for Lendio’s PPP servicing.,5
From the first contact,They asked the wrong person for a review.  This company has been terrible .  They have sent me papers to sign many times which I did.  Then they tell me I should have my loan in my account within 72 hours.  I have been waiting over 4 weeks.   Then they turn me over to another company which I still an waiting to be funded.  Don't waste your time dealing with them they suck.,5
They made the PPP loan process very…,excellent service very good communication thank you lendio for your collaboration,5
Our Funding manager changes 7 times…,The software was easy to use but I would have appreciated weekly updates as to status.  You were able to get the deal done & I know it was not your fault that it took almost 60 days due to all the sba changes.Great job getting it done,2

Great customer service and follow-up…,Good Very respectable company,5
They were very helpful and explain the…,"We applied for both rounds of PPP loans through Lendio. Lendio helped us matching the lender quickly and provided seamless services and support to our application. The funding is quick, and the Lendio team cares about the small business so much. Thanks, Lendio!",5
Great Service,"Things started out well with Lendio, they kept the pressure on to get all paperwork ready to submit so that when applications opened they could submit. We got thru that process and they were great. Then it came time to submit, we ended up with a new person of contact it seemed like every other day. They started requesting paperwork they already had. It seemed like daily we were getting requests for the same paperwork requested by the previous point of contact. We would get an email stating everything is good to go and the next day that they wanted more paperwork(which they already had) trying to get someone on the phone was near impossible and the only way I did get in contact with them was finding a link on their Facebook page to ask questions. I’d have to say the experience was terrible especially during such stressful times and never knowing what was going to happen next. We would receive a confirmation letter stating we are approved and good to go, then receive an email requesting more info once again, then an email stating our application is rejected and then another email stating it’s going to fund. I never leave reviews on anything but this one I had to. I don’t think they were prepared for the volume of applications they took on. I think they got buried and short staffed. I hate to leave bad reviews any where but the issues we dealt with were insane to the point we reapplied with another company only to get an email that we were approved and funding. So with drew that app only to get an email stating it was rejected. In the end it got done but their customer service sucks",5
Very responsive and informative,Easy process.   A few glitches in the end but overall good process.,5
Very happy with ease of use of online…,"Lendio was very instrumental in getting approval for my PPP loan. They communicated very effectively and clearly explained the requirements. Also, when the lender needed more information or had questions, they were quick to notify and assisted me in getting my loan approved.I would certainly consider Lendio again.",5
Very happy with the response time,It was so helpul for me I realy appreciate itIf I need an another financial help I will ask you first. Thank you so much,5
I love the way the process went,"Great process. Very fast. Application was very clear. I applied. Submitted my application, it was reviewed and then I was funded by legacy bank within week. Very happy with the process and the outcome.",5
Very Professional,they work hard to give us this helpthey are on point when it comes to the ppp,5
Lendio was there to answer questions…,Everything was so fast and there customer service is awesome!,5
Lendio did get our PPP loan approved…,"The site was ok, but it was difficult to get support if needed",4
IT WAS BETETR THAN BOA SERVICE QUICK,Great job!  Great job!,5
I did get my ppp loan,"3 stars is generous, only because I finally received my PPP about 6 weeks from submission of application.  However, the communication with Lendio was very poor.  I kept receiving e-mails from different people that I had not sent certain documents, which I had...and when I replied to these e-mail, I never received a response.  At one point, I couldn't login to my account at all...I changed passwords etc.  So I e-mailed support 2 or 3 times and finally received a useless response.  Meanwhile, I did receive the PPP documents to sign, which I did.  Then it took almost a week to receive the funds, so I stopped trying to communicate with Lendio.  The first PPP through AMEX went much more smoothly",4
Quick & easy!,Quick and efficient handling of my PPP loan.  My big bank would not help me but Lendio found a way to set me up with a bank that would.  Thank you Lendio team!!!!,5
great bank,Lendio is the best platform to get a loan for a small business. I've tried numerous times to apply for a PPP loan with large banks and all of them denied my application. With Lendio I was able to get approved from the first try and the process was clear and easy!,5
Fast service,Lendio was very helpful and diligent to follow through the entire process.,5

excellent service,Seamless and great web site to apply for PPP.,5
I got funded fast and easy,"Made progress quick and easy. Excellent work, thanks",5
Not a great option for anything you need guidance on,The application process was fast and easy. The communication between lendio and Benworth could’ve been better. Benworth contacted me asking for more documents I called Lendio and asked them if I needed to submit more documents  and they said no. Finally contacted Benworth and gave them everything and week later I got funds.,2
Hello the only reason I'm giving a 4…,"The average value of the two rounds of PPP loans was completed through Lendio's application, the progress is fast and the customer service is perfect, and it is recommended to the owners of enterprises.

Use at your own risk,I signed closing docs a while back and my lender still haven’t contacted me back to let me know when my money is hitting my account I’m receiving no feedback at all this is stressing me out .,1
WE signed a agreement on Feb 23rd and…,"Working with Lendio was amazing!  I received direct communications via email, phone and text offering help with my application.  The guidance received was direct and effective.  As soon as I got the application in, I began receiving updates and an approval within 3-4 days.

In the nick of time....,Best lending company I’ve ever worked with. Easy to get ahold of and worked diligently to get my funds available as soon as they could,5
It took a long time to get my PPP loan.,Great company thank you for helping me out with PPP forgiveness loan.,4
Great service.,Great job communicating and helping facilitate funding!,5
Good processing,Service was great.  The folks were sensitive and persistent to accomplish the end goal of funding.I found the folks personable and kind.,5
Process was easy and quick turn around.,"They totally messed up my ppp 1st somehow I went from getting 23900 but through some sort of mistake from their end from getting 23900 to 5000 pretty disappointed is to say the least and I was told it was going to be escalated to a manager and basically nothing has happened since. I am ready to take my business elsewhere I got a message they do not even realize nothing has posted or been issued yet to do date. Seems your unable to give a strait answer on what needs to be done. I should have gone through my own bank in first place. If lendio wants review adjusted get back to me and tell me whats,what instead of a complete lack of communication. I call in and I can never get ahold of a single person, my agent is switched three times and I can never seem to reach anyone.",5
super easy to secure funding for PPP loan!,Great and fast service!Eva is very helpful and follow up with me to make sure every documents needed and completed.  Thank you very much for your help.,5
The Lendio staff was very helpful and…,"Easy to fill out forms online, questions were answered. Applying for PPP-2 was confusing, but made easier with the instructions provided.",5
Extremely quick process.,"I took nine months and six Lendio agents but I was eventually funded so that’s worth one star. Each agent would tell me I was approved and funding was on the way, then would disappear and a new agent would contact me to say my application was not complete. The communication was so poor that I’m sure it was planned that way. Don’t know why they play that game but as you can see from their reviews it doesn’t lead to customer satisfaction.",5
Awesome,"Everything was quick, and straightforward, the only reason why I am not giving Lendio 5 stars is because I got some emails from some bank people who apparently worked for Lendio, but they did not state that in their email, and the domain name of the email was not ""xxxx @ lendio.com"". Also the way that the emails were typed and addressed seemed ""spam-like"". So I almost disregarded the emails. I had to reach out to the contact person in my Lendio account to confirm that they were legit emails. In this day and age, it's so important for a business to communicate well in proper grammar. In addition, it would have been nice to receive some kind of notification or auto-email that said to expect an email from [x contact person].",5
Customer service is not customer driven,Anthony was great on hearing the needs of my business and then adjusting the loans I was seeking for accordingly!,2
It took a little longer than expected,Results were quick and efficient. Lendio was very helpful to answer any questions. The overall experience was excellent.,5
Quick PPP :Processing,"I tried using Lendio for the first PPP draw and was disappointed by the lack of follow through. I contacted American Express and was treated as only AMEX could, personalized, led step by step, and received funding 4 days after my application was completed. Unfortunately, AMEX was no longer handling the 2nd draw of PPP and referred me back to Lendio. I filed my application with Lendio again and waited, and waited, and waited. This time, I called and finally reached someone and amazing, after escalating, I received my loan documents. But again funding didn't take place. However, the name of the lending institution was on the loan documents. I called the lender directly and amazingly, I received my funding 2 days later. I am happy that I was able to receive my 2nd draw of PPP but Lendio didn't have a good means of assigning ""one person' to follow through with the application process, the process of following the completed application, and following up with the lender. It should not have taken so much of my personal time.",5
Thank you for allowing me to use your…,"Very pleased with our last agent Patricia Keith. And most pleased with the outcome of having some financial help.   I gave an average rating only because during the -recess we had three different agents. And the actual lender was not Lendio (understandable because of the volume, but a minus just the same. The biggest complaints would be with the website that didn’t allow for updating data and seemed a mystery to agents who were asking for updates that couldn’t be done. And the last, a small but quizzical thing, was the loan was $50 less without an explanation. All in all pleased to have help for a couple months paying my employee.",4
So professional and on time,Lendio facilitated the miracle my business needed and for that I’ll forever be grateful.,5
Great experience very helpful,It was the most horrendous experience. I would not use Lendio again,5

What you all did for me saved my small…,"I’m trying to hold back the tears, but I’m grateful to the people at Lendio for helping me. Being a small business owner without a standard business account & no established relationships with a bank, I just gave up on trying to get a loan myself after denial after denial. All I can say is THANKYOU💕, it’s been a long time since someone helped me period! Let alone not asking for anything in return 🙏🏽",5
Great job,"The electronic application process was simple and user friendly, then I received alot of back-office communication and support.  My only issue was dealing with multiple representatives during the closing phase.  I received email and texts from different people that seemed to be disconnected from one another.  We got that figured out though and all ended well.",5
I so happy with Lendio very…,The whole process was very user-friendly. Lendio found a lender to fit my needs almost immediately.,5
There were a few bumps in the road but…,Thank you so much for an easy process to apply for both of my PPP loans.  It has helped me tremendously since Covid has made me use up all of my savings.  I'm hoping for a better year this year!,5
Laura was Awesome,"Efficient, helpful and no hassleVery professional",5
Great work,When I first applied for my loan the customer service was great. I then had questions as my application kept needing documents re-uploaded and data would go by delaying my application. I signed loan documents but didn’t get funded for weeks and tried to get assistance. When I did apparently a document that was in the portal never made it to the lender. When the Lendio person finally got back to me to tell me that it was a week after I sent three emails and made three phone calls. It would be great if you needed to hire additional people to handle the customer service needs. I know there are a lot of people looking for jobs.,5
You guys was fast and great,"Process took way longer than necessary;Hooked us up with a lender, Ready Capital, who still hasn’t funded our loan and refuses to communicate with us. This has been going on for over 2 months;I have colleagues who went from application to fully funded in 15 days (using other platforms). This has been a complete joke.",5

My experience was great,"Lendio was very good to work with for the PPP Loan but, I was mainly disappointed on not receiving the funds on the gross but on the net. Changed representative for the company twice within one week about my loan, not good. i apply for $20,000 and only received $6,400 on the 1st loan and why couldn't they apply the total amount not clear. When can I apply for the 2nd PPP Loan? Keith P. Ross",5
Fast and great communication.,There were too many times I had to resend my information & was never contacted by the same person. Each time it was someone different & made it very confusing. It seem like I had to reapply several times which delayed my loan.,5

Happy customer,Could never get in touch with nobody Hard to get loan No one never  called back or responded Unprofessional,5
Excellent service,I had a hard time getting anyone to respond and people working on my account kept changing.,5
Exellent service all the time,"My first round PPP application with Lendio went wonderful and smooth.  A great experience.  This second round PPP application with Lendio had constant problems on their end.  They kept changing the application and I had to re-do it (thanks to the SBA changing the rules).  I had a number of other problems with the application process as well.I just had a wonderful chat with the company co-founder and Vice President (he called me!)I am VERY IMPRESSED with him and our conversation.  Not only did he own the problems I had (some of which were the fault of the SBA), but he was genuinely kind and empathetic to my experience.  I can appreciate that none of us are perfect (including me) and we make mistakes or things just happen.  Unfortunately my second round application was an unintended target for problems.I can still recommend Lendio.  If you have issues, be patient and follow up.  Problems are not what typical happens with them (look at other reviews).",5
Great overall customer service,"Quick and easy process.No stress, highly recommend them for your lending needs.",5
Fairly simple process.,Lendio made the process simple and stress free. I filled out the application and provided the requested documents. The application was really simple and straight forward.  The next day I got an email saying my loan had been approved and within a few days the money had been deposited in my account. It could not have been easier or less stressful.My thanks to all at Lendio. Based on my experience with them I would highly recommend Lendio to anyone looking for a business loan.,4
The process went smooth,"Very fast,friendly and professional workers I already recommended my friends Thanks",5
My experience was pretty seamless,I applied with many sights for my ppp loan draw 1 but lendio got me approved much faster than the others and held my hand every step of the way. I highly recommend,5

Lendio was a great company to work…,Despite having a 20 year old relationship with my bank they told me they could not help with PPP loan. Lendio was able to process loan and had money in a few weeks. They recently processed my second PPP loan with no problem . I highly recommend this company.,5

Thank you Dave McG,Fast. Easy.  Best lender ever!,5
Lendio was supportive,"Lendio helped us secure our first and  second PPP Loan.  On the second one, the application was completed and within one week, we had a lender who advised us that SBA had approved our loan.

We completed the docusign on 3/8 and still have not received funds.  Today is 3/19/21.  I finally received an email from someone at Lendio AFTER the docusign was completed but they never replied again despite multiple attempts to reach them.",3

That was the best I Ever  choose I got…,It has been 38 days since my loan was approved with the SBA. The lender is Ready Capital. They are not sending it.And Lendio can’t do anything to help me. What a joke.,5
Seamless support,"I was actually coming off the rather bad experience with another online bank that was non-communicative. When my accountant recommended Lendio I was excited, the app was Straightforward and easy to navigate. Most importantly they had an agent contact me by phone- A Real Human Being- to ask me for a document I needed and then she followed up with an email. I felt like someone was looking out for me and shepherding me through the process. A week later I received my full PPP loan. It was such a relaxing relief to work with Lendio. I can’t recommend them highly enough!!",5

I was worried it would be like the first time I applied at a different place and they kept asking for docs I had already sent...when finally it all expired and I missed out. Not the case with Lendio...they asked for the docs and then I got approved. 2 weeks later they asked for one more doc from the lender. Once they got it, I was doc signed the next day and received my funds 2 days later....they really saved the day. The rep Randall was amazing.",5

Excellent service,"Great job by all! Very responsive! Everything went well as planned! Took a little longer than we expected but the end result saved our boo...tay! I don’t believe it was there fault as these people have thousands of PPP Loan applications to process. The best thing you can do for yourself is be responsive, get them what they need ASAP!

Lendio was very easy to work with,The whole lending process was quick and easy.  I would definitely use Lendio again.  Thanks a bunch Lendio!!!,5
Thank you,"At the beginning, getting a PPP loan didn’t sound so bad especially with companies like Lendio claiming that it’s a fast and easy process. However, that wasn't my case. I uploaded my application sometime around January. A month later (Feb 5), I received my SBA number. Then I get an email from my funding manager saying that my lender wants to me to update my application, which I did and she gladly sent it to the lender. This is where it started to go down hill. I couldn’t log into my account so I called and emailed multiple times, with no one either responding or not knowing why I couldn’t login. I had to change my password on multiple occasions just to see what was going on and to find that I had no funding manager. It took over a month for someone to even tell me that it was being manually reviewed and that I would hear from someone very soon. After that my account was locked so I couldn’t do anything about it (which I understand but I would have still liked to see the progress). After waiting for so long, I finally hear back from Lendio today saying that they can’t submit my application to the SBA because of funding and validation protocols... I already had my SBA number and it was (and still is) active, my funds just weren’t distributed. I need the loan in order to help pay rent and keep my business going or else I have to move out of my apartment. I’m a college student who is working her hardest to get through school and to keep my business running so I can at least pay for rent. This was the most frustrating and stressful thing I have ever experienced in my life and that’s saying something considering I’m double majoring. Now I'm finding a different lender that can get my funding to me quickly and easily. Lendio you need to fix something or a lot of businesses like mine will suffer more than they are right now.",5
Excellent service,I had a great experience and lendio is the define of professional. Thank you,5

I'm thankful for the whole team that…,Dustan Speth was a great help to process the 2nd PPP application.,5
Very helpful,"UPDATE: This company are full of lies!! No one has contacted me, I’ve been sending emails and calling Lendio. I signed documents on 3/3/2021 and have not been funded. They claim to have funded me and that’s a lie. Lendio is forcing us into bankruptcy. This company is ridiculous. Lendio is extremely unorganized, confusing and misleading. They are also using a lender, Ready Capital, where they are both seemingly manipulating not only me but other business owners. Not a single person in this company has knowledge of solutions or problem solving. I’ve spoken to at least 11 different people and there is still no beneficial results. I’ve been 100% patient and overly understanding. However, Lendio will be the cause of my staff suffering lost of funds and non payment. This is not a game. Lendio is treating I and others like PPP is a joke and non-urgent. Lendio’s staff never has an answer for me. I’ve completed everything needed. My status has been saying funded for over 2 weeks. I have not been funded and Lendio called me today to ask REFINANCE questions on my very first PPP loan. There’s no way I should be having a refinance conversation on a first draw that hasn’t even been credited to my bank account. Lendio is a lost, problematic company. I hate I trusted them with my business. It’s disappointing and damaging to both parties.",5
Using Lendio was quick and easy,They have almost ZERO communication during the loan process. Emailed them many times and rarely received any kind of response.They replied about responding. I sent probably 15-20 emails--most of which were never answered. They (occasionally) respond to an email. You can't call anyone either.I signed paperwork (online) for the loan and it took quite a while before it was ever funded. I was emailing about when to expect funding and got one reply saying it was already funded when it wasn't in my account. It mysteriously showed up about a week later.They have almost ZERO communications regardless of what their reply says.,5
Wonderful  service,"Great job, you guys walked me through the loan process help me secure a loan and I thank you for that.",5
My loan officer was very responsive and…,"I am a restaurant owner that originally submitted my application for the PPP loan in October but I had to wait for the next round. In February I posted a negative review but removed it because a rep contacted me and stated that they would improve their service and asked if I would remove my review. However, it is still difficult to get in touch with people. I’ve had to resubmit my info because some how it went missing. I’ve had different account managers and everyone seems clueless. And my application has been in “sending to lender” status for weeks now. I also held on thinking my application would get pushed through with the 2 weeks that was dedicated to small businesses under 20 employees but nothing happened. Now that I know the ppp program is being extended I went ahead and withdrew my application and will apply with a different company. Lendio is a horrible company. It’s sad because many businesses are trying to receive this loan just stay afloat.",5
Excellent,Excellent service got my money on time great help for business,5
Good,everything when very smoothly in this process.,5
Great fast and efficient,"Repetitive requests for the SAME documents.  Phone calls asking me to call them back, no return number left in the message and pressing ""redial"" yielded message, ""...the number you have dialed..."".   Updates to the online file were acknowledged as ""received"" then a week later had reverted to the previously saved version.  The rotation and quantity of handlers on the file was like a revolving door -- handle something ONCE, handle it CORRECTLY and handle it completely -- it would save time and frustration for everyone.  If you want uploaded files labeled/titled a certain way, tell us in ADVANCE of us uploading it not after we have uploaded documents then have to go back and relabel.  Create a field for ""Business Address"" and ""Mailing Address"" -- there is a difference for many companies.   Shall I continue?",5
Great,The staff was was quite helpful in arranging  the loan. They gave particular attention through a couple of small glitches and everything worked out in the end. Thanks!,4
Got approved,Quick start to process. Good communication and quick response from specialists. Good PPP education tools. The only issue was two files created for me in error thus I received duplicate emails regarding the process. Think this ultimately delayed the entire process. Not sure if it was an error on Lendio or Ready Capital. Overall a good transaction.,5
I most definitely recommend!!,They worked fast in helping me get funds for my business thank you,5
Quick turn around,Extremely helpful throughout entire process,5
Simple instruction and good follow up.,Terrible I have not received funds even though it says I have and it’s been more than 10 business daysFunds were released into wrong account not mine and I am having to wait for them to be reissued.... once two more days pass then what? Does that mean ready capital is a scam????,4
I’ve very great full for lendio they…,"I applied for a PPP Loan in January of 2020. I know Lendio was likely dealing with requirements changing, but it seemed like every week I was getting an email about submitting more documents. No one ever called me, even when I asked them to and made appointments. My loan manager changed every other day, so it was hard to find out what was going on. I did finally get contacted by Benworth Capital, but I had to question them first because no one notified me that I would be contacted by them or that they funded the approved loans. It was honestly the most confusing and frustrating process I’ve ever gone through. I did finally receive my loan last week, but I have no paperwork to go along with it. It’s all slightly unsettling",5
Application Process,"Catherine.Schnock was my loan manager & she went above & beyond, every time i had a question, she researched them in depth & got back to me asap with answers called me & emailed during the entire process. I am surprised how she was able with so many other loan loads she had.Also the general customer service employees were the best of their kind.

Due to the changing nature of the PPP…,"I am very disappointed with Lendio. They would not correct the errors on my PPP loan application. They knew about the corrections needed and didn’t do anything. I worked on this for months. I ended up contacting the lender and the corrections was done! Lendio kept telling me that I was approved for $2700.00. Finally after contacting the lender, I was approved for $20833.00. A BIG DIFFERENCE! I will never use Lendio again. They have the worst customer service! I have emails to prove this!",5
They were helpful in guiding me through…,"Lendio came through for me in these hard times. I know they had so many applications and that's why it took a lil bit longer of a process for me but they did keep me in touch and updated me.

Good service  excellent,I was encouraged to apply for a PPP via my CPA but I really didn't think I would have a chance with all the big corporations swallowing all of the funds during the first stimulus.   But you guys were encouraging and the funds will really help a great deal.   Thank you very much.  Jed,5

I will never go through lendio again,Lendio processed my PPP loan very efficient and professionally.Thank you guys!,1
Very  patient  an super helpful!!!,"Lendio is probably the worst company to work with for the PPP loans. No one in the company knows what is going on and it has been over two months and my 2 remaining PPP loans remain in limbo. Not one person who is hired as a temp has any idea of what the hell is going on. You are playing with companies survival. As of today, I had to pull my remaining PPP loan applications because of the lack of faith I have with Lendio. I would NEVER recommend this company even to my worst enemy. There is no care or empathy for what is happening in the world, you are ONLY looking at dollar signs and fake out the customer that you are a valid company.",5
They were spot on,A company who keeps their word. Company that we can count on because they always did what they said they would.,5

If you need help reach out to him!!",5
Awful experience,I appreciate Lendio supporting my business with the 2nd draw of the PPP program. I only wish it was a little easier to reach someone live that I can call to ask questions. Our first draw seemed easy to reach an Amex Rep.,1

Awesome customer service,Lendio made applying for PPP money very easy!  From their online forms to keeping me informed along the way.,5
Great customer service,"Summary: Lendio is easily the worst organized company I have ever dealt with.I documented the process. It includes 70+ comms with 15 people. It took them 55 days to fund my loan. They applied twice and misplaced the first approval. That approval blocked me from using another lender (obstruction) including their own second attempt. It took 54 communications to learn of my first approval, 4 weeks after it was granted. Another 20 comms to get the money.I tried to upload the entire text of my docs but trustpilot limits the length. Here's the first portion. Jan 15 email from Lendio:It looks like something isn’t quite right...Business tax returns 941 documents Include bank statements.My Response:I logged in, verified all items are present. I reviewed what I uploaded to ensure it was complete. I reuploaded where lendio thinks the files are missing (even though I can see them in Lendio).Jan 20 email from Tashima BPlease make sure your Lendio PPP application is complete.My Response:Logged in, verified it's all there still.Jan 20 email from Tashima B:your application has been submitted and now being reviewed.My Response:Phone call to confirm.

Process was simple and I received a…,Great to work with!  Very quick to respond and updated me throughout the process.  I was very impressed!,5
This was a smooth process,"I had given up on the possibility of getting an SBA loan because my business was actually a small business. The first round of SBA loans went to very large corporations and small companies like mine were overlooked. My Lendio rep reassured me that I did indeed qualify and just needed to get my paperwork submitted. Lo and behold, I received an SBA loan and my company will most likely be saved. If it hadn't been for the Lendio representatives persistence and reassurance, I would not have received that important lifeline SBA loan. Can't thank you enough!",5

I completed that task and then there was no communication. I emailed I called I complained but no one was listening or responded. Finally after three weeks I got a new rep assigned to me but we still didn’t get answers. I finally called my bank that referred me to them and he said “yes you are funded and put the money in my account the next day. Why is it so hard for Lendio to answer people???,5
Great service,"Overall its been a great experience it was easy uploading documents ,Great customer service. Thank you guys!",5
Simply great,"I applied for a loan and the process was fairly easy and straight-forward. I called for assistance one and was helped swiftly. Had to upload documents, but it worked well.",5
Great experience!,"The process was simple, easy to follow, and moved along at a consistent pace. When I had questions or concerns, there was always a rep to help with guidance. Great experience all the way along!",5
Awesome!!!,"I don't know if I should say Lendio is the best lending institution out there since I have no experience with other lenders. However, from my experience, I could not have asked better.  The customer service is outstanding.  I qualified for a fixed amount of loan while I wanted more. Lendio went ahead on their own re-examined the terms and conditions to provide me a wiggle room by lowering the rate and slightly increasing the loan and the term.  This approval was agreed for being in the business for just less than a year.  For a brand new business in its 1st year this arrangement is almost impossible if it is, the interest rate is on the roof.  That's why I signed up with Lendio for the PPP loan that they facilitated and I also just got.  I strongly recommend Lendio for your loan needs.  Sincerely, Theo",5
Lendio's process was very simple and…,"Lendio app is a disaster. I did my first app with Kabbage, which was awesome, but since they were bought out I had to find some place else. If the Lendio app had a better design and flow there would be no need for customer service, which Lendio is not the best with. I had to reach out several times :/",5

My representative at Lendio explained…,"Team at lendio is great to work with, they helped me navigate with ease to apply for second draw of ppp funds and got me aproved.",4
In A Time Of Need,My banker at Chase recommended that I look into online lenders to navigate the PPP. I filled out the application and began the process of collecting the required documents and a loan helper was assigned to my application immediately. I was able to call and e-mail this person and it felt like I had a guardian angel helping me navigate the documentation requirements. It took some time but we received our loan and we are over the moon happy and feel secure to keep our business going and paychecks in our employees pockets. I could not be more happy with my experience with Lendio. Thank you so much!,5
Well done,The Teams that worked on both my loans obviously worked very hard on my behalf.The Website could have be a bit clearer and been more detailed in describing what each step in the process was about.I would definitely go to Lendio again and recommend others for any financial loan needs,5

Prompt Service,This was an easy and efficient company to work with. If I have any future needs I will be back.,5
Not a positive experience,"Lendio's post lending experience is a huge concern. I did my initial PPP loan through this site. For the 2nd go around, I did not qualify for PPP, however they kept sending me emails saying ""You need to submit your documents for your loan,"" The problem is, this made it sound like they wanted forgiveness documents for my existing loan, however it was really for a new loan as I questioned it and clarified this with my rep from the first loan. Essentially they wanted me to apply for a new loan without having me realize it. My proof on this is they would send me first time emails with ""Re:"" in the subject line, I believe this is a violation of the CAN-SPAM act. I constantly reported this to my rep for the 1st loan and nothing was done about it. Their practices concern me and appear to be intentionally deceptive. I have enough proof of this, the questionable emails were constant until I put my foot down on them and demand they stop.",1
Couldnt be happier with Lendio and how…,Great customer service! I had wonderful phone and email communications from Lendio representatives and help to gather the necessary items that I needed to complete my forms. The reps were very pleasant and helpful.

Great customer service and proficient…,"Update April 1 2021: after 35 days in caweb and no funds I successfully cancelled with lendio and was funded with a different company. Up until then I got the same, generic messages that it would be handled. Thankful to PayPal for getting through and funding us, I’m assuming they were able because the loan was a month old and not funded.Lendio is now having my review flagged as false. I submitted all documentation showing that my claims are in fact valid and I did have a loan with lendio but they never followed through. As of today 4/1 the loan was cancelled in caweb. Yesterday it was still showingActive not funded. I was contacted a week ago stating they tried submitting to SBA for a 5th time but PayPal got through and got us a number. I was disappointed that 30 days in caweb, I was finally getting a call for resolution but fortunately it was too late as another lender actually delivered. Update!!: after 35 days in caweb and no funds I successfully cancelled with lendio and was funded with a different company. Up until then I got the same, generic messages that it would be handled. Thankful to PayPal for getting through and funding us, I’m assuming they were able because the loan was a month old and not funded.Lendio is now having my review flagged as false.

"Great Company ,amazing customer service…",Lendio was very informative and helpful.,5
Very quick and easy processing,"Very good mostly, some confusion with multiple people reaching out to me and my not knowing who they were and whether they were someone I should be sharing information with. My actual loan person, Tylere Jackson was great! Others sent me emails and I didn't actually work with them or know who they were. A little disconcerting. I don't want to give out information to anyone randomly.Thank you for all your help. We do appreciate all your hard work in making this happen. Mary",3
Poor customer service,"Initially my experience with Lendio was great, the application process was easy and didn’t take long at all. I was impressed by customer service reaching out to check in. Once I was approved for the loan I had to sign closing documents three times and it seemed like customer service didn’t have much communication with the lender and couldn’t give me details of why this was happening. I did eventually get funded and everything worked out. I suggest better communication with the lenders you are brokering with. Despite this experience I would use your service again.",2
Easy to work with,"Getting a PPP loan was easy, fast and efficient with Lendio. I had no success with my usual bank and the process was time-consuming. With Lendio, it was easy to apply and to understand. Great follow-through too.",5
I would strongly recommend Lendio…,"I'm convinced the good reviews for lendio on Trustpilot are fake and by robots. I applied over two weeks ago and was never assigned a loan number or lender as I learned today after speaking with a rep.  After the application submission, I noticed that I was never sent a confirmation email with details of an assigned funding manager. It wasn't until I called in, did I receive her name. I also could never log in to the portal. When I called about this issue, they said I had misspelled my email. Yea right! I would never misspell my email! Total lies. I noticed another reviewer also said that they told them the same thing. I provided a different email and still could not log in to the portal.  I thought Lendio would be quicker than my bank and is the primary reason I went here. They were not! I got nothing but a waste of time from Lendio.Update: I've learned that Lendio flagged my review. It's unbelievable that they would go to such lengths to keep their shady practices hidden. It appears this is standard practice for them to do so with the negative reviews that they receive. Once they flag it and the customer does not provide proof, Trustpilot sets the review to invisible. This is how they are able to maintain a rating over 4 stars.I forgot to mention that about four days after application submission, I experienced theft from my personal bank account.",5
So very grateful for the help no issues…,"Great results: we received the loan. Application process and communication, though, was torturous. I was requested at least 4 times to upload the same documents, and to reenter some partial information at nauseam. I had no idea if my application was even in until we received the loan. Again, grateful for that, but I've had root canals that were less painful.",5
Lendio is very easy to work with,"I would not recommend Lendio to anyone. Although we finally getting our loan but we had to go through tremendous rig•ma•role. I was recommended by our payroll company that we have been doing business with for some times. Lendio’s loan operation is purely on internet. They came back with multiple tiny issues with the applications that I had to run through and find. Loan agents, their phone numbers and email addresses are useless as they never reply.",5
Easy to work with and very helpful,Always excellent service and friendly customer service.,5

I called right away and spoke with a representative and explained my situation and then I asked them what should since i did not get the 45,000 dollars. She told me and this conversation is being recorded to go a head and sign and she was going to have a Mr Acosta contact me to help me out, well no one called. I called again and spoke with another rep and she told me a man named Landon would call me back he didn’t, it really appears nobody cares. I have made less money then I did before when I applied. I am in need of the 45,000 because my work is slow. PLEASE can someone help me. 404 520 6222",4

Excellent service,Excellent service and customer communication.,5
Great company that answers quickly and…,"There was very little communication as to what was happening with my PPP loan.  I would talk to different people, always requesting more info.  I was never told by Lendio who or when I was going to get my loan.  It finally come from the bank that gave me the loan.",5
Great Customer Service,The application process was quick and to the point. They only requested documents that were necessary for the PPP. Customer service called me when the application was accepted. I was fully funded in a couple of days. It was a pleasure working with Lendio.,5
Fast and Reliable,your service is great! Its is my Bank First Horizon has put a hold on half of my loan and will not release the money back to me. I have sent them my business License and Taxes but they still haven't release the rest of the money.,5
The process was easy and simple  and…,"Lendio was the only place that was there and available for me for the first draw PPP loan when my bank Wells Fargo would not attempt to help, or worse, not even return my emails or calls. I gladly used Lendio for my 2nd PPP loan and although there were some glitches and adjustments that had to be made, they came through again. The application process, portal and flow was easy. I would definitely use them again and would highly recommend them for any small business.  Lendio saved my business twice now, and I’m forever grateful.",5
Lendio walked me step by step on what…,"The agent who helped me get my first loan first round ppp, won't return my calls or emails for the next step of applying the second draw ppp.",5
I got my PPP loan through Lendio,Thanks for all your help in a difficult moment!!!,5
Great Customer Service,"It was Great Experience, They Really look out for Small Businesses like My Own",5
Very responsive and the instructions…,I so far have been satisfied with the way I was taken care of. The only thing that I would like to talk about is that I was told a number amount and when the final amount sent was about 75% less . But happy with overall experience.,5
I thought the loan process with Lendio…,Very bed .I never been back used to apply .,4
Good job,Lendio Came through for my small business!,5
Super easy to work with!,The process was excellent. The service was excellent.,5

Excellent service,"Thank you so much, the process was seamless.",5
All went very well based on the more…,They were always there to give us an answer in these uncertain times.  We are very grateful for your help,5
Great customer service,The process was easy for the PPP 2 loan. It took about a month to be approved but well worth the wait. Staff was courteous and reminded me of things needed or missing. Kudos to them.,5
They were very good to work with…,"Very easy, Fast process and very responsive.  I got funded in 8 days.  Everything will go smooth if you give the proper documents,  it’s as simple as that.  I recommend lendio for everyone to use.",5
Very helpful and professional,"Ultimately, I applied through Lendio, and got my PPP funded. And I know businesses were under a lot of stress to process PPP applications. But I was assigned 6 different ""funding managers"" over 3 weeks, and had trouble getting information out of any of them. Only got movement when I emailed the COO about the bad communications. Even after funding, the bad communications continued - with 6 emails in 2 days after my PPP had been deposited — telling me i was declined, then not declined, then so close, then incomplete, then complete.",5
The Lendio application process was…,"You were quite clear and timely in your communications and the progression of our loan application. While the process Of gathering the information was probably the most difficult, your portal made it easy to get the required documents off to you. Nice job, We were able to get two employees back to work!",4
As advertised,The customer service is great I received my loan in about 2 weeks tops they are very thorough and customer focused and professional.my experience working with them was awesome.,5
Lendio is a great option for arranging your funding needs.,"Was very easy to apply, and always was just a phone call or email away from getting answers to any questions.",5
The entire process was very easy.,Prompt service. A rep is there to help you throughout. Unlike some of the other dubious PPP providers.,5
Very excellent service,"The application process was simple and easy to navigate thru.  Lendio & Ready Capital processed my PPP2 in about a month.  I still give them 5 stars however communication couldve been a little better.  They did respond to emails either the same day or next, but they appeared to be generic responses.  Overall i was satisfied with the process.",5
Would highly recommend Lendio,"I just love the whole process, quick and I received a good service",5
Great experience as the entire…,service was great,5
Great communication,Communication is weak but they got the job done,5
This company is good and quick to act,A team really interested in providing a helpful assistance.,5
Great job,"Do not use this company. Terrible customer service. Inaccurate FAQs and zero help. I applied for funds on Jan 11,2021. I received funds on Mar 8. Despite having received my Sba Feb 17 and zero contact until I make a complaint via BBBYou mean I called and received zero information. As reported in my BBB complaint.",5
Quick n simple process,"Excellent service. Friendly & very helpful agents. Process was quick, with no surprises. Everything needed from me was laid out in language and terms that were very easy to understand.",5
They where great at helping me out…,The worst at replying back to emails and phone calls. Spoke with at least six representatives and all assured me paperwork was fine but one after another said I was missing something. It took almost two months to receive PPP funding when others received immediately. Now I’m in jeopardy of not getting second draw and losing much needed funds.,5
Great customer service,"Thank you Lendio! It wasn't always clear where I was in the process, or what the timetable and roadmap were, but in the end it all came through effortlessly.",5
Lendio help me to get the PPP Loan so…,Great experience! Very helpful and attentive! Highly recommend especially for first timers like myself! Cant go wrong using them!,5
Professional and efficient service,I gave Lendio a try and I was impressed.  Easy to work with and great tech platform for uploading info needed to get the loan.  I have since referred several people to Lendio and all of them have had great success.  I recommend highly.,5
Supported me better than my own bank.,"You guys are an absolute God send. Seriously, everyone I dealt with were great! Special shout out to Kelly! She really went out of way in my opinion to help me out. I really want her to get the credit because without her I don't think I would have stuck out the process of applying for the loan although we really needed it. Kelly was kind, understanding and more importantly very knowledgeable. I owe my successful application to Kelly. Thank you so much. I have recommended  Lendio to at least three other buddies of mine that are in the same line of work. I tell everyone that will listen that you guys are the way to go if they are serious about getting their loan approved.",5
Very satisfied with the whole process,Very fast and easy! Great interface too.,5
Very quick and easy,Great company to do business with. I received great service and immediate answers to my questions with a direct contact that was super helpful.,5
Poor communication,I was satisfied with how quickly the process went and was authorized. I recommend this company for anyone looking to get a loan.,1

PPP app,Just super happy to have the Lendio team on my side.,4
Excelent Service,Lendio was very repsonsive.,5
It took some time but they kept in…,"Over all good and friendly experience.  First time, my application had a wrong name that delayed the funding and had to redo everything. But Jay was excellent in staying over my case and get me approval and kept in contact at every step.  His supervisor who connected me with Jay was super helpful (I can't recall his name). I would recommend lendio to others for sure.",5
Perfect and recommended for all,It took some time for me to get my PPP Loan (almost a month) but once I received my final loan promissary documents I was funded within 48 hours! Lendio even called me several times to make sure that I did receive my loan documents & my PPP funds. Thank-you for all of your hard work! My small business really needed this funding.,5
Excellent service.,You only can get in touch with you loan assistant when information is needed on your behalf and they adjust monthly accurate income amounts to lower monthly income which lower your PPP amount.,5
Great to work with,Excellent! Every step an advisor was always their as needed had answer to all my questions. Their was no hassle no problem what so ever funding was quick n simple . Thanks Lendio Team your cooperation would be number 1 to  be recommended to others,5

Great customer service!,Everything ran pretty smooth it just took a while to get the final result,5
IT TOOK 6 TRIES AND YOU LOST THE INFO 5…,Lendio stepped in when my personal bank of 20 years and my business bank of 7 years stonewalled me and would not do anything but make excuses regarding PPP loans.  They even helped me better understand what I would need to do to qualify my loan for forgiveness.  I highly recommend using Lendio!,2
Really proffesional  people,I did not make the first deadline. Lendio kept me updated on funding and documentation requirements as they came available. The government should let private equity like Lendio design and engineer the system by which these funds are handled. They were great to deal with as well as available by phone.ThanksGJ,5
Thanks for all your help,"I applied to two different PPP lenders for the first and second draw.  The first one was a mess that I am still working to straighten out with a constantly crashing website, and one hour hold times.  The second was Lendio.  They are the definition of smooth and easy to use!",5
Dawn is the best she got my loan fast!!!,Our Lendio agent was the only live person that we could get hold of inn this frustrating process. The actual lender was terrible--but we got funded!,5
This company is great,Thank you so much for your support and service!,5
The service was impeccable not to…,"We applied for round 2 PPP with Lendio instead of our bank. Lendio jumped on the new round immediately, held a very informative webinar, and the process didn't take as long as round 1 did with our large bank. Only reason we didn't give 5 stars: if there are specific questions or issues, the platform is all online and getting connected with the correct answer can be complicated. If you expect that, it was a very good provider and process, and we are very satisfied with the outcome.",5
"Best company ever! Super fast, quick and efficient!!",The loan process was incredibly smooth. Each step was clear. The paperwork was easy and streamlined. Communication was efficient responsive. I could always get someone on the phone when I needed them. Thanks for such great service!,5
My loan agent was awesome,"It would have been easy to get lost in the wave of applicants, but our representative named Michelle kept us informed. This is my second PPP experience with Lendio. Both have been a positive experience, and both have been successful. I owe a huge thanks to Lendio for that.",5

First class service,"Lendio was quick, easy, and most importantly, extremely communicative!! I also applied through Bluevine— whom I spent hours on the phone TRYING to get through to... and whose application process you cannot even go back in... among other things... Whereas with Lendio, I got an email, a text, AND a super friendly call from my assigned loan agent, Sidney, who checked in to let me know what else was needed to complete my application as well as answering any questions I might have had (which were quite a few actually). I spoke to a person with a company to more times throughout the process both times work quick direct and they really took the time to explain everything that was happening. Thanks Lendio!!",5
They worked for my loan very fast and…,Great service nice follow up,5
They responded quickly and followed up…,I am so very lucky and blessed to have found lendio they have helped me when it was needed the most got me funding for my business and made it possible for me to not only survive but to thrive and grow in the time of a pandemic I would definitely suggest anyone and everyone to use lendio if they ever need funding for anything they are the best at what they do,5

Great experience,"Lendio has excellent staff, they treat you with respect and are very understanding.",5
easy  faster,"Horrible horrible will never use them again, we were approved by SBA they kept blaming the lender we sat for 4 weeks waiting for our funds we ended up going direct to lender to get our funds worst experience ever do not use them!",5
Very easy,"I would have given 5 stars except for the slightly frustrating interaction with the actual lender - took a month to fund after signing the loan documents. That was due to the overwhelming work load, but more communication would have been nice. Lendio walks through the application process very well and document upload is easy and intuitive.",5
They were helpful and great throughout!,Lendio made the loan process smooth and easy.  I couldn't have asked for a more pleasant experience!,5

Five stars service,"Amazing UI, application process and submission. Quick and efficient finding ensuring my business can remain open and operational!!!Thank you for your help:)",5
The agents are very responsive and…,"We applied on the first day of the PPP program and Lendio has tied up our loan with an assigned SBA number in other words it is locked to them.  It has been in this state, as ""approved by one of their lenders"" for over a month and they just send me template boilerplate emails that tell be almost nothing.  They call me from time to time but the person I talk to addmitedly does not know and cannot help.  By any measure, we are a clear cut easy to qualify business.  If I go to another bank I will have lost 2 months.  My regular bank has said that Lendio will need to release it from the SBA before they can processing a new application.  I do not want to start over and the program is about to expire.  Reply:  Lendio has done nothing to assist.  I had to go elsewhere and begin the process over.",5

I have everything ready and he gives no response via telephone or email.I noticed on your reply that you mentioned I got funded on March 9. That was incorrect. I was funded February 26.The reason for the 3 stars was the only reason I could hear back from lendio was to write here on trustpilot.com.  Why couldn’t you just respond on the platform. You leave a phone number and email of the lendio representative that’s working on our case but they never respond. However, when I wrote here you have responded (3) times!....wouldn’t you agree inner company training is needed to accommodate responses to your clients?",5

The service was A1,Their forms were very simple to fill out and their communication in regards to the application process was excellent.,5
Trustworthy and knowledgeable - Great to work with!,"Here I am, back nearly 2 weeks later! How is this company even in business? All they do is lie and lead you on. They will request additional documents over and over and over again, making you think that they're working on your loan. If you ever actually get to speak with someone they'll tell you ""everything looks good, just waiting on the lender."" A few days later you will get an email asking for additional documents. This is the game they play. I finally decided enough is enough and asked them to withdraw my application and release the SBA loan number a few days ago. Mason my funding manager assured me that he would take care of it and that my loan number would be released. Fast forward to today; I receive an email from Lendio ""REQUESTING ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS!"" ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Lendio, quit playing games with people's lives! Quit lying and actually do what you say you're going to do! You also lied to Trust Pilot saying my previous review was ""not genuine"" trying to get them to remove it. As you can see, the review is still there and also VERIFIED! I want my application withdrawn and the SBA loan number attached to my name released immediately!",5

Great service,It was challenging to get a hold of anyone to answer questions. I was sent the same document 8 times to sign with no explanation of why. As I tried to follow up I left several messages and after a week and a half I finally got a call back but with no reason as to why I kept signing the same document. I was asked for several documents that I don't have as a small business. The process was harder than it needed to be. But in the end I did finally get the money.,5

Best service,Lendio was very effcient on both communication and processing applications.,5
Thank you so much,"Not sure why Lendio is asking for a 5star review when the whole ppp process was made a nightmare by them. To the point that I had to speak to the actual lending bank(Legacy Bank-Oklahoma) to get my application out of stall and me funded. No one at Lendio answers the phone and when they do answer, they are quick to blame the bank for the holdup. Which is total BS!This next round of PPP, I think I will deal with Legacy bank directly instead of going through Lendio as I’m sure the next time will be the same circle jerk.",5

Join with Lendio is the best choice,From the time I submitted my PPP application to the time I was funded was roughly 2 weeks. They kept me updated daily through my online portal. I love Lendio! Thanks for helping my business get funded during these trying times!,5
Awsome service,"Lendio was very helpful getting my PPP loan. Simple hassle free process. I like the dashboard where I was able to follow the application processed. The outcome was, easy closing of my loan. Thanks.",5
Awesome,"Highly recommend Lendio.com.  Very responsive, professional, and knowledgable!",5
This is the best company and customer…,"I was overwhelmed that during the process,  i had a contact to write toas i was filing out the forms. When Lendio needed more info,theycontact me several times until the PPP loan was filed..  Very impressive..  Easier knowing there was someone to help.Then they contacted me when it was going to fund..  They made it easy for me during these difficult times.",5
Using Lendio for my PPP loan was fast…,"Y’all were helpful, just little slow on the process part of it, but maybe that’s just the way it is. Really don’t have any complaints just glad everything worked out!!",5
Excellent service,"Very kind spoken over the phone, always follows up with you regarding any concerns, highly recommended",5
Exelent Service,All in all got the job done with my PPP application and loan.   But there was and still is a lag in response time.  Also throughout the process my Lendio representative changed quite a few times which didn’t help.,5
Very helpful,Lendo was very responsive and followed up often as my application went thru the approval process.  I would definitely use Lendo again !!,5
I was in doubt prior to my application…,"This is a review of commendation to respectfully inform Lendio representatives assisted me with a first submission for a PPP loan. Nicole Vickroy and Sabrina Martin are phenomenal, very professional, informative and kind! They demonstrated their skill sets to effectively assist with inquiries, questions or concerns!The qualities that they each possess are needed in any setting when providing services and guidance to individuals.  Especially, these qualities are needed most when providing services during these times of the COVID-19 pandemic. As well, these are characteristics that individuals should demonstrate to build a positive rapport with business owners and anyone that is seeking help.Nicole demonstrated patience during my need for additional assistance with inquires as it relates to the updates! It is very evident that Nicole and Sabrina both strive for excellence when providing services! I would like to note it is an honor for me to acknowledge and commend them for their professionalism! Thank you!",5
Very kind and professional,The  Lendio team was amazing helping me get through each step. It was a very easy process.,5
Great with keeping you updated on loan…,I received my funds within 3 weeks with no issues what so ever. Updates were usually on Sunday and so was loan document signing. I never got any updates by email only to sign documents nothing saying I was paid. Lendio contacted me more then once to make sure I got the funds they did a wonderful fast and easy process I would choose them over anyone!,5
Josh helped me every step of the way,Super quick and easy to deal with . They were so helpful,5
These guys were absolutely great to…,W wonderful Company helped me get funded sooo fast!!!,5
Great service,"I submitted my PPP application with all supporting documents and was given a funding manager (which means nothing) who said they had what they needed. After that I was unsuccessful is getting a response from anyone at all, including the various funding managers that were assigned to me. They changed the loan amount with no explanation and when I checked on the status after 2 weeks they asked me to confirm that it was the first draw - information that was obvious.  Another week later and no one is responding, the chat is useless and I am stressed out. I withdrew my application hoping that no lender has been assigned to me and will go to a lender on my own. Don't believe the glowing reviews, they are malarkey.",5
My experience with Lendio was smooth…,Love how fast and sufficient they were with everything,5
"First good, 2nd draw a nightmare",it took a long time for my application to be processed and emails to be answered.Venus was extremely helpful.,1
BEST experience! Super helpful! Came quickly.,"Long story short: STAY AWAYI first submitted my PPP August of 2020. Because of Lendio's incompetence, my application wasn't submitted on time. Now I'm on my SIXTH ""funding manager"" (sidenote: nobody at this company knows what they're/what each other is doing). The last ""manager"" was Eva Young - probably not her real name, but she REASSURED me she would keep me up to date, apologizing profusely about my experience. Well, of course after numerous texts, phone calls, and voicemails, and no response, I was again transferred to a new funding manager named Brett Banner, who AGAIN, is reassuring me he will personally handle my file. I've already had some frustrating interactions with him, so I have ZERO expectations that my PPP application will actually be picked up by a lender. Happy to reconsider if Lendio actually follows through on what it purports to provide.(BTW Eva Young, if you're reading this, you're terrible at your job).",5
Thank you for your help,"Excellent service, very easy and straight forward to apply for a loan.",5
Good service,Excellent job,5
Quick easy application and assistance…,The agents and contact emails were very helpful and the forms easy to use. The entire process was painless. I can't recommend them highly enough.,5
Matt Graham ***** 5 Stars *****,I loved Lendio a great organization to get help with the PPP. As a small business  I really need the help and it was super easy to apply. I also appreciate that they have people to guide you with your needs.,5
Applied with Lendio for 1st draw PPP…,Applying for the ppp was a smooth process; it’s a bit hard to contact the company to confirm agent legitimately.,4
It was great dealing with your people…,Thanks to Lendio I was able to acquire approval for a PPP loan. Something my business desperately needed! I would not have known where to start on my own. Best part is that it was all free. I initially was skeptical because I thought it was too good to be true. But it is a legit company. They did exactly what they promised.,5
Lendio's customer service is raising the bar!,Everything went well. The application process was straightforward. Funding was prompt.,5
Professional Service,"I filled out my application for the second round of PPP a month ago. The account manager initially got in touch with me. Since then my account manager has changed three times and no one will call me back. I trusted them with a very important roll and getting me the second round of PPP money however now I have no idea what the status is of my application and have been left in the dark for a month. Although Lendio replied below about contacting my ""funding manager"", I have already done this, calling and emailing Evan F. ,over a dozen time with not one response. I would suggest applying elsewhere.",5
Excellent experience,"At first the process, like any other, was a bit tedious,  but once all necessary documents were received and approved, it was smooth sailing after. Thank you for your service.",5
We could never speak with anyone on the…,"Lendio is awesome!!!Excellent experience, professional, very knowledgeable, and courteous.",2
Once an issue was resolved with my SBA…,"Lendio was excellent in helping me to secure my second PPP Loan. The place where I received my first one messed things up, but Lenio came through and in just a few days. The process was simple and before I knew it, the money was in my account. Amazing!!",5
This was a smooth transaction,They were able to secure a PPP loan quickly but never returned any of my phone calls or emails. Called the number and always got a voicemail as if this company doesn't exist.,5
They making everything easy and fast,i started the process late and had little hope of obtaining funding.  The document uploading was significant for me.  I felt the requirements were reasonable but still a challenge for me.    The Lendio people always updated me on anything I needed to add or replace due to formatting or wrong item submitted.   I received super email and message updates and easy pushes to keep everything  moving.  This was one of the least stressful and unexpected events in my Pandemic year,5
President,This is the second time I have used Lendio and both times you guys came through for me I know they were times where I had no communication but the customer portal really helped thank you for everything,5
This was my first time applying for any…,"One company that cares and is true to its mission!! After suffering unnecessary delays in getting our PPP loan funded (everything else was completed), I reached out to lendio via Social Media. Lendio’s team including their CEO immediately stepped in & assured me that they’ll escalate it with the lender & get the funding issue resolved immediately. Within a few days, I had funds in my account. Rarely do you find a company that gets involved in ensuring small businesses are able to survive this global pandemic. Kudos to Brock and the entire team at lendio, I am a fan forever!!",5
Great service.,Our representative at Lendio did a fantastic job obtaining financing for our office  during these difficult pandemic times.  We are grateful for all the assistance and responsiveness of the Lendio team!,5
Lendio has been the most professional…,"The overall process was fine, the ability to go in and modify the application was helpful. The initial case manager didn’t seem to have an idea about various company types.",5
Great group,"Although this is a complex loan, Lendio assisted in the process and made it possible for my company to obtain the funding needed.",5
YE. L,"Easy, awesome and fast.Thank you!",5
Thank you Lendio for providing your…,It was a long process but very good services,5
I have not had a good experience with…,It was a real smooth process. Thank you all for your hard work and dedication.,1

Dissatisfied Customer,"I will recommend to my friends for the loan. Very helpful, best service, very easy to follow up. Thank you 🙏 for all the help.",2
My case manager did a good job,You handled my File quickly and efficiently in a very courteous manner. I look forward to working with Lendio again--maybe for the 2nd Draw?,5
Great Process,"My name is Chanell Taylor. I am the owner of Taylor's Stop & Go LLC. The business loan you have provided me helped me through my hardest times being that we are in a pandemic. It helped me keep up with payments to my employees, while also allowing me to buy many of the things I need for my business. I wanted to write a professional and warmed hearted thank you. I am truly grateful and thankful for the opportunity you gave me for my business.",5
Again,Working with Lendio was super fast and really easy. I was able to get my PPP within a few days. 10/10 would recommend!,5
I did finally get my 2nd PPP draw,Lendio seemed eager to work with us and we hope the experience will continue to be quick and efficient as we try to stay in business..... still to be determined.,4
I appreciate you helping my Bisness…,"My ppp loan was processed but it seemed to bounce between a lot of advisors. I got multiple emails from different people, usually asking for the same things, and then would not get a clear answer from any of them if all required documents had been submitted. So, in the end, my loan was approved and processed but it was messy and communications were spotty at best. Also, now trying to get round two funding, and there are problems communicating with the lender. I can't even start the application because I can't get a hold of the lender... and Lendio is saying they have to update the loan as paid in full. It's weird and frustrating.",5
I really enjoy the application process,"Despite being among the first to apply it took until March 3, 2021 to get my 1st loan. Throughout the process I was given miss leading information.  Now I am afraid I am going to miss out on a second draw. My advice pick somewhere else. If you are already with Lendio do not call them after you are placed with a lender. Call the lender direct. Very frustrating process all around and probably cost me big time.",4
everything is nice,"Lendio is very professional organization and not too pushy with their other services, but they do make known what they can offer.",5
"You guys cap at 100,000 gross so you do…",Very positive experience securing PPP loan through Lendio!  Submitted the app and that was that. Process was smooth and successful!,4
Thank you,"I had the opportunity of speaking with Michelle Wright in regards to submitting documents for the PPP loan. She was very helpful in assisting, ex[plaining and checking to see if all documents were submitted correctly. Michelle Wright is a great asset to your company and she should be rewarded for her hard work.",5
Lendio are the best,"Been trying to get somebody on the phone to figure out the status of my application.  I had initially canceled it almost a month ago, but it went through anyway. Now I have no access to the online portal, not does anyone answer the phone.  And since my application was approved with the SBA I can't start over again with my bank.Update(3/17/2021): I have finally talked to two people (a week ago) Matt and Dominic.  My application was in manual review, which should have only lasted a ""couple"" days.  It has been over a week now.  I have called repeatedly, as well as found the number for my ""local rep"".  No surprise, but calling that phone number (and the other three for Texas) gets me nowhere. no answer, no way to leave a message (I doubt it would be returned anyway).According to the SBA website, my loan has been funded, but waiting for the money to be disbursed.How do you expect to run a business if nobody answers the phone, returns emails, or replies to text messages.  Oh, and I can't login to my account online, supposedly its a known issue that was reported a week ago to their IT team.",5
The one and only best lender Lendio and…,"Lendio was there to guide me through each step.  The application seemed almost effortless.  Thank you for excellent service, support, and follow up.",5
Excellent Service,Lendio did exactly what they said they would help us do. We got our PPP  loan and they were there all the way through the process telling us what to do and what to submit. Communication was excellent with easy support for any questions along the way. We are very happy with our experience. Thank You!Allen and Sharon Dubner,5
EXCELLENT,"Lendio you are the bomb! These guys were super helpful, and determined to help those who have applied for the  PPP to receive their funds. They make sure that all paperwork is in order to submit to the SBA. They work tirelessly to assure that your application is complete, all to help you to receive your loan! Nothing but good things to say about Lendio!",5
Great Automation,I was having trouble logging into and setting up my account. I called the help line number and got Laura Burnham. She was very patient and knowledgeable and helped me get everything started. She was very professional and amazing at keeping me calm.,5
Their services was fast easy and helpful,I found entire process with Lendio very easy.  I was kept informed was was able to communicate directly with some of the processors.  I definitely recommend them.,5
Great company to work with,"I can't say enough great things about Lendio. I was applying for PPP #2 funding with a big bank. After weeks of uploading docs to their online portal, I got nowhere. Out of frustration, I applied to Lendio. The same day a real live person emailed me back! The team helped me navigate the process and get the correct documents. The loan was funded within in 2 weeks or so. I can't say enough good things!",5
Excellent customer service.,"Thank you for easy application! BlueVine was the company I used last time. This time they chose to sit on my application. Lendio was able to find me Legacy Bank and once DocSign was completed, loan was funded in 3 business days!",5
Horrible experience - Loan funded 42 days after approval - Many mistakes and no communication,"Applied for a 2nd round PPP loan on the 1st day of applications for minority business owners in January.  It's now March and other than requesting the same information over again a couple of times, I have gotten zero follow up or feedback.  My loan officer has changed at least 3 times and not one of them has returned an email.  Even when responding directly to an email they have sent me with a question, I haven't gotten a bit of follow up.  Very frustrating when our small business has been so impacted by Covid, knowing the money is there for minority business owners but we may miss out because of the amount of time it is taking these folks to process our application.",1
I has been a wonderful experience doing…,"They’re completely disorganized. The persons who handle your cases change every single day almost. No one seems to be able to reply to any of my questions. No matter if I contact them by replying to the emails I send them or through their website, no one ever gets in touch with me to try to solve my problem. And yet they have the courage to send me an email (5 minutes ago) asking for a 5 star review. :-D what a joke. To get a 5 star review you must first provide a decent service.",5
Great overall,Lendio just made it easy. Plain and simple,4
Fast quick easy site was up to date…,Thank you so much,5

Straight forward process,Great experience. Speedy concise communication and quick funding. I would highly recommend this organization.,5
Working with Lendio was quick and easy,Lendio you are the best company ever!!!Good job guys!!!!Outstanding!!!,5
TERRIBLE SERVICE  LENDIO BACK ON March 24th…,The process started off fast and good. I applied through Titanbank but I guess their lender is lendio. Lendio doesn’t respond. I’ve emailed and called over and over. To have no progress on my application. I hate bashing a company but I had high hopes in this loan process from what I have read in reviews. I don’t recommend them for any business in need of immediate funds.,1
What a helpful team!,"We just got our 2nd draw of PPP loan thru Lendio. The application was fast and easy to follow and Lendio kept updated us on the status of our loan. Very good service, thank you Lendio team.",5
They made the process simple,Great all around service and follow-up throughout the process!,5
Helpful Guidance,"We used (censored) bank for the first PPP and they were great to work with. Got the money out fast too. Lendio has very poor communication. It took a long time to finally reach someone. Phone, email and chat are all hit and miss. I applied for PPP in January and still am waiting on the financial aid. It would be nice to know if ones loan is still active or if they need more information.EDIT 3-10-21I signed the loan documents yesterday.  I seems like my review got the ball rolling.  When I receive the funds I will update the reviewEDIT 3-23-21Received the funding.  Lendio has reached out to me a few times since. Please work on your customer communication guys.  Albeit not in a timely fashion, they got the job done.  3 Stars",5
Respond quickly,Lendio has excellent customer service. My loan officer kept me updated throughout the process. The process was fast and will help me keep my business going. I highly recommend their service.,5

Everyone worked fast to ensure the…,I was approved. The communication wasn't the greatest but they got me approved by a lender for the 1st draw of PPP in 4- 6 weeks.,5
I do want to thank Lendio for their…,The service was very effective and efficient.,5
Easy to navigate online,"I am grateful in the end our PPP was approved. However, I would not go through Lendio again based on my experience. I had five or more Account Managers over the application process. None of them were responsive and returned calls/messages. At one point I received a call after signing the contract the loan amount had been reduced. I questioned this as it didn't seem right. Still, I have never heard back from my Account Manager. I ended up digging up the actual lender's number and calling them to get the matter resolved and funds in my account. The lender had nothing down about my loan being reduced from the contracted amount and was unsure why Lendio stated that as the hold-up. In the end, I did get funding, with a lot of frustration and extra diligence on my end.",3
All of the people at Lendio were…,Overall quick and effective. Almost took one star off as they needed more information from me for two weeks but there was no status indicating that and didn't find out until after I e-mailed them. Once I gave them the missing info everything was processed very quickly so decided to keep them at 5 stars since they did move quickly once they got the missing info.,5
Lendio is awesome!,Dominique McKinney was very helpful and pleasant.,5
Every Funding Manager was responsive…,Well I have no complaints. Money came through when it was needed most. Grateful to the help. Was always responded in a timely fashion,5
The best way to get the PPP...,I called you many times but no one answered. Then I sent an email to ask the same question no one replied. But very fast loan which makes it up.,5
Total thumbs up!!,"I applied for a PPP loan through Lendio and it was the fastest, easiest loan I have ever applied for and funds were received within a week.",5
On time clear communication and follow…,"I cannot explain in enough detail just how ridiculous Lendio has been. We have been trying to process a PPP loan for months now, to no avail. When Lendio's associates reach out, it must be a farce because they don't actually respond to you when you try to communicate back with them.We successfully received a round one PPP loan through a different vendor, BlueVine, previously, but made the mistake of trying Lendio for round two. Boy, I wish we hadn't. The last email called for us to ""upload all the documents we need asap"" - without explaining what documents they could possibly be referring to. Which is a joke in itself, because we uploaded all necessary documents and more in January. Worse yet, because Lendio apparently got us an SBA loan # and funds ""assigned"" to us, we can't apply for a PPP loan through anyone else while Lendio drags their heels in perpetuity.When you try to call, the phone either is busy, won't connect, or you go to a voicemail that doesn't call you back. Ever. We've had 4 or 5 different ""Funding Managers"" with Lendio, all with the same result. Consumers beware, we have been trying to work with Lendio for two months and still do not have any PPP funds.Edit 3.17.2021: The madness continues.After my review Lendio reached out, as you can see below. I received an apology for the lack of communication and was assured that no further documents were needed, that somehow the email sent asking for unspecified documents was auto-generated. Given the typos, I find that hard to believe but it gets much, much worse.I then asked the Funding Manager for an ETA or timeline. Back to silence.So I took to the virtual chat about a week later. It was revealed to me that there was an offer and money was waiting, Lendio just needed to push it through. Days passed without anything.I then received another email asking for documents that we, an limited liability partnership (LLP), just don't have. It was actually two emails: one asking for our non-existent business license and the other asking for tax forms like Form 944 that we don't have since we don't have any W-2 employees (just the two partners who obviously just use Schedule K-1 and pass through).What's more concerning than the actual document requests is what appears to be happening - we're caught in a perpetual time loop. Lendio already asked for these same documents six weeks ago. At that time, I explained the above and why they didn't exist for our type of business.Worse yet, money is apparently reserved with a lender waiting. Yet here we are, back at square 1.5, repeating myself to Lendio about non-existent documents. Honestly, this whole thing has just been miserable and this conduct is just reckless and unacceptable.Edit 3.23.2021Watched a YouTube presentation with Lendio's CEO, Brock Blake, on ""How to Keep Your [PPP] Application Moving Forward"" and could not help but notice he confirmed what I have been telling Lendio's representatives all along - that the Secretary of State Registration is sufficient proof to validate a business (i.e. fraud is running rampant so often lenders are asking for additional documentation to stop the fraudsters). We have provided that very document to Lendio at least three (3) seperate times. Rather than push our applicaiton through they keep asking for documentation that we do not have, or they ignore us instead. Something is amiss over at Lendio.Edit 4.5.2021 - Lendio attempted to take down this review, shameful. I provided documentation to Trustpilot and it has now been verified. For anyone wondering, at the end of March and since funding still did not occur, apparently the lender cancelled our application with Lendio. All that work, all that duplicate effort, all that time, for nothing.Lendio offered to resubmit the application to a different lender, but fool me once...To date, we have not received confirmation Lendio has released our number for the SBA. That means even if we apply someplace else, if that has not occurred, the SBA will still think we have an application through Lendio and it will get denied as a duplicate. Let our experience be a warning - do yourself a favor and use anyone besides Lendio for a PPP application if you're a small business like us.",5
Lendio helped us out very good,I really appreciate their assistance. Excellent service!,5
Lendio was great,"Everything went will until I received the docusign email. It closed before I could sign completely.  I call for 3 weeks to get it corrected.  Every other day, I was assigned to another funding manager who told me there was nothing they could do.  I finally called the customer service number, who escalated it and finally I received a new email.  This was very frustrating.",5
This company has done a very good job…,"Lendio was fast, easy to use and responsive when I had a question. Only took off one star because of a missed deadline on my original application. Ultimately they got the job done.",5
Friendly helpful am happy,All of my documents were in jpeg and they needed to be in PDF.  It would be nice if that were stated on the download page so I would not have had to redo all of the documents,5
PPP loan,"Lendio is a super company to work with. They are there to answer all you questions. They are knowledgeable and so helpful . I have recommended them to friends. It is so nice working with a company that is not only professional, friendly and understanding.",5
"Lendio - no communication, no replies, too stressful to use","The only reason I gave two stars is because I finally got my $.  I had at least 4 people reach out after applying saying ""they will contact me shortly"", and never got anything.  I got daily emails from Lendio saying ""time was running out"" and feared all $ would be gone by the time one of you dinks actually replied.  I finally applied elsewhere, only to get rejected because you incompetent clowns already forwarded my app to SBA without saying a GD thing!!  I left a vm and sent an email to you threatening litigation, and low and behold, I had my money 2 days later.  And STILL have not heard a damn thing from one your people.  For future needs I will definitely NOT be using Lendio!  Blue Vine customer service is LIGHTYEARS ahead of you!!!!",1

Lendio was great it took a minute but…,They were great getting me my PPP loan! There was an actual real person I could speak to and very attentive and on top of everything for me. Made the process really smooth and painless. Thank you Lendio!!,5
I never heard about my funding.,The loan has been approved through Lendio but needs improvement in the overall communication.  The system is good but no proper communication between the customer support team and every week different person is assigned and no phone call is returned . Needs improvement in the overall communication.,1
Business owner,"I applied for PPP loan twice with Lendio - both times ran into technical processing problems with paperwork.  Issue is there is nobody to contact to help fix the problems, you're left out on your own.  I tried contact via email with no luck - no responses.  There is no phone # to call.  Too bad as it is a easy to use platform but customer service was non-existent, in my experience, at least.  First time I eventually got my loan (eventually), second time I didn't so I jumped to another lender which processed/completed PPP loan in less than 2 weeks.",5

Banking services,I would recommend Lendio to anyone who’s small business crashed because of the Pandemic. Fast turn around and was very helpful throughout the process!,5
Love Lendio!!,3/10. This is a updated post. I finally received my funds. 16 days after signing the promissory note. Communication was very lack. Funding managers shifted several times. This process was very long and exhausting because of the lack of communication. I just don’t understand how Lendio doesn’t have a direct contact to all the Lenders. I’m updating to two stars because I finally received funds. Shouts to Landon I talked with u two days ago and now I finally have my funds. I initially begin this process January around the 15th. I signed my promissory note on 2/22. Here we are going into the 2nd week of March and I have yet to receieve my funds. I’ve had countless funding managers(who never answer the phone or respond to emails) this whole process sucks and I would not recommend using lendio. If I could give a negative star I would. They don’t even deserve 1 star!!! And I feel like all these positive post are fake and made by lendio,5

Our position was unique and complicated, but the folks at Lendio helped out to how to get the right paperwork to the right people to get the loan approved. Due partially to the PPP funding that we were able to get, our small business will probably make it out this mess OK, and continue to grow.",1

However, I did receive my funds and my business and family would be in big trouble if it weren’t for Lendio right now. So, if you are waiting like I was, don’t lose hope. It will come.",4

If you guys want to be taken care of the right way then choose Lendio, hopefully, you will be as happy as I am with the service you receive!",5
Quick easy introduction and very helpful,"Huge disappointment.Terrible communication and customer service.  No one ever returned phone calls or emails.  The chat on line was completely useless.  The web page with updates was inaccurate and showed a different fund manager every 1-3 days. A completely different experience than what we had with the first PPP with Amex.  I would not use this company again if I have a choice.  We were told by Amex to use Lendio.  I did let my Amex rep know of the poor quality of service we received, after which our loan went thru the very next day.",5

Knowledgeable Professional,I applied for pp and it was 2 months with not much contact,5
Just to let you know that I am very…,"I applied for a Second Draw Paycheck Protection Loan to sustain my woman-owned small business. I had never heard of Lendio prior to this, but followed a series of links within an article The Hartford (an insurance provider I trust) had sent me. I was delighted to find a very easy, yet comprehensive, online application.My application was completed in mid-January, with three potential lenders (including the entity that supplied my initial loan, which had been fully forgiven). Lendio was not only the first to finish processing all my paperwork, they were the only one to give me a call (yes, a REAL person talked with me! she even complimented my customized business logo!). I also received numerous emails, from an array of associates on their customer experience team; I always knew exactly where we were in the process (including what was needed next). The closing process was very straightforward. By mid-February (a month later), I was sharing my direct deposit information. By late February, funds were in my account (roughly six weeks later, start-to-finish). Lendio not only made me feel supported but proved to be incredibly reliable. I feel they tune into the financial situations of those in need and treat them with utmost respect, lightening our loads with much-needed resources we may not be able to tap on our own. In my case, for instance, the bank that processed my loan was also ""new"" to me (just as Lendio had been). Since my business is tiny, I have difficulty finding banks willing to process such small loans. I cannot speak highly enough of Lendio––from the ease of using their online portal, to the integrity of those who connect people to resources, and the follow-up resources they provide––it is evident they truly care.",5

PPP funding,Excellent support!,5
overall great experience,In general Lendio was quick and kept me up to date. The problem I had was that their advisers would notify me that docu sign was lacking data and when I checked all data had been uploaded. Calling the adviser was a joke as she never responded to me. At the very end Lendio sent me an email asking me to download a copy of my bank check and bank info which also had been  previously submitted. It appears that the assistants/advisors do not notify anyone which is a constant irritation.Marvin Ginsburg MD,4

Trustworthy,"AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE. I applied for a second draw PPP loan through Lendio. I received a loan number, but after that, NOTHING. I have called and left messages 3 times and emailed 4 times, but no replies. It is INCREDIBLY frustrating.UPDATE, March 25th 2021:I STILL cannot get through to anyone at Lendio. No returned calls, and my emails go unanswered. 3 days ago, I received an email stating ""Your PPP loan specialist has reached out and has not heard back."" This is not true, nobody has reached out to me. I replied to the email, and was directed to call an 800 number, which turned out to be a pre-recorded telemarketer selling me on everything from lowering my Medicare costs to a new cellphone plan. I don't know what Lendio is up to but clearly they do not care about me at all as customer. I will be reporting Lendio to the Inspector General of the SBA. If Lendio cared as much about responding to my communications as they cared about responding to my negative review, this would not be an issue.",5

Its been 32 days by my count. Just WOW.",5

absolutely fantastic,"I'd actually give 4 1/2 STARS -- We received an email which invited us to apply for a second draw PPP loan.  The links were available and easy to navigate.  Once we started the application process we were politely and consistently nudged (via email) when we had not completed the application.  Ultimately Lendio answered helped us complete the application in a very efficient and polite manner.The only reason for a 1/2 STAR deduction had to do with lack of direct response from email we sent to our contact, asking specific questions. A little frustrating, but again, with a nudge the next day about what was missing from the application we were able to complete the process successfully.",5

Got it done quickly,"Initially everything went smooth. Although I did send a copy of a voided check to get the lender the correct business bank account, when I received the loan documents via esig the account number had the last 2 digits left off. The lender caught it and asked for clarification. I responded and resent the voided check. No confirmation it was ever corrected and its been weeks and very difficult and time consuming to get ahold of anyone. My guess is they do great unless there is a problem then you are lost in a maze of online and automated processes. I did get a person via chat yesterday that seemed to help and was going to follow up. Nothing after 24 hours. Hopefully I am not lost in another maze.3/19/2021 update. Contract was resent and resigned Monday March 15th  and we are waiting for funding. In fairness they did originally say it could take up to 10 days fo fund the loan.  (Loan was originally approved 2/23/2021)4/12/2021 New documents were sent (my 3rd set) and signed 3/29/2021 still no funding. I did reach out to the actual lender and they won't help either. They say the problem is on Lendio's side. What a mess - Don't risk it go somewhere else.",5

it was helpful.,"I used Lendio for both rounds of the PPP & I was incredibly impressed with their services. They made the process and forms simple to understand and easy to upload. Not to mention their customer chat support was SO HELPFUL. If I was stuck on a portion of the application, someone would very quickly answer my question & talk me through it. I couldn't recommend them more!",5
Lendio helped us get our PPP loan when…,Everything went super smooth. The process was easy and quick.,5
I liked the system for submitting…,The process was quick and easy! I tried going through Bank of America at first and that was a terrible experience!,3
I got this email saying rate Lendio but…,Everything was good except the applying process having to go in multiple times to put information that either I already put or it didn't ask for in the first place was a bit frustrating. Besides that it was great.,1
They have great customer service & will…,I loved Lendio !  Very easy to work with and they kept me update on my loan process.I would definitely recommend them to everyone!,5
Unhappy customer,"The only issue I had and I believe it was because you were understaffed, is that our loan managers kept changing. None of my calls or e mails were even acknowledged until Marianne McCreight came on board. She answered immediately, stayed on top of the situation and guided us accordingly. 5 Stars!!!",1
The team I worked with Fast and Professional.,Excellent customer service. I was guided easily through the process.,5

Also, I kept getting different people ""assigned"" to my account.  Bottom line, once that was all cleared up it was smooth sailing and I got my 2nd loan!  Thank you!",5

They were very good at follow up and…,Great quick easy,5
The money was deposited into my account…,"MY FUNDS WERE NOT SENT ON MONDAY MARCH 8th!!!! LENDIO IS STILL LYING!!!!Was funded 1/2 my PPP loan. Have been working with Lendio for over 2 weeks, getting the run around from every single employee. Nothing like signing a promissory note and getting 1/2 of the amount. Lendio reps told me 'tough luck, call the bank, we did our part'. Can you believe that? if it isn't resolved within a few more days I am definitely taking my case to an attorney",5
Yes Lendio is the trust worthy company…,Easy to work with and got us the loan we needed. Would highly recommend!,5
Ledio Team is so awesome,"amazing, they always respond to emails and were great help even texted me if I needed help. I will be using them in the future for sure!",5
very helpful and knowledgeable,"I started this process with the 2nd PPP and it is has been hell with this company.  You can not speak to anyone and they do not respond to emails.  I appears they did good doing the first PPP but this 2nd round they are lost.  I would not recommend this company for any kind of loan.  I started this back on 02/19/2021 I have been in the lending status for 2 and half weeks and every week they change funding managers on you I have had 3 doing this time.  I have requested to withdraw my application and can not get a response.  On there site there is a link that allow you to withdraw your application but it goes no where it ask you to call 855-853-6346 and when you call it tells you that they are too busy to answer the call to try and email someone.  So I requested by email and still no answer from anyone.  DO NOT WASTE YOU TIME with LENDIO. BAD, BAD, BAD choice.Update: WOW, Today for the first time I got someone to respond stating that they tried calling me.  My phone is right here and I have not received a call from Lendio.  It told me to write a bad review to get someone from this company to reach out to me.  What a jokeUpdate: 03/08/2021 Today I checked to see if I received an email from Lendio and there was non.  However, when I checked my PPP on Lendio website they have locked me out and cancelled my PPP application without notice that was being done.  PLEASE everyone do not use Lendio they made this process very hard and that is not what we are looking for when hard times hit you.  We what a company that understand and will do everything they can to help.  All they have done is create headaches and stress to the process and very poor communication if you can get an answer out of anyone at all.Update 03/24/21 - Today I was able to access my account on Lendio after being blocked for a week and now this is how that have me account.:I applied for this loan back on 02/19/2021 today on 03/24/21 I went to Lendio portal and this is what they had Paycheck Protection Program OffersYOUR APPLICATIONSSecond DrawLOAN OFFERSAdd DocumentsEdit ApplicationDownload ApplicationSuccess!

got it right away,Worse company ever. I’ve been going back and forth with these people for a month. I finally signed my loan documents Feb 22nd. Today is March 5th and I still have not received my funds. My advice would be to skip the middle man and deal directly with the lenders. They give you the run around snd they’ve switched my account managers 6 times since I started this process.,5
REALY FAST SERVICE AND GREAT HELP AS…,Very easy and fast turnaround from start to finish.,5
Excellent service and fast processing.,My experience was everything. I was missing a document they reached out within an hour after completing my app. Always receive updates and they are there for any questions or any concerns overall Excellent experience,5

Poor Communication,"I was nervous to start an application for my ppp and in fact I even started my application here and with a competitive brand, I was pleasantly surprised by Lendio’s customer service. Everyone I’ve spoken to was patient and responded in a timely manner . ( by the time the other company reached out to me for more documents, Lendio already funded my account",1
The best,Very user friendly group that goes out of their way to help you,5
Thank you so much for helping us,My experience with Lendio was very positive.  It was a easy process to apply on line.  My loan was processed in a timely manner.  I found the chat feature of the online application very helpful when I had questions,5
Straight forward program  easy system…,online intake of the application and quick communication if anything was wrong with the application.MB.,5
Working with Lendio for my business ppp…,"I applied for a second draw PPP loan with Lendio.  I did not use them the first round, but had heard good things about the company.  There were several webinars that Lendio offered about the new PPP application process that I watched.  I was also assigned a lender that followed up with me.  I was glad that there was a customer service number for me to use when I had questions that was always answered by a live person.  I received the loan funds quickly and was impressed with the smooth process.",5
Great process,Great service but the only problem I faced was calls were not attended and not replied to as wellI can understand they might be busy...5-star cause they have excellent and quick service.,5
Thank you for handling this,The entire team from underwriting  to securing the loan has been extremely helpful and hands on for the whole process. This has been the smoothest experience I've ever had.,5
This process took 2 months,Very helpful group,1
Lendio exceptional service,I would like to say that the people at lendio were less then helpful through this process lendio will not let me be fully honest and post who caused less then assistance during my process they are a disgrace in the process. I would say if I had to do this again with the multiple incompatence on lendios part I would pick another lender I will say if it wasnt for Jarrett and another young lady to correct there issues I might of gone else where. Lendio you need to retrain your management very very poor results.,5
Quick response and professional service.,"Very fast and efficient,  deal went smoothly",5
Very attentive and diligent.,"The entire loan process was fast and easy. I submitted all my documents online, and whenever I had questions there was always someone to answer my questions on the online chat. I highly recommend Lendio.",5

Fast and Successful Application,Lendio was very helpful with facilitating PPP loan. I am very appreciative,5
Amazing,Thank you for all you have done for me....,5
Great customer service,"This is the worst company. No one is ever picking up the calls or responding to voice or emails. I applied for PPP loan thru them. Not only they rejected my application and didn’t let me know but their shady lender Customer Bank has secured SBA number for this loan. As a result I cannot apply through another lender even though my business definitely qualifies for a loan. Do not deal with them!UpdateOnly After writing my initial review someone immediately tried to reach out as stated in their response.They promised to connect next day, still waiting. Worst customer service!",5
Lendio was Perfect!,"The Lendio team got it done, but it was not a totally smooth experience. I had to be very diligent about following changes to the application process (i.e. evolving documentation requirements), and check frequently to catch when then application had stalled.  Had several personnel changes during process.  But I was usually able to get messages to officers via e-mail or via the online chat function (which was great when it worked).  Sometimes I got answers and sometimes I had to call back again.  I’d say all in all I’m happy because my loan got done in the end, during a time when there was a lot of confusion in general because the government kept moving the goal posts. This was expected.  I just didn’t like the feeling of never knowing what was going in until the process was actually done.",5
I can report only positives about my…,"I was a little skeptical to apply, but as soon as I did they responded and assisted with the entire process. Everything went very smoothly!",5
Great people to work with,Lendio has done a great job putting together a small loan for my business. They kept me informed through the process. I would recommend Lendio to anyone that needed a loan. Thank you!,5
Great service,"The process of applying was simple but too cumbersome in terms of requirements for people who are not technologically savvy. People were very helpful to ease the application but after the requirements have been satisfied the absence of communication is daunting. After Docusign and receipt of signed documents, after acknowledgement no further communication except finding the funds in my account but no notification of the funding. I guess the bottom line would be and saving grace is it was approved and funded in an acceptable timeframe. The lack of communication would be the very reason why I did not rate it as 5 stars.",5
Thanks Lendio for all your help now I…,Kind and efficient.  A breath of fresh air during this stressful time.  A pleasure to work with.,5
Quick and easy,Obtaining a PPP loan thru Lendio was very easy and it was really nice to have the option to email or physically speak to someone vs the other big banks (I wont name but they have the initials WF) that have no offering of speaking to anyone what so ever.  I would most definitely use Lendio again!!,5
Great customer service,"I submitted my PPP loan only a few days before the August 8th deadline not realizing I had to submit it through a third-party who had to then submit it to a lender.  After submitting my application back in August they immediately called me & told me they would do what they could but that it might not get picked up in time before the August 8th deadline which I appreciated their candor.  As soon as the PPP program was extended, they reached out to me wanting me to go into my online account to update anything I needed to update & then were in constant contact with me until I finally did get my PPP loan approved & disbursed which I greatly appreciated.  I also appreciated that they did not try to spam me with a ton of other emails when I missed the first deadline trying to get me to apply for a different loan for my business when none of those loans are the same as getting a potentially forgivable PPP loan.  They were helpful & didn't judge me which is important to me when I'm just a sole proprietor trying to work my way through all of these rules during a very difficult time (with the help of my wife).",5
The process for applying for a PPP loan…,"Lendio is easy, fast, & secured company. I uploaded all the docs needed. The funds was directly deposited in my checking account in just 2 days.  Thanks to you all. God Bless!!!",5

They were good people too work with,"Have had 10 different funding managers for 2nd Draw PPP loan. Sole Proprietor, 2nd draw. First draw was Fundbox (excellent experience but they aren't doing 2nd draw)Applied 1/26Loan submitted to SBA 2/7Signed Loan Docs for Benworth Cap 2/18Still nothing, lender says app is stuck in Lendio's portal and they can't do anything about it.Can not get ahold of anyone @ Lendio, cannot apply anywhere else because they're holding my loan hostage as Active, undisbursed with the SBA. Calls go nowhere - emails ignored - website chats unanswered.Update: Total waste of over a month. Lender Benworth Capital does not go by SBA guidelines, should not be allowed to originate PPP loans. Terrible experience through and through, having the middleman Lendio did more harm than good during an already slow process, and stole over a month of my time by failing to respond and reassigning Lending Managers.",5
Bad experience,Horrible experience. First draw PPP. Taysha hicks is my funding manager. No contact what so ever. My loan is locked in and there is nothing I can do about it being that if I withdraw it the etran number would be in que past the expiration date of the ppp program. I recommend nobody use this service for their needs. Not even loans.,1

Thanks you Lendio,Easy application process and generally good follow up. Overall very good experience,5
"No regrets, total approval!",Fantastic Service! I have directed every other business owner in need of assistance to them because they are by far the best company for business lending.,5
Well Done,No one gets back to you.  I’ve left several voicemails with various “dedicated”account reps as well as emails.  I know they’re  swamped but PPP applications are up against a deadline and if I can’t get a response then I’m just spinning my wheels with Lendio.  It’s frustrating.,5
Lendio is great,You made this round of PPP funding so easy.Thank you,5

Lendio's website is user friendly and…,"PPP is very confusing.  After being denied from the website app, Lendio gave me a person to help me with what I did qualify for.  They directed me on what information I needed. Lendio sent email updates till I recieved the money in less that a week after being approved.  Very happy with their professional service. Thanks Lendio, I will recommend you to others.",5
My best experience.,"The first round of PPP I applied for through Lendio it was not processed in time and I did not get it.  The second round since they had all my info I was pleased to receive through Lendio although it seemed at times they asked over and over again for documents I had already uploaded to portal, they would say they got it and then the system kept emailing wanting the same docs over and over although I would get confirmation of receipt time and time again.  Then the reps text you but then will ignore texts to them and if you call it goes straight to voicemail.  Half the time the rep sounded like he was smoking pot or was very tired at home working and not quite coherent.  Otherwise I got the money in the end.  So that was good.",5
It's fine,"We received excellent service.  The website was very user friendly, had very responsive representatives, it was very easy to navigate, and we always received timely, accurate information.  I would highly recommend Lendio to others. It was an great experience for our company.",3
Smooth and fast.,"READ TO BOTTOM FOR UPDATE.Old: I was approved through Lendio three and a half weeks ago. At that point in time, my funding manager told me to expect an approval within a couple days with an email confirming it. Since that time, I have not received any emails. My funding manager has responded to none of my calls. None of my texts. None of my emails. Keep in mind, I am doing this every day. It was about a week ago when I made the decision to apply through he PPP program with PNC (whom I do my business banking with). Within three days, they had me approved on their side and two days later, today, I received a call that the SBA bounced back my application because I already have an SBA registration number. They did not specify who it was from but obviously from Lendio. I am at a loss at this point because no matter how many times I reach out to Lendio- I cannot get a response from anyone. I do not know if I should withdrawal my application on Lendio portal so that PNC can retry it, but I am scared with the lack of professionalism at Lendio how long it would even take them to process the withdrawal of my application. Can anyone please help me either get into contact with Lendio or advice as to what to with this situation?I got my first PPP with Lendio and it has been a polar opposite from the first.^^This was my review before connecting with BILL AIRY of Lendio Denver. Bill has NOT stopped working with us to get our application approved. If I was going to War, I would want Bill Airy standing next to me. He has shared his experiences as a business owner and is able to be sympathetic and understanding, as well as incredibly knowledgable. Bill really has it figured out and has been more than a delight to talk to this morning. From Chicago, IL to Denver, CO - sending Bill our appreciation!",5
Good Experience,My experience with Lendio was fast and easy.,5
That was fast and easy!,I was very surprised at how quick the loan was approved and how fast the money was made available.  Thank you Lendio.,5
Lendio Five Stars,"Lendio helped me process my PPP loan. Service was fast, professional and customer friendly. I would recommend them to my friends and family. This is how much I liked working with them. I would definitely consider them for my business needs as well in the future.  Great job!",5
Smooth process,"Thanks for all your hard work on our behalf.  I appreciated that your process was smooth and worked very well for us.  Thanks,",5
I tried a few lenders,I got a loan number from SBA on Feb 22 and today is March 4 no loan documents to sign. I spoke with a representative at SBA. They told me when they give a loan number that means they sent that amount of funds to a lender. So... the money is sitting there. I'm canceling this application today. These other good reviews cannot be real for this company.*Update I heard back from Lendio and they processed my application*,5
Easy matching with ready capital,LENDIO WAS USER FRIENDLY EFFICIENT FAST.  MY EXPERIENCE AS A WHOLE WAS TOP NOTCH AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE I KNOW.,5
I applied for a ppp loan over two…,"Update:This morning Ready Capital contacted me and asked me to sign ANOTHER loan document - this is the third one! Dated today. With a threat that if I don't quickly sign that I will have to start over. See my review of Ready Capital.Note that on the Ready Capital loan document the loan amount is ""$a1j4O00000EHFWHQA5""STAY AWAYUpdate:Lendio contacted me within minutes of posting a review. So, for all of you that can't get in touch with them about your PPP loan, post a 1 star review.He told me that Lendio sent me another docusign on 2/26 which I had signed. This is the second one - Ready Capital sent one on 2/2. He assured me that the loan would be disbursed soon since we signed the second form on 2/26. It is now day 11. The is the second time that they have not disbursed the funds within 10 days. I've tried applying with other lenders but the application is rejected because we are locked into Lendio. STAY AWAY FROM LENDIO. They are completely overwhelmed. I've had 3-4 ""relationship managers"" in this process and not a single one responds to any contact. --- Ready Capital approved PPP and sent to Lendio on Feb 4th when they got the SBA Loan number which locks me in to Lendio. It is now a MONTH later and Lendio still has not disbursed funds. They were supposed to disburse funds within 10 days. I call Lendio and they say they're still working to find a lender. All the while I'm locked out of other lenders. I've had 3 different Lendio reps and no one knows what the heck is going on. Absolutely horrible experience. They are in violation of the SBA rules of disbursing within 10 days.",2
Very bad communication,Thank you for all you help during these trying times!,3
Excellent and professional service,"1. I was passed around to 3 different Lendio representatives during my application process. It would have been less stressful if I only had to deal with one agent.2. The Federal Gov't kept changing the goalposts (of what forms of proof of business legitimacy was required). I'm not blaming Lendio for this, but I was tempted to throw in the towel and refuse the loan at some point.",5

NO ONE.  I called my ""contact"" and left several messages.  I texted the number she instructed me to use, and nothing.  I've emailed 3 times and nothing.

Good service,"Lendio was a bad experience. Locked me in on their process, told me I’d have to wait weeks to withdraw (so I couldn’t go to another lender) told me to change the amount of loan I requested, then approved me for a different amount (different than what I requested and what they told me to change to) without asking me if that was OK, and then none of their reps would return my calls or emails.",5

The first PPP done by Lendio was…,I submitted all paperwork on January 18th and received an immediate text/call and email form a representative. At that time I emailed over the remaining requested info and a call was set up for Jan 22nd to go over everything and get us squared away. I was stood up for that call and emailed with no response. I had 5 different reps assigned to our file and emailed or called each as I saw their names with no response. The chat function told me reps were dealing with 150 apps a day but after 3 weeks I don't know how there were thousands of applications in before ours when it was submitted on the first day. I kept getting emails saying everything was entered and then would get an email saying some document was missing. On Feb 20th I was walked thru the application again when I went to ensure the docs were all there and it resubmitted the application like it was new. I then finally got a good rep who followed thru and followed up by phone and had to email supporting info and tax docs in for a 3rd time. We finally got our funds last week after a 6 week process and needing to follow up dozens of times with no response. We went with Lendio as opposed to a big bank for the 2nd draw due to forgiveness being denied repeatedly at Chase though all paperwork was official. Chase has just begun accepting 2020 forgiveness this week. We wanted to avoid the run around with Chase but got a bigger one with Lendio,2

Thank God for Lendio,My experience with Lendio and Bluevine was worth the effort. It was as easy as the the first time. The only suggestion I could make would be to increase phone access.

VERY HAPPY WITH THE PROCESS,"My company was linked up to Lendio through Womply, which in turn I was linked up to through a local tourism organization. They processed my second round PPP loan and matched me with a lender successfully. Uploading my application was easy and the automated process made sure I got all the necessary details into the application so that it would be accepted.My one small issue is that I had trouble getting a ""false start"" application for a 1st round PPP loan deleted. It didn't interfere with my 2nd round loan, but I kept getting automated email prompts that were very distracting and their customer service team couldn't see the problem. But it wasn't a big deal.Cheers-Eric",5

The representative that I worked with was very responsive and even proactive (she checked in with me via text and voicemail when I did not immediately upload some of the documents).  Once all of my documentation was in order, everything proceeded smoothly and it took about 10 business days for my loan to be approved and another 2 days for funds to be disbursed.

Chat service is even down.",5
The site was ok,"Absolutely terrible experience. Non-communicative, non-knowledgeable, email conversation drop off spontaneously. There is no sense of care, despite the fact that people's businesses and livelihood are on the line here.",3
Great job,"I went through the lengthy process and finally received the approval and executed the PPP agreement - took about 3 weeks. My funding manager changed 4 times during the process.  The process was actually not too difficult, however, the communication was complicated each time the funding managers changed but I did receive funding 12 days after I signed the agreement. They can improve in certain aspects but overall I would recommend Lendio for PPP.",5
3 stars is generous,"Applied for a PPP second draw about a month ago. They processed the application, submitted it to a lender (Benworth), and there has been no movement. The funds are reserved at the SBA since the first week of Feb, so I can't apply elsewhere, and I can't get in contact with anyone at Lendio or Benworth (their phone mailbox is full and if you call it will hang up on you) to cancel the approval with the SBA. I requested to withdraw my application, but have heard nothing. Stuck and can't apply anywhere else. Avoid at all costs.",3
Quick and efficient handling of my PPP…,"I applied for our PPP on 2/3 with Lendio...was asked several times for the same documentation over and over again, had 2 different representatives reach out to me about my application. Finally on 2/12 we received word that we had passed the processing stage and had been issued our SBA # and would be receiving our funds soon. It is now 3/2 and our funding manager changes everyday...each time I email one to check on the status of our funding a new funding manager shows up on our account. I reached out to the SBA and they stated we should of received our funds by now - I can't get anyone to respond, and this is getting old really quick!!! If you weren't an honest company why did you take this on???? What do I need to do to get my PPP funds ASAP. Cancel my app, reapply elsewhere....HELP!!!!!!",5
Lendio is the best platform to get a…,Wendy with Lendio Kansas City! Was super helpful! Helped us find and track down the funds! Thanks Wendy,5
Lendio was very helpful and diligent to…,No follow through with emails. Can’t get a hold of anyone on the phone.,5
A very respected financial institute,I appreciate the time the folks at Lendio took to help me out,5
Seamless and great web site to apply…,"I received excellent customer service from Morgan Larsen.  I had a problem applying for a PPP loan for my 2nd business that used data input from my 1st business.  Morgan was patient, efficient and took the necessary time to fix my problem.  And she was happy to help.  Rarely have I found such great service from a customer service representative.  Thanks Morgan!",5
Made progress quick and easy,"My experience with Lendio has been a nightmare! I can’t get anyone on the phone, funding managers change every day. When I did get someone on the phone a few weeks back, I was told by Morgan that I was approved and my loan docs were being completed and Legacy Bank is my lender and I should have funding by March 3rd (A lie, I spoke with Legacy Bank myself)  and they were getting ready to be put into the portal for me to accept. At that time she took the liberty to tell me the person handling my funding is Steve Fox. I tried to reach out to Steve but never any answer. Next day I look on the portal, my funding manager has changed to Misty Carol. I tried calling a few times and finally I emailed Misty about my status as I never received loan docs. Misty responds to tell me that the bank is requesting my articles of incorporation and EIN information, which Lendio has in their portal. Misty informs me via email that she can’t find it, I send it immediately and was reassured that I’m still on track for March 3rd.My gut told me that something just wasn’t right so I actually call Legacy Bank in Oklahoma to make that my file was in order and that was a client of Lendio. The lady at the bank told me that they have had so many clients of Lendio call them to complain that they had no choice but to take over handling the loans due to the service failures of Lendio. The rep informed that they HAVE NO LOAN DOCUMENT FOR ME!! I gave her my SBA information to research and now I’m back waiting. The Legacy Bank rep did inform me that due to me not having loan docs yet, there is no way that I would be getting funded by March 3rd! STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!! Has truly been a nightmare experience and I pray that SBA excludes them being a lender in the future.UPDATE: My new funding manager by the name of Alicia finally responded via email  with some stupid task of providing more documents and blaming it on SBA and Legacy Bank. I actually spoke with the lender at Legacy Bank in Oklahoma that handles the PPP loans and he made it very clear that Lendio is giving people the run around and doing the most unnecessary things that aren’t even required and that my file should’ve been completed and closed so they can submit it through their system to be submitted and funded. All of my verifications was able to be done while on the phone with the Legacy Bank Lender. The bank told me to give him 24hrs to get Lendio to stop playing games if I don’t see my loan docs in 24hrs, to call him back directly. STAY AWAY FROM LENDIO! A nightmare come true!!",5
The application process was fast and…,"Easy to apply, some documents were missing, they text me and let me know and I was able to gate my ppp very quick, thank you",4
Thanks,"Applied for second PPP loan through Lendio, against my better judgment. My credit union, anxious to get me funded, was put on hold when Lendio obtained an SBA number then told me that it would be difficult to cancel/withdraw so that I can get fundding. My application was completed with Lendio back in early February and as of two weeks ago they've had everything they needed, with the loan documents signed on 2/21/21. SBA regulations say that lenders must disburse funds within 10-days from recieving the SBA number ""The lender must make a one-time, full disbursement of the PPP loan within 10 calendar days of loan approval; a loan is considered approved when the loan is assigned a loan number by the SBA"" (SBA Website). THIS HAS NOT HAPPENED. I check the portal every day, up until yesterday it said it was complete and that Customers Bank had the loan, today it says ""Sent to Lender"". STAY CLEAR OF LENDIO!UPDATE: PLP was CANCELLED for lack of lender funding within 10-days, with ZERO contact from Lendio before I wrote this!!!",5
It was really difficult to get hold of…,Helped me with my PPP Loan. Got the funds quick and the application process was way easier than I anticipated. Highly recommend this company!,3
I signed closing docs a while back and…,The Lendio website has a wealth of information about the PPP Loans and how to apply.  I read over the information several times to make sure I had a complete understanding and then went for it.  Response time was impeccable.  Can't say enough good things about Lendio.,3
Working with Lendio was amazing,"I begin researching for lenders that accept ppp applications from self-employed employers, and there I saw Lendio. I filled out the application in about 2 minutes, which I loved because it was very simple. I got a response instantly. Afterwards, a follow-up email from Amanda Bartholomew, asking if I had an questions or concerns with the application, also she informed me of the documents I needed to upload to complete the application. I was allowed to call her in regards to my application, where she navigated me in the right direction to receiving my PPP Loan. She’s the BEST. I encourage anyone to let Lendio assist you with you loan!!!! #GREAT EXPERIENCE !!!",5
Beat lending company I’ve ever worked…,"The software was so mickey mouse on the back end that it sends you email after email to reload docs that are already in the system and to resign your application. It's really a joke how they slapped this together, even if you are able to actually complete the application good luck on getting it forgiven with the way the system processes info.  I know at least 2-3 other business owners that just gave up after the third try.  With shooty programming like this, I would not trust my banking info to be protected, AVOID Lendio!!",5
Great company thank you for helping me…,"I began my application on January 26th 2021 for my first draw ppp loan.  Needless to say,  the process has been anything but smooth or professional.  I recieved an email on February 5th with a link to sign my loan,  thinking I would receive my funds within at least 10 business days. Today, After nearly a month later,  I have yet to receive any funding.  I have attempted several times,  at least once a week to contact  my one of many different funding managers,  with no response.  The only time I can get anyone to respond is through the chat with customer service.  Even then,  nothing is being done.  The first customer service representative said he notified his manager and my funding manager of the issue,  and they would find out why I haven't received the funds. That was 11 business days after I signed the loan agreement. 3 days later,  I sent an email to my new funding manager,  not sure why a new one was assigned to my account.  After no response I reached out to customer service, again,  last Thursday. I was told that she had contacted my funding manager,  who said she had several meetings that day and would contact me as soon as possible.  It's been 3 business days,  with no response. I really feel like the company is understaffed, or not trained very well.  Also feel like I'm being given the runaround, since I've been given a loan number,  signed a loan agreement and have not received any funds, without any explanation for the delay,  past the 10 days the sba gives the lender to issue funds.",5
Great job communicating and helping…,"I have been passed between 10 DIFFERENT Lendio representatives in the last 30 days.  No loan, no lender,and ""I'll be in touch shortly to go over your application.""Which, has never happened.  Phone calls not answered or ""cannot be accessed."" Qualified loan amount reduced by more than 1/2 in final document with no explanation.",5
Service was great,Good and responsive customer service. Thank you!,5
They totally messed up my ppp.....,"Easy, Fast Process for Lending",1
Great and fast service!,The Lendio team were excellent to work with throughout the entire process. I was able to speak to a person and exchange emails directly when documentation or questions needed to be answered. Despite the delays and challenges with the SBA process I am pleased with how Lendio maintained the communication and worked through the issues.,5
Easy to fill out forms online,Lendio did a great job handling our PPP!  They were really fast!,5
Abysmal communication,"Lendio came through with me. Not a big hassle like the experience I had with other lenders. Professional, responded to my calls/email inquiries. Thank you Lendio.",1
"Everything was quick, but emails looked like spam!",Very thorough company that communicated well throughout the process.,4
Anthony was great on hearing the needs…,"The process was easy, but at times confusing. The process could be made more clear. Other than that it was easy and relatively straight forward.",5
Results were quick and efficient,"The process of applying for PPP started great. I applied on 2/7, talked to a real person on 2/8, and received an SBA number on 2/10. I received a call on 2/11 that a couple additional items were needed, which I immediately provided, and received confirmation on 2/12 they had everything needed. I followed up with my funding manager on 2/17, and she confirmed they had everything, and that I just needed to be patient and wait for funding. I decided to call customer service on 2/22 as the 10 days from SBA number had passed, and was once again told the file is complete and to wait patiently for funding. Worrying day 20 was approaching, I called again on 2/26. The csr said my application failed validation back on 2/12, as they needed 2 more items, and she didnt understand why my funding manager nor the csr I had spoken with on 2/22 didnt tell me. She was worried I could lose my lender and said she would have my new funding manager reach out right away, but I havent heard from them, though I did email them the additional documents. I would like to complete the process with Lendio, but if they cant help, I need to know so I can apply elsewhere before time/funding run out.",5
Lack of Follow Up/Follow Through,"Though some non-response to start, eventually one member was very responsive and helpful, and ultimately Lendio got my PPP Loan application to a lender who approved my loan. Easy process on Lendio's site.",3
Pleased but guarded,"Lendio was so quick to communicate, professional and great to work with!",3
Lendio is awesome,"Great service, very positive experience all around. Glad to have a solid loan resource moving forward. Will be talking to David Bernstein again and recommending him to friends who are in the market for a private loan.",5
It was the most horrendous experience,Great experience.,1
I applied for a loan through lending…,"Lendio was able, once again, to match me with a lender who funded my loan. Thank you. The only reason I am not giving them 5 stars for my PPP 2 experience is because when I had some difficulty navigating their online application, I reached out to them numerous times. Unfortunately, it took weeks for them to respond and when they did, I was already in the midst of submitting  an application directly to a lender (which I discontinued when Lendio finally responded to me).",1
easy to use,Excellent experience! Seamless and stress-free. Thanks for all your help Lendio!,5
Lendio process is very efficient and…,I'm happy i was ultimately able to get my PPP loan but I will say it took a LOT of back and forth and duplicate efforts to finalize.,5
This relationship has truly been a…,Complete and utter waste of time. So many positive reviews on here are obviously fake. Nice marketing campaign.,5
Lendio made the difference!,My experience was very positive.  The website and instructions were easy to navigate and follow.  Timeline expectations were met and I would recommend Lendio to others for their specific needs.Thank you!,5
ThankYou For Helping Me Secure A Loan!,"poor customer service when dealing with ppl loans, can't contact loan assistant, perhaps not interested in smaller loan apps, very disappointing",5
The electronic application process was…,I was very pleased with your service amd I appreciate your taking time to help me in a time of need. May God bless you.,5
Couldn't have been any easier...,"Excellent experience. In the toughest of times Lendio came through and I can see the finish line. I can do my part by staying vigilant, focused and working hard in these tough times. Thank you Lendio for helping me do so!Glenn King",5
Thank you so much for an easy process…,Overall experience was excellent. The PPP loan was completed in less than a month and the people were great to work with. Communication was good throughout the entire process. The only reason for a four star is the app could use a couple of small improvements. I would use Lendio again.,5
Efficient,Lendio was very quick in process my PPP. I am very happy with the service they provided.,5
When I first applied for my loan the…customer service was great.,Took over a month to process my 1st round PPP now I am trying to apply for the 2nd and cannot get anyone to contact me after numerous emails voicemails etc. This company is a joke. You would think bring the loan is only available until it runs out the customer service would be just a tad bit better than this. Hopefully week 3 of trying to reach someone will be better!,3
Process took way longer than…Terrible,Lendio is simply the best..all hope was lost but guys gave me a sign of relief..much appreciative for reviving my business and never disappointing me.,1
Great service,"None of my assigned funding managers have responded to my emails. I applied January 13 and today is February 26 with no answers. My homepage, which would list offers, says my application is incomplete but when I chat with a representative they tell me everything is fine. I have submitted every document multiple times. This has been a stressful experience and being a self employed hair stylist under incredible restrictions, I don’t even know that I will be approved for a loan I desperately need.Edited 17 days after review. STILL WAITING FOR MY PPP LOAN. There has been some communication from the  funding manager but no answers. Asking to please be patient. I applied January 13 and STILL waiting on an answer. The deadline is approaching and no one seems to be helping further along this process.",5
Lendio was the best experience I ever…,"Brady provided professional, experienced, and swift service when addressing our line of credit needs.",5
Poor communication,Well there were a few hiccups along the way Brock Blake the CEO of Lendio got personally involved and smoothed the way ultimately for the financing to arrive. I highly recommend Lendio out to anyone considering a PPP loan or even a regular business loan. Customer service at the Fort Lauderdale location is top notch. ask for Traci.,2
Lendio helps me to get a PPP loan that…,"O lord, I hope I have not gotten myself into a big prob. I just referred my women group to use them and I dad file two days ago. How do I stop my application, I am a single mum of three and just lost my, I can't afford to be tossed aside for so long I need a company that will help my flaws so I can get to take care of my kids. So I am d president of single mums in diaspora,and they are mostly registered business owners . Now I just sent them an email to hold off. How do I withdraw my application. I can't start with negative company,from the moment I submitted all they keep saying is we will request additional documents if need be. Why predict that,why not predict the lender will accept it and we will try. B",5
Poor timeliness,"I applied to the major 3rd party ""assemblers of information"" to submit to Lenders for PPP loans.  I am computer savvy and Lendio had the SMOOTHEST, most user friendly process, that I experienced.  One company promised a 5 minute process which took 2 hours.I don't often do reviews, however, given the volume of individuals like me, I whole heartedly recommend Lendio.  I also want to personally thank ""Julie Lautaimi"" for her professionalism and personal touch in fielding my questions.  Anyone reading this - watch the movie ""pay it forward"" and DO IT. Doug",1
You guys are awesome,"My experience with Lendio has not been a great one however one of the companies team lead did reach out to try and rectify the situation. The team lead explained  what happen took ownership for the failed communication and that was good enough for me, we all make mistakes. I am willing to move on.",5
Lendio did what needed to be done!,"on 2/11/21 I applied for ppp loan through Lendio and was submitted.  On the same day my Identity (social security, business account #) was compromised.  On the same day they opened and have attempted to open up accounts online and were in process of transfering funds from my business account.  I have to worry about this for the rest of my life.I have called and e-mailed Lendio several occasion about this issue and have not heard back.  At the onset I was trying to research the issue and make Lendio aware of this issue in case other applicants may face the same problem and but I have not heard back after two weeks.In addition, when asking about the status of my application, I am getting the same response which is no response.",5
It was a good experience,Best work compares to other lenders.Worked promptly and hard.,5
Excellent customer service,Great service. Very intuitive user experience. The live chat was very helpful as well. Overall very satisfied and will recommend to other businesses!,5
Excellent experiences - recommended!,"Update as of 3/2/2021: Lendio never tried to reach out to me despite there comment on this review, I continued to email, message, and call and still no return. I researched thru SBA site and found a local bank accepting PPP applications and was funded in less than 48hrs. There is no excuse for Lendio having my application for 6 weeks and changing my submit date several times to buy themselves time and no excuse for them sitting on it with an SBA approval number for over 2 weeks and they had all the correct paperwork to fund me. 1st time around with PPP loan they were on it and it went smoothly. This 2nd round has been nothing but chaos!! I've submitted the same paperwork to them countless times and each time they change my paperwork date. They sent my stuff to lender and lender kept requesting the paperwork and now they declined my app I called lender funding circle and they said they didn't have my app. Lendio will not respond back and now my app is sitting there with the status sent to lender and the SBA has already issued an approval and loan number. So much for the required 10days from SBA approval!! Heard they are only focusing on high dollar PPP loans and selling to the highest bidder. Forget us small businesses",5
Very helpful,I have been trying to speak with someone about my ppp lending for weeks and haven't gotten any answers or responses at all.EDIT AFTER RESPONSE:Yes I spoke with someone through your online chat system on 2/23 about not hearing anything about my first ppp draw for weeks after I signed my documentation. They said they spoke to their manager about escalating my issue then they signed off and I have heard nothing since. I am not applying for a second draw I am still in the process of my first draw. Please call or email me.,5
Worked with me to obtain ppp,Laura from CX was amazing and able to help me with my questions. She assured me I was on the right track and she maintained professional the entire call. Thanks!,5
From initial application to funding was…,answered all  questions and worked on my loan efficiently from start to finish!,5
Lendio was very good to work with for…,"1st draw PPP-applied day one in January 2021. Multiple emails received stating my app was deleted and i needed to reapply. I did, after 45 days of “application sent to lender status.” I started emailing. One person stated my schedule C wasn’t attached, it was. 60 days later I emailed daily and never heard back so I withdrew my application. Don’t waste your time if your a true small business.*reply to your response.. i did not obtain funding yet after wasting 2 months with Lendio",4
There were too many times I had to…,"We applied for a PPP loan through Lendio. From the beginning, the process was disorganized, the user interface was frustrating, and communication was lacking. They repeatedly asked me to upload documents I had already uploaded, and when I would reach to them by email or phone to clarify what was missing, there was no response. Although we did eventually get our loan, the process was not transparent, and AFTER we had received the loan in our bank account we received an email asking us to resubmit everything again with a new signature, which made no sense at all. I wouldn't recommend any business owners apply for a loan through Lendio until they've figured out their user interface and customer service.",3
Great response time,They did a very good job for me and really appreciate it.,5
Fast & Simple,"Lendio has helped me fund my business twice. Great follow-up, and excellent efforts. i highly recommend them!",5
Lendio was a lifesaver,I used Lendio for both opportunities and it is a smooth process.  Recommend them highly.,5

Lendio is the best thanks again,The process was confusing but I did receive my PPP,5
Very professional company,"Good Job Lendio, the process wasn't as fast as they advertise but nevertheless it worked out.",5
Michael was fantastic!!!,"Lendio = waste of time and resources during a time every second count!  Lendio has successfully provided the WORST experience ever!  I was approved, accepted the offer was waiting for the lender to contact me then started seeing on the Lendio website that my app was ""withdrawn"" and that I was marked as ""no contact"".  I did not withdraw my application and I did not ask to be put on a no-contact list.  Noone at Lendio can tell me how or why this happened.  They do not return my calls, chat messages or emails.  I am resourceful but can not find a soul at Lendio that gives 2 cents about me, my business, or providing answers.  I am a 23 year professional with good credit.  I just don't understand how this behavior can be allowed to go on and on - as I have seen in other posts as well and nothing is done about it.  Karma is a .....well, you know.UPDATE:  Lendio I received your responses however, I require a detail explanation of exactly why I was so completely ditched by Lendio. I already have other financing approved however, it CANNOT move forward because I have an active app witH LENDIO. Again, my next steps depend on yours...03022021 Today I decided to take a different approach:Dear SBA –I am truly at my wits end. I applied for a PPPII loan through Lendio. I was made an offer, accepted it and was told I’d hear from my lender soon. I understand the Lender was to be Benworth. Next thing I know there is a message on the Lendio site that my app has been withdrawn – I did not withdraw it. Then when I tried to login to Lendio’s site but could not - I received a “no contact” message. I was able to login through Facebook and my application is gone. I’ve emailed Lendio so many times, left phone messages and tried on Social Media to contact Lendio. I have been given no response as to why all of this happened. The lender quit talking to me too. I am so confused and disgusted.I applied through my credit union was approved and they were ready to fund but said SBA is kicking back my app because the Lendio app is still showing in the system.I am a professional with good credit. Please tell me what to do. Is there is a formal complaint process?Mary Garlock",5

Clear and Simple Process,"Applied for PPP and was approved and received SBA number on 2/3. Signed Promissory note on 2/16. Still am not funded. Benworth hasn’t called nor given any sort of an acceptable timeframe.Update 3/2/2021:Still not funded.Alfredo with Benworth said my application was accidently canceled on 2/25, he assured me he would take care of this and to allow him 2 business days.  I did get a call back from Landon with Lendio in response to my review here letting me know that he would be reaching out to the lender to check on this.Yesterday 3/1:I emailed Alfredo back with Benworth to check on the status, he states they are waiting on Lendio to reinstate my loan. He then tells me with the new rules I can get more money if I start a new application and then I can let him know. I said no. It would only be $300 dollars more and we are a month in on my current application.I then used the Lendio chat with Donna asking about the status of my loan, she asked if my email address changed that she sent for a agent to reach out to me. That was after 30 minutes of no response.I then also forwarded my email chain between Alfredo with Benworth and I to my funding manager Robert with Lendio. That went as follows2/22 Benworth(Alfredo) asked for tax return for 2019.2/23 replied to make sure he received my 2019 tax return and where in processing is he.2/24 Response Stating my 2019 tax return doesn’t have a schedule C.I Responded that is correct, that I just started the end of 2019 as a independent contractor and didn’t make enough to get a 1099. So I sent him my 2020 schedule C.2/25 I sent another email Alfredo asking what is going on. That now on CAWEB.SBA.GOV shows fully cancled for my loan status. He said it was canceled by error. He could reinstate my application however he would need my bank statements in order to process my loan. I sent those and he said to allow him 2 business days to reinstate my application.Now I used the Lendio chat and was told that its noted on 2/17 they needed my tax return. I said well that can not be right, she offered to have my funding manager contact me.In my review nobody has any idea whats going on. The only thing I can trust is the SBA website showing my loan as fully canceled.This has been the longest month and I am no where near funding.",5

Great,I applied for a PPP loan for my business using Lendio and it has been a horrible experience.  They changed the loan amount on my application and submitted it to SBA without my approval.  Their calculations are completely off and do not match any of the paperwork I submitted.  I use ADP for all my reports so I do not know how they messed it up.  The worst part is that they did not even contact me to inform me of the changes so I never signed off on it.   I cancelled my application and my EIN needs to be released from the SBA database by Lendio so I can apply elsewhere.   I have repeatedly called and emailed and no one is responding.  I was working with Alex Enriquez and he is completely unresponsive.  It seems they are purposely doing this so I can't apply for a PPP loan elsewhere.  It's been weeks without any response.  There are better options out there if you want good customer service.Update:  I found out that the funding manager deleted all my information from their database.  Probably because to hide his mistakes and shady practice.  I still have not gotten a response from anyone from Lendio.  My business has a SBA Number with a lender that Lendio assigned to me that I do not even know who it is.,5
PPP Loan Application,Process was simple everyone I dealt with was friendly,5

From discussing with a representative to help me find various loan options, to PPP loans, etc., they were always responsive to my needs. Even in the thick of the original PPP Loan Process (when everyone was getting bogged down trying to get their info in), my representative made me feel secure that he was going to keep with me the entire way. From there, having the information and knowledge shared from video conferences with the heads of Lendio, I felt more appreciated and respected than with any other lender I've had an experience with. I look forward to always working with them for my business in the future and cheer them on for their continued success!",5
Super Smooth process,Great customer service and fast and friendly reps!! I got funded quicker with Lendio.,5
Lendio offers great support and ease!,*UPDATE*The funds came in 6 days after I applied so it ended up being a timely and efficient experience besides some small lack of communication. Thank you!---------OLD postEverything went well until after I submitted my document for the PPP loan. I still had so many questions and also just wanted to know what was next. After I submitted my documents I never heard back from Lendio when I would contact them. I called them 3 times with voicemails and emailed the agent I was assigned as well. No response.,5

The account team was good at email and calling to make sure my application was completed properly.  Nice folks.We did have trouble after I had entered my full application and then I had to do it all over again.  After that, some parts of signing the loan form was still not being read at the Lendio backroom of the site when I had already done them on the website for me to see as an applicant.  I had to take screenshots of what I was seeing to provide final documentation.  But that only took an extra day.I did get the loan and so all is fine in the end.  Mark",5

Lendio has been a pleasure to work with.,Lendio really dropped the ball with getting my paperwork to the lender so they could fund my loan. I started calling after the 16th day of getting my SBA loan number and was able to get funded on the 20th day! After calling multiple times per day I was able to get it done.

The application was simple, platform was easy to use and to follow status. When there was a question someone was there to answer and guide me through the process. I was not concerned with the required documents needed, as long as you can prove you are legitimate and have clean records and valid business licensing I thought the verification steps were or should be routine. My business was verified very quickly then connected with a lender. I appreciate all the work Lendio and my lender did to help get some much needed relief in a short time. Very thankful! I recommend Lendio and partners for your business needs and solutions.",5

I still don't know how/where to submit my forgiveness application. Lendio says it goes to Customers Bank, and Customers Bank says it goes to Lendio. I think you need to be much clearer with your clients. I have had some email interactions with Ready Capital and they were not able to help. Why, Lendio?",5

TERRIBLE!,"If I could give 0 stars I would. I'm not one to leave negative reviews but I have to warn people about this one. Lendio is the absolute worst. My PPP loan was submitted the very first day applications opened and now, February 23rd, I have still gotten nowhere. I have been bounced around from loan manager to loan manager, each new rep telling me that my application is ""missing information."" I have submitted that ""missing info"" to each new rep that asked about it within 2 hours tops, and each time they've told me my application was now submitted to the SBA. Only for the cycle to continue over and over and over again. And now, I've just gotten an email from them saying ""it's been a while since we've heard from you- we are going to withdraw your application in 24 hours if we don't hear back."" Absolute worst experience I've had with a company professionally. 0/10 would absolutely NOT recommend.",2

Ashlie Snowball was the only human being on the Lendio side who took the time to help me sort it out.

The loan was handled efficiently and on…,"Dan Davis, our Lendio Finance Consultant, is the main reason I'm taking time out of my busy schedule to write this review.  I also want small businesses to know that Lendio is there to help you in a timely manner. Dan went above and beyond for the customers and prospective customers of Lendio. Throughout the last several months of COVID-19's destruction on businesses, Dan was consistently checking in on our status and advising us on our application and PPP needs. We were one of the ""smallest fish"" so it wasn't because we were a big deal account...Dan's interactions communicated true concern for small businesses. I will also add that Lendio's CEO and company have been at the forefront with PPP information, preparation advisement, and lending throughout the last several months.  When the first round of PPP came out and the small businesses were trumped by bigger businesses, Dan, our Lendio Finance Consultant, personally took control of many of the small business applications to get the funding to those that qualified.  I know that he worked early mornings even on weekends communicating with businesses on their applications in both rounds as I was one of the many business owners waiting every day for the PPP and would receive emails from him checking in.  In the first round of PPP, he even suggested trying other lenders at the same time so that small businesses like ours would get funding before the funds ran out and continued to communicate with us until we received funding. That's putting the customer before the company and rare to see these days. Our company received funding for both rounds of PPP with Lendio (it’s Feb 2021 and we are already funded with round two) and have referred many others to Lendio because of the excellent service and communication I received from Dan Davis at Lendio. Lendio gets the job done in a timely manner.  Can't say that for the 4 banks we do business with by the way. Dan at Lendio gave the service you get from a small-town bank where you know your banker as a neighbor and he contacts you to help your business instead of what happened in most of the country with the banks and lenders who wouldn't call back for months and still didn't know what they were doing..that was the dark reality for most small businesses in most of the country. But not if you are a customer of Lendio.Last, the information about PPP rounds over the last year has been accurate coming from Lendio and that's important since accuracy is so important when making decisions as a small business owner. The preparation for the second round of PPP wasn't as stressful because we knew we were with Lendio and they would keep us updated on the timing and steps when PPP would start again.  We were also advised accurately on the timing of funding and forgiveness amounts so we could make wise decisions on our funding decisions.  I hope this helps other small business owners know that Lendio is there to help you so we as business owners can persevere and continue to be viable as employers and continue to be innovative while supporting our communities and making our country strong.",5
Team at lendio is great to work with,"Lendio has been wonderful.  I applied for my PPP on 1/12.  My application was approved on 2/15, and my loan was deposited to my account on 1/22.

Great service and great employee.,"There were glitches on Lendio's PPP loan application site. During the process, I hit a catch 22 situation and I was not sure if my application was submitted or not. I repeated the process a few times. I understood that the glitches may have been caused by the flood of applications. I decided to wait it out and received some follow-up emails from Lendio in the meantime. Then I got a notice from Lendio guiding me to complete my application that in fact was signing of the loan agreement. I have not applied for PPP1, It was my brand new experience to get a loan from SBA or anywhere else. A few days after signing the Agreement, I saw the applied fund credited to my checking account. I am glad that my small application was duly processed all right by Lendio during this hectic period of PPP loan disbursement. I thank Lendio for their hard work and due process for my small PPP loan application.",5

He was available for questions every step throughout the process and was extremely knowledgeable about a wide variety of products to be able to meet our immediate needs. I had many calls from other capital companies, but Lendio took the time out to clearly understand our business and immediate needs to find the product that worked best for our business. The other item we felt was important as a business fairly new to taking out a position is the need build business credit which the lender we were connected with reports on every payment. I would recommend Lendio to friends and colleagues looking to fund business projects to take care of their Customers.",5
Great information given by rep,The process was simple and the customer service and support was just as accommodating.  Lendio was very prompt in getting back with me to let me know if they needed anything further from me so the approval process and funding wouldn't be delayed unnecessarily.  I wouldn't go anywhere else forbid if I ever had to experience this need again.,5

Great group of professionals to get…,"It all began with an ad when I was strolling through my email. After waiting weeks for an application from my first round lender I decided to call Lendio glad I did. I talk to Maria Paula Silverio so patient and knowledgeable about the program. After walking me through the application and requesting very little documents Ms. Maria went to work for my company. After about 2 days of me shuffling through my miss filing I was able to locate what was needed to get the money to keep the door open. I received my underwriting document on the 2 day of applying I signed and returned after about 48 hr I received and email from the loan officer Mr. Kasper Ciszek asking for a simple bank statement to verify business was open at the beginning of the pandemic February 2020 no problem sir. Although we shared a missed communication due to an over site of the loan officer he was more than apologetic and immediately move my business loan to the last stage which was funding. Great news I was over joyed with teary eyes to know that this happened in less than 10 days. I never wrote a review before about anything but I just had to tell the world if I could how easy this process was. Although it felt unbelievable but let me tell you when that deposit hit the account I just was in silent and thankful to all who made this happen. So for all of you still trying to get funded please contact them. Email, call, before the deadline and your business miss out. I have a big mouth I already have told just about everyone I know who own a business and missed out on round 1 due to complicated lenders. Thanks you SBA for selecting them to be a PPP lender without a team like Lendio and BenCapital(Lender) the small businesses would go unnoticed.

The other 2 did not follow up with me as Lendio did, did not explain to me what was happening with my application, as Lendio did.  The other 2 only sent me a series of meaningless, auto-generated emails, which Lendio didn't. Lendio funded me fully while the other 2 were either radio silent, or 3 processing steps behind Lendio.",5

Great company,Let Leo did a very good job of obtaining a loan for me but once my application was submitted to the SBA that’s just when the breakdown in communication internally obviously occurred because I received no less than 30+ emails and poor phone calls from a different person every time saying that they were assigned to my application and they were going to be submitting it soon. I continued to get these emails and/or phone calls Well after my loan was already Funded. I reached out to the “funding manager” and explain to him what has been going on and I explained also that feedback is a gift and do with it what you will. I never heard back from him saying thank you I appreciate the advice no response,5

Good service.,"I was introduced to Lendio in April of 2020 by a colleague.  My current bank of many decades was extraordinarily unhelpful in processing our PPP application, and worse yet, wasn't responsive to our concerns about getting information.  Even though I had never heard of Lendio, I felt that I had nothing to lose, so reached out.  They were amazing.  Not only did they have knowledgeable, responsive staff who knew exactly what to do, how the process worked, what information to provide and how, they followed up at every step to make sure we were doing it right and completely.  We received our funding on the schedule they projected.  We are not a large company and we had had no previous contact with Lendio, but they came through for us in a way that our long established  bank has never behaved.",5

Nice to work with,Lendio helped me with both my PPP loans. I had a great experience and the crew was very helpful along the way. My case manager Maria Ruiz is AWESOME!,5
As an individual who has been…,"We tried applying for a PPP loan twice with our bank, Wells Fargo.The first time, back in April, they said we didn’t upload all our documents. We were surprised at that as we knew we uploaded our Schedule C’s and payroll documents as requested.At the time, we were still holding up with our company so we decided to not bother with it and moved on.Fast forward to the end of 2020 we were struggling financially with our company. We heard that another round of PPP loans were being offered so we jumped right on it again, again applying to our bank, Wells Fargo.Within a couple of days we received an email saying our application was being processed which made us feel good thinking that we had uploaded the correct items this time. A week and a half later, we were told by Wells Fargo in an email that we were not approved for a PPP loan. When looking in the email, it stated that we were not approved because we did not upload the required documents! So that is twice now that Wells Fargo has told us this. We called Wells Fargo and a representative told us that she had been told at other customers had experienced the same thing as well. Unfortunately, as she was transferring us to a manager, we were disconnected. Then we called back and we were disconnected again. The third Wells Fargo representative laughed when we told her what the first representative told us, that other customers were having the same issues with their PPP application. She stated that was “not accurate” information. She then stated that she would look into it and we would receive a call within 24 to 48 hours. No call came.We called back and asked another Wells Fargo representative about it, and were told that there is no system that would require them to call us within 24 to 48 hours. She said it didn’t exist.She then told us that they would look into it and they would contact us with any information they could find. We then realized our mortgage company  US Bank was offering to help getting PPP loans. It took us to Lendio which had an easy application and actually had a progress timeline of the application, unlike Wells Fargo.In a week, we were approved and funded for our PPP loan. Can’t believe how easy it was.To this day, we have not heard from our bank of 12 years, Wells Fargo.",5

Thankyou,Lendio was great with my PPP process.,2
Very satisfied with service,"I applied through WOMPLY and got sent to Lendio. I applied with Lendio as sole proprietor and application was submitted successfully on Jan 22nd. I received underwriting from sba thru Lendio for my loan on Feb 15. And I got my deposit next day, overall I think Lendio was the smoothest and easiest lender to go with. As I applied with Crossriver and blue vine and kept needing to reload several documents over n over. And then still got denied by those two. With Lendio, when I uploaded and submitted the application it was successfully submitted on the first time. And I got little updates here and there from Lendio until I got the underwriting email and funds. Hope this helps someone 😉",5
Excellent service,"These people are amazing. From the initial e mail to the funds appearing in my bank happened it about 1 weeks time. No red tape, no bureaucracy. The forms were easy to fill out, the on line phone help was great and the next thing I knew the funds were in my bank.",5

Enjoyed but  after speaking to a…,"Kathryn Hansen was the most helpful person who I have ever met in guiding us through the simple yet stressful PPP application process.   Whenever she found we were missing some documents, she would immediately message, text and even call us.   I can only recommend Her and Lendio in these difficult times, because they guarantee you are in the right hands.  The entire process took less than 5 days, which included us being somewhat amateurs in gathering all the paperwork together.Perfect experience!",4
The instructions were easy to follow…,"Lendio was quick to approve our PPP loan.  If there was any question about how to fill it out or what was meant, they responded quickly to my email.  They even called me once to update me on the status of the loan and to tell me that they were the new contact person.  Normally I would have gone through Chase because that's who our business banks with, but they weren't accepting applications as early as Lendio was.  I do not regret my decision to proceed with Lendio - would definitely recommend them.",5
Friendly,Excellent service. Extremely knowledgeable. Quick and easy!,5
Very smooth process,"I'm updating this following a remarkable call I got from a very senior officer at Lendio, who expedited my application to the point of completion/bank approval of loan.  Given the problems described below, I'm hesitant to go to 5 stars, but the responsiveness, as well as who responded, is noteworthy to say the least.  The company clearly cares about its customers.  I can't speak for what transpired below, but the bottom line is the company responded practically immediately (within minutes), and I'm good to go.  I am in the process of applying for a second-draw PPP loan.  I have had roughly 7 rounds of back-and-forth emails wherein the Lendio contact is asking me for documents that the bank requires.  (Lendio functions as a middle-man between the borrower and lender.)  I have repeatedly asked for help with uploading extra documents required by the lender.  The website interface didn't provide for uploading the documents in question.  These are run-of-the-mill business documents.  It has been weeks and no progress.  Then I got another rep asking me for different documents, one of which I supplied.  The remaining document required clarification.  That was requested 2-3 weeks ago - no response.  I then sent this contact a request to cancel my loan application.  In the case of an SBA PPP loan, that's referred to as the ETRANS number withdrawal.  Why am I asking for that?  Because while my business needs the funds, I've had to go looking for another lender.  That lender has approved my loan.  But they will not release the funds until the prior application is cancelled.  Therein lies the problem.  I've tried several times to get help in uploading documents, asking about clarification on documents, etc., to no avail.  Now, they won't answer my simple email asking them to cancel the transaction.  As I write this, I'm on hold with the SBA, since I'm not sure what else I can do.  Total disgrace.",4
Lendio is efficient and fast to process…,Very satisfied with the process.  Highly recommend.,5
Excellent!,I've used Lendio two times now and both times they delivered. Would definitely use again and recommend to others.,5
Best of the best,"While I ended up getting a loan from Lendio, it was not an easy task. I initiated every contact to check status and at each call they would tell me they were waiting on some document from me. I would otherwise not have any idea because their online system would state all documents were turned in and completed. Also, I started off with one person and went through four different staff members before it was all said and done. I would have liked to have known that before the process started as I felt passed around. Bottom line is that if you plan to use Lendio for a loan, keep in mind you will need to actively call and email to move your file along expeditiously.",5
Paige checked on my file even after it…,Thank you for making my loan request easy and funding me in a timely manner. Your representatives were very helpful and made time to make sure my demands were met in order to get the funding we needed.,5
Thanks to Lendio I was able to get both rounds!,Excellent customer service and quick and very simple process. 100% recommended!,5
They made it easy,"Went through Lendio on the first round and it was awesome. Decided to stick with Lendio on the 2nd round and it was a bit different. Very difficult to get in touch with our Funding Managers, but finally was put it touch with Julie Allred and Kathryn Hansen. They are great - explained everything and were very helpful in finalizing our application and getting it to SBA and the bank. Hopefully the funding will be soon and am grateful for the help from these two employees. Very professional and informative.",5
THANK YOU LENDIO,Lendio helped me access SBA funding to keep my small business solvent during these uncertain times.  The application process was straightforward.  The negatives were redundant communications regarding supporting documents that had already been uploaded to the portal.  Additionally my contact rep changed multiple times throughout the process making communication suboptimal.  At the end of the day Lendio got it done and I would recommend them to others seeking an SBA loan or other loan options.  Thank you Lendio team!,5
Awesome job done,"Got my 2nd PPP loan processed in a quick and easy way. Wasn't super easy to get in touch with someone, probably due to the high volume of requests, but it got done and I'm grateful for their help.",5

Challenging,They made the PPP app process super easy,3
Thank you so much for the help,The process was simple customer service is great,5
Excellent experience.,"Overall my loan was completed fairly fast and easily. The only confusing thing was the emails I received after completing my application. The first email came back with a couple items I needed to provide. I went back to the portal to add them even though I knew I already had. Sure enough they were already there, but without being able to talk to anyone, I simply added them again. Then later I received another email. Again with requests for documents. There were two listed in the email. Again one of them was already on the portal, and again I added it another time. The other document in the email was not an option to upload on the portal, so it didn't get uploaded. I replied to the email both times with no response. So I had no idea what was happening or if I would qualify at all. Very confusing.In the end it all went through without any issues. I just don't see what good these random email requests were.",5
Lendio did a great job getting me the…,"I used Lendio for PPP loan, I had applied to 2 other banks as well as  I didn’t want to be left out if funds dried up and know some banks are just so slow. Lendio was the 1st to get back to me about my application.

"Lendio pertinent, efficient, and sustainable !",Process was very easy. Customer service was very helpful and knowledgeable.,5
Not sure why Lendio is asking for a 5-Star review,"First PPP was smooth and went through quickly. Second PPP had a lot of challenges. Either system or the processing agents (there were several hand offs between agents) didn't review thoroughly, which meant for us to repeatedly load same information several times. When we chatted with the online chat agents, they mentioned that there were several platform challenges. Glad it finally was processed.",1

Lendio honest review,"I went through the first PPP process with BB&T and it was challenging and extremely stressful. So, when second PPP chance came around I tried Lendio, and I am so grateful that I did! The processes was seamless, easy, and if I was ever missing anything real people reached out to assist me. I swear my funding manager, Marianne Levy, said the same missing document to me like 10 times on the phone, because I was so concerned I'd get the wrong one. She was so sweet and kind the whole time. Then, when I sent something incorrect she responded quickly thanking me for emailing her, but letting me know there was an error I needed to fix. When I called with a question, someone kind was always there to take my call and help. I am seriously so grateful for Lendio's support.",5

They was great,"Appreciate Lendio, being an online financial services firm for being the conduit for the PPP Loan!Overall the website/application was easy to use.  What I found frustrating is previously loaded documents (albeit confirmed) were subsequently asked by a CSR to load the documents.  So in a few instances I had to upload the same document three times.Also, not sure how possible this is by it's best to have one CSR assigned to your loan app.  When I first filled out the app, I heard from several different names.  At one point I did get on the phone to try to call and was unsuccessful in reaching that CSR.  I often wondered even if that person existed?Would use again, but looking for more continuity in the service.",5

Skip the stress - go directly to the lender,"For the most part the Lendio service was seamless and simple. The one issue I'd had was that the loan portal's download pages could be more intuitive and present documents accurately to Lendio representatives. I received several emails asking for documents that had been downloaded at my initial application. It's a minor detail, but could be more accurate. Once I spoke to a Lendio representative about my file however, the loan funded in a few days. Very efficient for the most part and I enjoyed my experience. Thank you.",1

Love how fast and sufficient they were…,Very helpful customer service. Online interface was easy to use,5
it took a long time for my application…,"Overall, I really appreciated the successful outcome, especially in a relatively short period of time. The duration of the entire Lendio experience and process only took a bit over four weeks from application to funding. The back-and-forth of document handling, repeating document uploads on the platform and via email, and working with multiple, constantly changing Lendio account reps can be discouraging/confusing. Hang in there. I just stayed positive, rolled with it, stayed in proactive contact with the Lendio team, and it worked. I am very satisfied. Thank you.",4

Very fast...,"I highly recommend Lendio.  The company processed my second round PPP in a timely manner.  I received a voicemail message from Lendio to correct a PDF file.  When the call was returned, I immediately reached a live representative for clarification.  The correction was made by me and no further actions were required.   A few days later I signed the SBA promissory note and shortly after the funds appeared in my bank account.  Lendio's on-line form was tailored to meet the needs of the SBA.  The timely response of the Lendio's team was EXCELLENT.  These two factors set Lendio apart from large banks such as Wells Fargo.  In parallel, I submitted an application to Wells Fargo and to this date, Wells Fargo has yet to get back to me with a response from the SBA.   Needless to say, it was a good idea to contact Lendio in addition to seeking the funding from Wells Fargo.  Lendio is better suited to meet the needs of small businesses that need such funds in a prompt manner.",5

Easy,Very quick to locate funding. Only negative is that when I emailed questions they went unanswered. Would still use Lendio again and suggest to others.,5
It was a long process but very good…,"Our experience with Lendio has been nothing but frustrating. After submitting our application, they randomly ask for documents that they already have. It's been several weeks since they said our loan has been sent to the lender. Now they are saying (again) that they need more documentation. They asked us to verify the payroll of our employees, but we don't have any employees! Now they want us to verify our address, but they already have our address on five different pieces of documentation and they're saying the need it yet again! I've called, texted, and emailed the account manager (of which we have had multiple) and no one will ever get back to us. This is at least third account manager we've had, and she (nor the others) ever respond.I'm concerned if this loan will ever get funded. I can't ever speak with anyone who knows what's going on. Someday in the near future when this ppp loan is to be forgiven, will they be able to handle that part of the process?  Will I be stuck with no response from them like I have been for weeks now?",5
It was a real smooth process,Lendio has been great to work with. Easy to apply and get funding and great communication.,5
Appreciate their communication &…,"Samantha Montez, Louis Aquino, Caden Santiago, Nell Quinn, Ajae A., Ishmael Kollieand Daniel Jensen all have been instrumental in handling my loan application. I realize that Lendio received over 100,000 applications since the 2nd Round of PPP program inception, so some delays were expected and understandable. I chose Lendio and applied on 1/15/2021 as small minority business to try and beat the rush of large banks loaning out to larger businesses. But my application didn't really get attention until middle of February as it was sent from one funding manager to the next in the validation process without much feedback on what was needed. It felt as if the application was just sitting and when I repeatedly called, the simple answer was someone is looking at it. Additionally, I called, texted and emailed daily to chase different funding managers to ensure that the correct information was provided to substantiate the correct loan amount. However, I didn't get any concrete answers regarding why the documents I provided was sufficient or not. My goal was to make their job as easy as possible because I understood the influx of how many applications there were in the process. My fear was that because days and weeks were passing by without any real status updates, I was sincerely afraid that I would not be considered for a loan because funding would run out. Despite these frustrations on the validation process because being passed from various funding manages with very little explanation on where the application was in the process or why the funding amount was significantly lower than what my average monthly payroll substantiated, these individuals were patient and responsive to helping resolving the problem as quickly as possible. Had it not been for these individuals prompt feedback, the Lendio experience would have been extremely disappointing. However, because of their genuine care and concern and because they took the time to discuss the challenges with my application, it redeemed my confidence with the Lendio team. Thank you to these individuals who made a 180 degree experience for me with Lendio worthwhile.",5

quick response,"Lendio was great! We applied for our second round PPP loan on February 3rd and received the DocuSign with ReadyCap Lending on Feb 10th. We got funded (money in our bank account) on Feb 17th. They even had a personal account manager assigned to you so you could call with questions. We used PayPal for our first round, which was very seamless, but PayPal seems to be having more glitches for this second round. Glad we went with Lendio!",5
Very positive experience securing PPP…,"This company knows what their doing for sure! They stayed on my application and kept emailing, calling and texting letting me know what docs they needed!

I found entire process with Lendio very…,"applied for second round ppp you would think the sba would already have most info just a simple upload of a few documents to easy right, wrong this is horrible 16 days and still in review for something we have already taken before asked repeatedly for documents go to upload page and there they are already uploaded then emails not answered the amount of incompetency is something to consider went this route cause I had a some extra time and didn't want to go to bank, back home beings we work out of town  well my mistake as I said go this route if you want to be jerked around and not taken serious!!!",5

They’re completely disorganized,Lendio was a pleasure to work with for my PPP. Loan.They were diligent and available to help answer my loan questions. All loans should be so smooth! TY Lendio and the agents who helped make it happen!!!,1
Lendio just made it easy,"Kept me hanging for a while for no reason. The assigned person would not answer my emails. The customer service was friendly but not able to do much. I was told after two weeks that the assigned person was moved and another person took over. She was friendly and moved it to the next level. After a while, I had to upload the same documents again. Then after a month, I get a document from Docusign (nothing from Lendio!). I had to find out which bank was assigned from the document, and call them to find out when funding would happen.  I went with Lendio because they opened the process before my bank. In hindsight, I should have just waited.After my review, Lendio called me and apologized. He was friendly and looks like they are serious about customer service.",5
Thanks,Lendio got me in touch with great lenders for PPP first and second round. I think Lendio did an amazing job and would recommend to anyone.,5

Lendio was really fast to get our PPP…,"The customer service was always helpful.  The process was fast.  The website upload was a bit glitchy, and changes were made requiring new uploads, but the customer service was very helpful.  The company was dealing with a lot of people requesting PPP Loans so its completely understandable.  Customer service made up for any short comings given the speed in which they worked.  Once a lender got on our paperwork, things moved very quickly.  I gave 5 out of 5 stars even thou the website was difficult, but if you are patient with them you should be happy with the outcome.",5
Excellent company fast and friendly,Thank you for processing my PPP so easily!,5
Very helpful and solved issue…,"The application form was not difficult which is a plus.  I was a bit frustrated by not being able to get someone on the telephone, but I eventually used the chat button and did get a response. I got approved fairly quickly.  I would recommend your service.",5

Communication was a little rocky but they made up for it by getting my loan processed as they said when we finally spoke on the phone.

"Communication is poor, wished I'd used my bank",Your response time was quick and much needed in this pandemic.. I appreciate your business,2
The process was easy and efficient.,"2/4 Initial Application completed. The process started off expeditiously, to which I was initially excited.  My first rep, not very professional  But, was exceptionally studious when it came to documentation.  Then, as many many of the reviews state.  The fun began..  new funding manager who has been silent, despite multiple attempts of contacting ( email, phone, text) and have been ignored.   I am being patient, due to the volume I am sure they are handling.  But..  two days of not even responding..  I fire my employee's for that level of petulance.... (1 star)Update. 2/18  Shortly after the review (as in an hour) I did receive a call from a Lendio (2nd Funding Manager) with an update.  ""The previous rep did not resubmit docs""  A few minutes later, I received a phone call from a member of the Customer Experience team.  Expressing concern and the promise to work with funding manager to ensure funding. Then asked if I would remove the negative review or edit with a positive one. ( 2 stars)Update 2/21-Recieved text early Sunday morning from Customer saying my contract was emailed on Friday!! JUBULATION!!  I didn't recall seeing it, nor would I think I would miss this email.  But, alas.. I could find no email even after a feverish look through every email and folder.   Then, thought the news was good enough and I'll wait until Monday. ( 3 Stars)Update 2/22-  After numerous attempts (email text, phone). Midday, I received a text confirming my email on file and the contract was emailed Friday.  I expressed that I did not and asked specifically for a solution or options. Should be easy.. resend or try another email. Then they went ""dark"" the rest of the day.   I've had no response from Customer Experience member since the text on Sunday morning.Once again, trying to be patient...  the angst of the news and the stress of not receiving them. Coupled with ambiguously sparse communication from Lendio.  Does test one's patience, not to mention raises questions.I'm really hoping for something tomorrow. ( 2 Stars)2/23- Mid morning update.  No word from 2nd funding manager nor the Customer Experience member.   The online portal did update, showing I've been assigned my THIRD ""funding manager"".  This is either progression or blatant ""C.C""..  Sending email & text to new funding manager now...Update 2/27:  RECIEVED CONTRACT FOR SIGNATURES!!   (Last step funding...)Update 3/4-  Still have not received funds, a week later.  3 other reps.  Initially told 3-5 days, then 7 it is now 7 and not much correspondence.  Still being patient.  I believe the bank has 10days to fund, once you've received the SBA loan# ?Update 3/6- Received a text saying new manager was going to give me an update.  Never did..  Nor responded to my additional texts.Update 3/8-  No funds, still not much communication at all. it's been 13 Calendar days since signing docs. Starting to question the validity of the contract I signed and regretting not going with my personal bank.  Who have now closed their PPP app...  smh...Update 3/9- still not a word ( multiple emails, texts and a voicemail)Update 3/10- Finally received an email saying there was a mistake on the signatures and I needed to resign and a request was sent to the lender to resend documents. Update 3/11-  multiple emails, text as well as a phone call sent.  No word.Update 3/12-  once again.  multiple emails, texts and voicemails and no response.   Received text just before 5pm informing to look in my email for the signature docs.  nothing..3/15- multiple emails and texts sent and phones.  Zero response.I've never experienced this level of horrendous service before.  SOOOOOO FRUSTRATING, to be waiting for an email for almost an entire week and having been sent only one update via text.3/16- Received email @ 945am, saying lender was sending email.  Received new signature email, as well as a phone call from an executive with lendio.  Explaining the situation as well as apologizing for the delay.  Greatly appreciated.  Excited to finally resign the Docs.  DOCS SIGNED3/22-  Still Have not received funds.  Rather alarming as I log into my Lendio account, and what said approved, with an SBA number ( that I signed a loan agreement for on 3/16 with the bank)  now says Received 3/10 Under review with no SBA number, it looks like everything started over?   3/25- STILL NOTHING!!3/29-  PROMISED A RETURN CALL with an update after realizing they screwed up by failing to submit documents they had and already submitted.3/31- still crickets",5
Overall quick and effective,"Great service, Great communication. Got my Second round PPP funded!  Thanks Lendio!",5
He was Dominique McKinney,"Dear Lendio Team,Thank you so very much for a excellent superior professional experience!! It was more than a delight having the opportunity to work with Lendio's small business funding team. Ms. Lily Johnson, Mr. Chandler Krisk were exceptional, true professionals in everyway. If we only had more financial lenders like Lendio we would be much better off in this fight against this pandemic and all the horror that has come with it. A million thanks!, to Lendio a kind, professional, understanding and truly a Financial institution that cares about the clients! Wonderful experience working with Lendio and there Team! Well Done!",5
Well I have no complaints,Lendio did an excellent job keeping me informed on the loan status.  There action to assure all documents were collected and checked was very professional.  The available webinar's were also useful to calm fears.Outstanding!!,5
Good customer service.,Lendio was great to work with. The process was very smooth and seamless. I would recommend them to anyone. Thanks Lendio!!,5
Very happy 😃 with your business!,Started the ppp process when it first opened and to say the least everything has been pretty easy. The communication is not so much. I was provided a SBA number a week ago and no communication after that. I’ve called a few times and was told today they sent docusign contract but email address was invalid. No one has reached out to me to inform me. I’ve gotten other emails from them with out a problem. Not sure how much longer I’ll have to wait before they resend or even let me know that they’re resending.Lendio has redeemed themselves. After leaving a review the communication had changed. I was able to speak with my funding rep and she even followed up with me up until the money was in my account.,5
Cannot be reached,"I applied for a PPP forgivable loan thru Lendio on January 25, 2021. Had no idea who they were until I found them via an internet search for PPP. The application process was completely online. Very intuitive. But quickly hit a bump in the road when they followed up the next day asking for information I had already provided via document upload along with the application. I listed my submitted docs and asked them to review and let me know if they needed anything else. Then I received a message asking for 941 reports to verify payroll info. I replied, pointing out I am an independent contractor with no employees on any payroll. Next I received a request for W-2s to verify my income. I replied, again pointing out I am an independent contractor and independent contractors receive 1099s not W-2s because they are not employees of anyone. Finally got a reply saying thanks they had everything they needed.Does this sound like a disaster? NOT AT ALL. Yes I was mildly irritated because I had clearly indicated I was an independent contractor on my application. But on the other side of the desk I can see how Lendio is probably laboring under a ton of applications and needing to be careful before sending out thousands of dollars to someone they would never see. Not to mention doing everything via internet and email can easily lead to brief miscommunication/misunderstanding. On February 12 I received a congratulatory message saying I had been assigned an SBA loan number. Then the same day received loan docs for electronic signature. Today February 18, a short 24 days after submitting my online application, PPP funds were electronially deposited to my account.Thinking about the PPP? It's obviously an individual business decision but I'm proof that the guys and girls at Lendio are the real deal.",4
Quick and efficient!!!!,"Lendio did it, we were funded for our PPP loan!  Although there were quite a few requests to submit documents, they made sure they got the right kind of documents for our business set up, and were very friendly and helpful along the way.  Thanks Lendio!",5

I was always updated as to where my application was in the process, informed about the different lenders and options, and my best possible options. Cody went above and beyond to provide the best service possible!",5
The only reason I gave two stars is…,Customer service and business model for funding time frames are poor and inaccurate.Update 03/01/2021: I still have not received any nor have I been able to receive a proper response from any VP on the SBA government Lending team at Customers Bank. Can someone from the executive board please reach out to assist. We are a small veteran own business try to survive in uncertain times.,2

Our account manager Paige walked us through any difficulties we had with documents. Once they were all correct, Heh Presto, we were approved and funded within a few days.",5
It was good but wasn’t happy that email…,No communication. Submitted PPP application on 01/31/2021 and SBA approved on 2/1/2021.17 days later nothing. Absolutely nothing. Victor will not answer emails says I was at funding desk on 2/11/2021. Legacy bank is lender. Very disappointed. Will not recommend.The response from Lendio for my post is what they always say when they do respond but never respond with any info.***02/19/2021***Still nothing. I have reached out to these everyday since they were issued a SBA number for my PPP loan. NOTHING EXCEPT THE SAME RESPONSE.WAIT FOE EMAIL. THE WORST!!!!WHOMEVER IS LEAVING 5 STAR REVIEWS IS FAKE!!!,3
I applied for PPP loan and had technical problems,THANK YOU FOR ASSISTING US IN THIS TIME OF NEEDS.  WE APPRECIATE YOUR SERVICE.,3
2nd PPP Loan,"Lendio was excellent. The representatives who helped me the most were Melissa Hathaway and Mariah Pew, who were both very professional, insightful and knowledgeable.

Excellent service,"Amazing company and staff.  I was able to get a first round of PPP funding after applying with 4 different lenders (with Wells Fargo, my bank being the least responsive, helpful and most difficult to work with), Lendio got it done!  Even better I was able to get the second round of PPP funding more easily because they had kept a lot of my information!  Agents were responsive and prompt!  Don't go anywhere else - Lendio is the best!",5

Amazing and super efficient!,Awesome customer care and attention to every detail. Top notch. Sam was such a huge help!!,5
Extremely easy and fast process,Great job. Quick,5
The process was fairly quick and easy,Very responsible through all processing,4
Very Satisfied,"I applied for PPP loan with other institutions: Blue Vine and Smart Biz. Their process was confusing and there was nobody to help. I had to be on the phone hours with Blue Vine just to get someone to talk to. I came across Lendio just by doing an online search and I filled out an online application. What made my experience different: I had a point of contact, Caylee, who was available to answer my questions. I was able to speak to a person when I called customer service and it didn't take me hours. I was told right away who the lender was and I contacted the lender for follow up. Caylee reviewed my application and sent me a text asking me to provide my ID. I texted a photo of my ID to her and she uploaded it for me to the application. I think that online instructions could have been more clear, but: overall, Lendio provided better service than other places I have dealt with. The availability of humans made the difference for me as I am not a computer person. I think the availability of real people to answer questions is what sets Lendio apart from others. I didn't feel like it was a factory that just processes and stamps papers. Thank you for the human touch.",5
iT WAS OVERALL GOOD EXPERIANCE GETTING…,"Everything went very well the process was as smooth as any transaction with the Government can be I was concerned that it took 14 days to fund the loan after I signed the note, but the money is in the account now and I am very glad thanks",5
Excellent service,They are very good with finding lenders to meet your criteria.  They really cared about finding funding for my business,5
The process was quick and easy,"clear, easy to follow guidelines.  Gil",5
generally well,Points of contact changing continuously.  The exact same data being requested over and over. Emails coming across with single sentence with no context.  Completely disorganized process.,4
Rapid way to get PPP for my small business,They help me through every step to receive my loan,5
Lendio was great and made me feel that…,"I applied for the second round of PPP through Lendio after my bank opted not to process round 2 loans. So far the experience has been terrible. From minor things like website issues to major things like getting a denial letter for reasons that made no sense that was later deemed a mistake. Now I’m in loan purgatory having attempted to follow up with my loan admin 6 times. They’ve lowered the loan amount inexplicably, but without informing me. I’m trying to get it reviewed but all I get is “someone will call you” which has yet to actually happen despite having followed up 3 times. I’m shocked this is how they treat clients let alone small business who are depending on this relief to survive the pandemic. I’m nervous that I might not get the loan due to their incompetence even though I applied on the very first day it was open to second draw businesses.",5
Excellent work I am very happy  with the work you did 5 stars,The process to obtain a 2nd PPP loan for me was very simple and straightforward. I would definitely do business with Lendio again!,5
Awesome Job!!,this process was easy and seamless thank you so much,5
Excellent Service,Your excellent services is very uplifting to the small business community. Thanks.,5
Great,"Got the idea to use Lendio from ""The Hartford"" I clicked through filled out all the data and submitted...nothing....then I was told I needed to send documents that I had already sent. Every day up to 3x a day I got an email sent saying my application was incomplete. When I would log on...it said ""complete."" There was noone to reach out to. Then finally I got a call from a Joenathan.He asked me to upload further information...I dont know why....then silence...no emails as promised or updates on the site...still the same your application needs attention. Then out of the blue, I got a text and he said I was eligible for double what I put down and would he like me to adjust my figures. I said yes and then silence. 3 days later my application had again been reset. Online person said my figures were wrong so I completed the application again. Joenathan was nowhere to be found. I emailed, called and texted...nothing. Now I was exasperated and my bank decided to start offering so  I was going to drop Lendio. I told the online person how frustrated I have been with the whole process. Finally it moved to approved by the SBA so I was stuck...then I waited for the paperwork which came. This whole process has taken me over 6 weeks. Time to complete form and submit has been an hour. One of the worst experiences I have had. Further...no way to respond to the reply from Lendio they dont acknowedge the bugs in their system nor the fact their agents dont answer you back. Its a one way street. Yes I finally got the money but since I was tied into the situation there was little else I could do but follow it through. In short...it was a mess...if you like messes go right ahead and apply with them but if you think they are a partner...think again",5
Great service,"I discovered Lendio when I applied for my first PPP Loan. Although, I had a banking relationship with a major bank, and even though I applied for the first PPP loan as soon as it opened, my bank was not able to get the loan for OCA. Instead, they took care of their bigger customers first and even though OCA applied in a timely fashion, we did not get the loan. As a backup, I wet to Lendio and to my surprise, Lendio came through for us. The staff was very helpful and provided explanations and guidance on how to apply for the loan. For our PPP2 application, it was easy to go back to Lendio and that process was smooth as well.Keep up the good work !!!",5
I tried to reach you after 10 days…,Easy online process. Accessible help and information. Fast funding. I'm very pleased with the service provided. Would recommend Lendio. Thanks,2
Great service and quick response.,Follow up! Again Lendio. Is requiring a 2020 draft  for tax returns. If you haven't filed your 2020 tax returns in February then you are out of luck. Non of this was required when submitted your application. They are holding applications and your SBA # to make you file your returns early than you anticipated to. I submitted my first app in early January. They are a joke. Making rules as they go.,5
"PPP Loan success, finally",Lending reps were very helpful in helping my small business stay afloat in these trying times.  It is greatly appreciated!,4
You guys did great.,Very easy to work with and very friendly. Even the person I chatted with was awesome . Definitely recommend,5
Very good service,The process of applying was super easy.,5
Inept and unresponsive support,"Overall it was a good experience and Lendio successfully processed my application and got me the loan. They answered the phone the first time I called (which was quite a surprise), and were very helpful. My only criticism would be that, after that, I feel the communication of where my application was deficient could have been offered. I never again got a return call when I had questions, and this made me question what was going on with my application. Well, what was going on is they were getting it approved and not holding my hand. Thanks Lendio.",2
You are excellent,Very helpful lady. Ty,5
Good communication throughout the…,Lendio has been great.  They get back to me and answer my questions.  I applied at 2 places.  With Lendio I already have recieved my PPP loan.  My regular bank has not even even reviewed my initial PPP application yet.  Thank you Lendio!,5

Lendio is very efficient with working…,Lendio was the first organization to open enrollment which was a big plus given the importance of securing our place in line.  Requirements were more involved they the first PPP loan but the support I received from Customer Service saved the day.  This is a big deal for our small dessert shop and the funds will give us a fighting chance to make it.  Now finger crossed we’re not forced to pay $15 hour for labor on summer jobs to high school students.,5
I applied for pp and it was 2 months…,just wanted to say thank u to craig for all of his patience and time helping me get through this process he helped me with my not so technical mind and not so computer savy,3

Lendido did a great job,Easy to comprehend with much follow through,5
Our experience with Lendio was great…,It was a 5 starts experience for me and for our business with 19 employees. The application for a PPP 2 was easy to submit and the Loan process took less than 2 weeks with the actual funds arrived to my business account. Easy and clear communication regarding additional required information. Each email from Lendio came with the proper working links and with the name of the person and contact information in case I would need to make a phone call.,4

They will make sure u get ur money..I'm…,Lendio got us our PPP loan - At times the process was haphazard and it seemed like our Rep changed daily.  Possibly because the volume of loans they are processing.  In the end they came through for us.,5
Quick response and steady follow up,For the most part the process went smoothly. I would have given 5 stars but I am still awaiting funding. I do believe lendio is a great platform for expedited small business funding especially in these unprecedented times. I was helped through the process every step of the way. Thank you so much!,5

Responsive and Supportive,Very Helpful!,5
Lendio PPP…,"I had followed the Lendio PPP application instructions exactly as it was, but I received at least five generic email messages asking me to add additional documents by following the application and document upload procedures. I said these were generic email messages because though the representatives were different every time, they were just stating the same meaningless and unhelpful messages about there were not enough documents submitted. None but Enjoli Burnette was being specific about providing a weblink to submit a few bank and business licensing documents which were not being required during the PPP application process. After Enjoli Burnette, there were at least a couple more Lendio agents repeating the same annoying and confusing email messages about missing documents.Therefore, the application process and instructions were not accurate and were insufficient. Adding to that, those few email messages from the few Lendio agents had only created more time wasting confusions.The whole PPP application experience was erroneous and below par. Lendio was using too many representative that were there just to clock their work hours but were not being productive like Enjoli Burnette – sending time wasting / erroneous / generic email messages without any follow up.Through the assistance of Enjoli Burnette alone, I finally got my PPP loan.Thank you.Yang Pan",5
Second Draw PPP,Update 4 Stars: Landen called. Said I am 98% through the process for sure. Getting an email or a call is always better than no communication at all. If this part can be resolved this would be a 5 star process. The only issue anyone has is the lack of communication. Here is how my process went: Feb 1st. AppliedFeb 2nd. Approved by SBA and given a loan numberFeb 9th . Signed loan docsFeb 12. Loan docs sent to bank Feb 15th. Signed loan docs for the second timeFeb 16th. Funded 1st post 1 Star: No communication. Not bad communication.,5
My only comment would be regarding your…,Communication was sparse and rife with issues that contradicted each other. I finally got the funds but after weeks of confusing emails and docusign pages.,4
Great service,"My experience hasn't been all that smooth and hunky dory as indicated by my five star rating. I had to go through several iterations of changes to my application, which involved actions like from revision to the requested amount to multitude of resubmissions of multiple supporting documents. Finally, though, the funding that my loan got approved for was about the same that I had requested initially. Lendio paid serious attention during the entire process to our loan request to get us eventually funded through one of their lenders in time to help us keep our payroll running. That's the reason for the five star rating! Oh by the way, I also learnt that Lendio is a marketplace and not the institute that provides funding. They broker between the loan requester and the funding institute. The process will make a lot more sense if you keep that in mind.",5
Great customer service,Great customer service! Great experience!,5
Lendio Review,Worked smoothly. Only thing was that I wasn't able to get email responses - but understandable considering the amount of applications.,5

Very good,"I heard of Lendio through my book keeper and was getting nowhere with my banks online application. The Lendio online application was much easier to use and didn't have as many glitches. When I did have problems or was unclear of what was needed from me, there was a questions box that helped to steer me through the process. I finished the application and was funded 10 days later.",5
The staff is completely professional…,"Overall a great service and easy to work with. The only suggestion I could make would be to offer a list of all the documents required before starting the application. After each page of the application, I had to search and generate documents that I did not have on hand. Multiple emails from Lendio and my lender that was selected for me, were confusing with all the scams out there today.",5

Great automated user friendly service,"After trying 3 other options for PPP, Lendio got it done! Great communication from the Lendio team. It was surprising and very much welcomed to actually talk to a live dedicated rep. Instead of just submitting documents and not knowing what was right. Thank you Lendio!!",5
Took longer,Great service. Great people. Rocky Christensen was doing his part and way way beyond to help me find the product that allowed me to accomplish what i was looking for: my time was short and even with that factor he could found the money to fund my deal. He was in touch with me constantly and took care of my goal. Thank you 😊,4
Easy and simple,Incredibly excellent service and kindness people!Smooth and fast! I appreciate for your precious time!,5
U were perfect team and I am grateful…,"I got my PPP loan approved and funded in about 4 weeks. So I'm happy that the loan eventually got approved. However, there were times when I had questions about whether the correct documents had been submitted. However, Lendio did a poor job of communicating with me. Many emails went unanswered and when I called, Lendio reps were pretty dismissive and patronizing. Don't disrespect your customers Lendio and don't ghost people when questions are being asked.",5
Good,"The service was amazing! For being such a stressful time for small business owners, the Lendio portal was very easy and straightforward. For follow ups, the chat feature was so helpful! I was so impressed and grateful!",5
Quick to respond,"After submitting all the proper paperwork, I continued to get emails and text that they needed the paperwork that I had uploaded. Then I got paperwork to close on the loan, which was signed and submitted. Then continued to get emails to resubmit all the paperwork I had uploaded. Then got emails telling me I was funded but DID NOT GET THE MONEY, Very concerned and no one seems to call back with any information to assist or clarify",5
Very professional and make the process…,"Very satisfied, very professional they follow up every step to make it happen, best decision ever.Thank you!",5
Great service,Very impressed with my experience with Lendio. I was skeptical at first but they came through and got me what i needed extremely quickly. Thank you again!,5
Lendio was helpful every step of the…,"Lendio did a great job during difficult circumstances. I applaud every person on their team who worked tirelessly (nights and weekends) to assure that my application was approved. Despite the fact that the application was not perfect. It did not fit my business model—a sole proprietor of an LLC with no employees—it wanted me to provide payroll tax forms. In desperation, I called my CPA and was told ""No! you do not have those forms, you DID NOT HAVE PAYROLL."" My trusty Lift Fund guy, Adrian Gonzales, said, take out your EIN number and replace it with your social security number and I think I can make this fly. And he DID! Unlike our former president, I paid $27,000 in taxes for my gross earnings of $300,000 in 2019. In 2020, I earned a grand total of $1,000. Thank you for keeping me alive!!!",5

I've been strung along for a few weeks, communication has been terrible, and the only time  I can actually reach anybody for any update is by harassing them with phone calls until they eventually answer.  Funding managers don't return emails aland rarely voicemails.  Each time it's been a new funding manager who is even more clueless than the previous.They're asking me to review them before they've even saw to it that my account was actually funded.  It was approved by the SBA 2 weeks ago and still not funding.  That's seems very typical of something they would do, so here's your 1 start review.  You sure earned it.I regret using Lendio.",5
Great & fast Service,Lendio’s ppp process was fast and easy.  I submitted my paperwork and within 24 hours i had a lender.,5

Professional. Efficient. Done. Thank You.,Although the process & navigating the website  was a bit inconveniencing & hectic I can say it was ALL worth it. I was finally approved & received my funds within a week of signing loan documents. Probably would’ve received sooner if I’d known I hadn’t already uploaded a voided check. Thanks Lendio & I’ll definitely recommend you’ll to others!Thanks,5
Excellent service,"Everybody at Lendio made the process as pain free as possible. The representatives were extremely cordial and helpful, even calling me back upon seeing missed calls to them. Their website is clear and intuitive and is a simple means to check on the status of applications. Finally all said and done we received the PPP loan we engaged Lendio for. Thanks to them. They really have a lot of things figured out and humming along!",5

Loan reps contact you and make sure everything is submitted correctly to ensure you are fully funded!!! I definitely recommend you get you PPP through Lendio,4
Super fast and very professional,Well so far my experience has been terrible with Lendio.  Seemed like a good idea.  One application that goes out to a whole lot of lenders for our PPP loan.  Well in 3.5 weeks we have had 4 different loan managers and NOBODY responds to e-mails or phone calls.  I read all of the rave reviews and thing they must be fake given my terrible experience.,5
Excellent,The staff was very helpful with the completion of my application. They also let me know that I actually qualified for more than I requested. The end results I got what I needed to stay in business. Thank you!,5

Excellent service,Lendio bank did great job and did my loan sanctioned. I appreciate and thank you,5
Great job from start to finish,I applied for a PPP loan with Lendio.  They sat on my application for three weeks and asked for the same documents five times.  I uploaded them each time from my payroll processing company and they just could not figure out how to process the application of a business that uses a PEO.  What a waste of time and effort.,5
The Lendio team was helpful and on…,"We have been trying for months to submit and upload many documents pertaining to our PPP application.  I was so lucky to have been contacted by Luis Jimenez on Wed., 2/10/21, who with his help and patience and kindness I was finally at the finish line.

I was asked for a report that does not apply to me and with that being the last request, I am not sure if my application is being worked on or wondering if I should go elsewhere. I went to check the status of my process and I cannot see any of the documents I uploaded. I only wish I could speak to someone and find out what is going on. Our business needs the money so very much and if I just knew what was happening and it was accurate would be great.",5
Very helpful in every aspect and…,"I did get the PPP money but the process and the communication was challenging. However, I was contacted by a manager and he apologized for the process which showed me that they really do care. They have a lot of loans they are working on so be aware of this. At the end of the day, I got the PPP and that’s what really matters.",5
The process was seamless and simple,"Lendio is HORRIBLE to deal with. I will give examples.   First we applied for second draw last week in January and we are still waiting,6 different people have texted us for information, the exact same information, these 6 people do not answer their phones or texts, they sent us texts at 130 in the morning, they kept demanding documents that were not needed,the last person we were texting was Daniel Flowers at Lendio, once we started questioning him after talking to our tax preparer and SBA he has cut his phone off and will not respond.We don’t know how much money was requested for funding, we don’t know where our information is,  we don’t even know if our application has actually been sent to funding,and l could keep going on. We have reached out to the Lendio liasion. Will update",5
PPP loan application went thorough…,Thank You ALL @ Lendio for helping & guiding me & being so patient with me as I had a small issue (on my end) uploading a document. Lendio came highly recommended by a friend of mine & now I got see why. Thank you again!,5

Nomura Sushi,"I'm giving 4 stars only because I consider 5 stars to be perfect and it wasn't a perfect experience. That being said it was very good and I did eventually get my 2nd draw PPP loan in 28 days from application to deposit in my bank account.My main complaint was communication. I had emails and texts back and forth with 5 different point people before I was through with the process and this made me feel at times as though I didn't know who was actually handling my application and at what stage it was at. I know the company was probably swamped with lots of businesses applying and that's probably why, so I don't really hold that against them. Hopefully the forgiveness part of the loan will be a smoother process when we get to that point.",5
Not great communication,Ms. Ruiz was very nice in calling and emailing me and advising methat I was just missing one document which I  emailed to her.,2
Quick and good,"My company was overall extremely pleased with the efficiency and timelines with regards to Lendio. Thank you for that! Although I gave you 5 stars, there is one thing I would like to have seen done differently and that was communication.... My only recommendation is with regards to the communication piece. I received several emails with different individuals stating they were our representative however could never get a hold of anyone. Once I received the Loan documents, I signed them and didn’t hear anything for a week. No guidance on if this was the final step and if so, when we would receive the funds. We received them within a week (which was fantastic) we just wish were told a timeline. When your business is navigating through a pandemic, having all information is crucial. There was one representative; Jaime Rogers who needed some documentation from me. She did answer my call and provided me with any information she had. She was hired as a temp so she wasn’t very versed on the timelines but she did her best.As said above, overall, the experience was great. I would recommend Lendio to anyone moving forward.",5
Lendio was super easy to use for my PPP…,Hello I applied with Lendio for the first time and I actually didn't have a problem. I was a bit nervous at first because I wasn't sure if I was doing the PPP loan correctly but you just have to read all the questions slowly and make sure you have all you paperwork on file.Customer service was prompt and fast to respond to my questions and concerns. I hope you will get to talk to Janda she is a good listener and she will help you through the process if you feel lost. She is knowledgeable and she will get you the answers you need. Good luck to everyone and thank you Lendio for your services!,5
They were awesome,"Overall, I find the services to be excellent.  I am pleased and grateful for our PPP relationship with Lendio and I will sing your praises in any way I can.  I do have one piece of the process that I find cumbersome.  I get lots of emails from Lendio about PPP that are not relevant to where I am in the process.  This caused confusion so many times.  For instance, even though we've been funded in the second round, I am getting emails from your team introducing themselves as my PPP contact and asking me to review my application.  I feel like this needs to be cleaned up.  It weren't for this, I'd give you a 5 start rating.",5
Exactly the help we needed,"I applied For ppp. They switched my funding manager, 5 times before it was approved. Every time i emailed And never could get through on the phone. The chat feature was only way to contact anyone. I applied Back in august and just got funded in February. I would Try multiple different lender",5
The best app ever,Lendio made applying for the PPP federal program very simple. I can’t imagine not considering Lendio for future funding projects!,5

Simple and easy,"Lendio was so helpful with the first and second round of PPP loans. There were a couple of really helpful online live information sessions before the applications were even available, which were so informative, and the opportunity to update existing information ahead of time, which made the actual application a breeze when it became available. The Lendio dashboard also let us know where our application was in the process of being reviewed then a lender chosen. I made a mistake on my application with the loan number for the first round, and Lendio asked for me to fix it -- I was concerned we would then be at the back of the line. But as it turned out, we were funded the next week. They were extremely helpful. Thank you.",5
AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE,Could not have asked for a more smooth and easy PPP application process. I love that they connected me with a dedicated rep in my area who was available to answer questions. Amazing service!!!,1
Easy application,"Great Service, followed up on things that would have slipped through the cracks at other lenders. Extra surprising due to the incredible volume of applications they were dealing with for the PPP #2 applications.",5
I couldn't get this done through Bank…,On line application was easy to use and they were available by phone when needed,5
Very helpful and friendly,"Very patient with the process, and it was done quickly !",5
Lendio Works,"I initially tried to apply for a second draw PPP thru  my 2 business banks but got denied because somehow I didn’t qualify. I was pretty frustrated and surprised that the banks I hold business accounts with just dropped me like that.Lendio was recommended by a friend so I applied and in a few days I got an SBA loan number and a couple of days later, received my funds. Applying thru Lendio was a quick and easy process. I was really surprised by how fast I got my funds!I highly recommend Lendio.",5
Jamine was really attentive and…,I received my first ppp loan from lendio - they were so quick to get everything taken care of.  They also had an extremely helpful webinar for questions concerning the second ppp loan.,5
Just the best in the industry.,"Lendio was very organized and efficient in the process. Their on-line application portal was easy to navigate, with customer service representatives available via chat in real time. And the turnaround time from start to finish was very short. Thanks, Lendio, for all your support!",5
Absolutely Pathetic,They were very helpful and responsive throughout the entire process,1
Everything went relatively well,"Quick, easy to use service that has excellent customer service!!!",4
Lendio made this whole process SO EASY!,I’d recommend using Lendio. They were able to get my PPP loan approved quickly. The staff was friendly and kept me up to date throughout the process. 5 stars!!!,5
It was quick and accurate.,"I wanted to applied for the first round of the PPP but unfortunately my bank was no longer taking applications.  It took some time and searching but I finally found Lendio and from the start I was presented with hope.  When the first round was terminated I was told not to ""despair"" for there was a good chance that a second round would surface.  It did, and Lendio got the job done.  You can't ask for more than perseverance in your vendors!  Thanks Lendio.",4
Very helpful and friendly.,Lendio was easy and professional to work with. In this interesting time we need quick and easy.,5
Great solution for lending!!,"Nobody to talk to. Tried many times to talk to someone but no reply. I applied with 2 banks to be safe. One cleared under writing and was submitted to SBA, only to rejected because Lendio submitted to SBA without doing underwriting or anything else. I have spent so much time trying to contact someone but don’t hear back. I can’t apply anywhere else because they got an SBA number. Applying with Lendio was a huge mistake.",5
Lendio did an excellent job in getting…,Bill has been nice to work with. My personal experience was a few expected false starts out of the gate followed by a reservation number and final documents signed 21 days ago. No funding as of yet. Had better experience with US Bank on first round.,5
The process was made easy by your…,Very Helpful in a hard time.,5
Great,Excellent service. I pursued PPP through 3 vendors and Lendio was the only one who was able to get us funded. I highly recommend them. 5 stars!,5
keep up the good work!,"Excellent customer service with results.John Fee with Lendio in Erie, PA provides excellent customer service & offers services with desired results. Easy to work with, answered all of my questions and was able to achieve what I requested.",5
They did an excellent job securing the…,It’s always nice to have a business with high quality professionals . Thanks Lendio!,5
Fast fast and fast,Very easy process. Good communication by email and text. Would definitely work with again!,5
Great communication and incredibly fast…,"Our rep with Lendio, Sam, was fantastic.  He was patient and kind all the way.  I know I pestered him sometimes about things he couldn't really answer but he provided words of encouragement that really helped ease the anxiety.  We have full loyalty to Sam.  Thanks for such fantastic job!",5
Easy Process for 2nd PPP Loan,"Submitted January 14, 2021 funded on Feb 11, 2021. This is with the issues with new guidance from the SBA. You'll need to follow up manually but they are good people!",4
Working with Lendio was an excellent…,"I normally deal with American Express but since they referred me to Lendio, I thought to give it a try. I mean, Amex putting themselves out there for another company “must” mean that they are respected. During my application for the PPP for my business, I see a funding manager at the end of the page with a phone number if I had questions. I called 3 different people and none of them answered my call or returned my message. The chat box was even hard to get a response. I would ask a question and on some occasions wait 10 minutes for a response and still not answering the question that I asked.  Today, I’m waiting for the SBA Loan to be deposited into my business which hasn’t arrived yet and today makes day number 9 from date of receiving my SBA Loan number. I hope I don’t encounter any problems tomorrow which is the 10th day because I know that I’ll have even more problems trying to speak to someone from Lendio. Oh, and I’m still waiting for return calls and responses. I hope this helps you.",5
5stars,"I finally received a call from someone at Lendio who answered my simple question. I understand it's busy with the PPP going on.  However I didn't like the initial response, but Joe was very nice and answered all my questions. He actually called me at 8pm and will follow up with me in a couple few days to make sure everything is going through.  Thank you JoeUpdate i received the funds late Friday night. Called Joe and let him know on Sat. Thank you again Joe.",5
Great,Quick process. But it’s been 5 days since I’ve signed the documents and sent a voided check. Still no funds,5
Easy Process,The initial process was pretty easy but I signed documents 10 days ago and my loan has still not funded. I was told it could take up to 10 business days. This is unacceptable.  Update. I did receive funds the night I posted this review. I received a call from Lending explaining the reason it took so long...and then asked me to update my review.,5
Great job!,Overall I can't rate my experience yet because I am still in the process but I applied on January 13th I believe and since than not much has happened. Recently a few weeks ago my dashboard stated my application was approved thru Ready Capital and I was assigned a spa loan number. I have not heard a word from a rep or received anything communication since. My funding managers keep changing and I have written all of them without any response.  I am starting to wonder now because of the lack of communication if my loan will even be funded.,5
Initially everything went smooth,"I submitted to Lendio on January 27, 2021. Initially I would have said great. That's because I didn't need assistance.  I have sent emails to my ever changing fund managers to no avail.  Simple questions zero response. Then a customer service representative sent me an email regurgitating the PPP program as if they themselves were totally automated.  Questions still unanswered. I know SBA provided a number and my questions were relevant to my other applications.  No help at all.  I am a very small business so I don't rate a response.  The worst service ever. If you have a higher amount I am sure they will fall over you!! Not the little guy, who they claim to be in exists to help. UPDATE I was contacted from another company where I also submitted an application.  They informed me they could not proceed until I pulled my application from Lendio.  I attempted to contact three different avenues 1. Chat, the response was ""oops no one responded. We have your email if we need to contact you.  2. I emailed my funding manager. 3. I called my funding manager.  Within that time frame, a real person from the other company emailed me three times. If I could give Lendio a negative rating I would.  I know this is difficult and everyone is working.  However,  I keep getting emails from Lendio about applying for the PPP ads. They don't need to advertise to get additional business when they are not providing any support for current customers.It is a shame it's only here I get a response and it is incorrect.  The lender has 10 calendar days. If it falls on a weekend the following business day. Please, check your facts. Update I was contacted by Landon from the customer experience department of Lendio. He provided updated information on my PPP loan and  explained the delay.  He apologized for the lack of communication. Landon was knowledgeable and very helpful.",1
It was a very easy and tech friendly…,"An agent kept calling and texting for more and more information, and she could barely speak English...I could hardly understand her English at all.  I speak 7 languages, so I'm used to accents.",5
Great job,"Overall, the LENDIO on-line application for PPP (Round 2) was an excellent experience.  It was easy to navigate their website, and ""drag & upload"" documents (bank statements, business tax returns, etc.), and submit this application.  LENDIO processed this application very quickly.  There was an occasional ""confusing"" e-mail (eg. ""Apply now"" AFTER I had applied, or ""Check your application on-line"" AFTER my application was already complete). Overall, I'd HIGHLY recommend LENDIO, and THANK YOU LENDIO for assistance with this important PPP loan !!",5
I am having trouble with lendio,Lendio thank you for helping our family save our 2 restaurants. If it wasn't for the PPP loan we would it have to close permanently. Thank you for keeping our American Dream alive. Ever grateful you guy's are awesome. You Rock.,1

Lendio did a great job and Thank you…,A special thanks to a Mr Paul Harris a manager at your Woodbury NY location--without his assistance we would not have received our PPP funds.He does not even work in the PPP dept but when he heard that I needed help as I was walking thru his building he volunteered to make some calls to make sure I would get on the right track.Every one needs more people like Mr. Harris.,5

Some body dropped the ball on my…,Lendio provided excellent assistance in facilitating my PPP loan. They connected me with BlueVine as they were familiar with PPP loans for Independent Contractors. I was able to reach out to Traci Halky with Lendio for personalized questions and assistance. I will be forever grateful for their expertise during difficult times.,4

It’s easy and convenient,The best PPP lender with amazing service.,5
Very good services,Excellent customer response time. Skilled and informed bankers to help with the process.,5
Overall a good experience,Thanks Lendio for helping me get both rounds of PPP.  The first round I was shocked at how you were able to communicate effectively and help me through the process with REady Capital.  You did an excellent job communicating to so we were all ready to apply for the second round and you did a lot to offer customer service when we had issues.  thanks again!,4
Lendio delivered for us.,Easy to use and most importantly they follow up with you frequently.,5
Very easy and quick process,"Lendio was the only one that came through for me re the PPP loans as a small business!(First round I applied through 6 lenders, and all other lenders were awful,with no clue if anything was working, and I'm very good at these kind of things.)I would love to give Lendio 5 stars because I'm a true believer,and I am still singing their praises,but I have to be honest-the number one problem is that they are servicing so many applicants that they don't respond to phone calls or emails when you have an issue that,if it were answered directly, you wld get all your documents in correctly quickly, but remember they are head and shoulders above other lenders (unless you are a big business and can get a private banker to help). They have a good portal and helpful tools.",5
Thanks for your support in this process…,"PPP applicationI started my PPP application with Lendio, midway through the app they diverted me to their partner Bluevine, which kind of surprised me, but before other banks even acknowledged my application Bluevine had me approved! My experience was great, and they were lighting fast, I literally went from application to funds in my account in 5 business days",5
I saw a podcast of lendio on YouTube…,Lendio was very helpful during the entire process for the PPP second draw application. Easy and efficient turnaround.,4
Pretty painless easy process,"Last year I applied with Key Bank, it was an utter disaster. The loan process was archaic, lacked assistance and the loan was funded, only to be denied by the bank  due to the nature of my business. With Lendio the application was a breeze and was easy to do. In actuality it took less than 30 minutes to complete.  My experience with Key Bank: I spent hours trying understand the instructions and weeks trying to input the information into their format. The most honest experience I can share with you was this. After finishing Lendio’ application, I hysterically started to laugh aloud in complete disbelief that I was done. It’s the real deal!",5
Lendio was very professional and got my…,"Although the cost of the loan and interest seemed expensive, the process of getting a loan was relatively quick and easy.  Getting funded lagged a couple of days, but was faster than most lenders I've experienced, generally speaking.  The first couple of daily payments have gone smoothly, although my specific loan terms are different than what I would assume others would receive. The broker I spoke with was friendly, easy to talk with, and good at identifying the best way to solve the problem. I'll update my rating in 8 months after the loan is repaid regarding the entire process.",5
Lendio = Losses,quick and simple..Got my PPP loan quickly,3
Good,I had an excellent experience. I was amazed by how efficient and responsive Lendio was. Very impressive!,5
Clarify process,"Lendio was easy to work with, took the time to get to know our business and very responsive to our needs. They delivered on what they said they would -   I would highly recommend them to any small business.",4
Awesome Service,"My ""case manager"", or whatever they are called was changed multiple times. Zero contact phone numbers worked for anyone. Zero emails or texts were returned and I was never contacted by anyone despite consistently reaching out to have questions answered...questions I still have. I also kept receiving texts and emails that my application was incomplete (it wasn't) and that I needed to hurry because the funds would run out soon.  Despite all these emails and texts, absolutely no one answered my calls or emails. I'm still not sure whats going on. I received an SBA loan number and signed loan docs on 1/27....I still haven't received funds and I still have questions.  I never write negative reviews for any company, but this needed to be said.",4
Fast and easy,"I highly recommend Lendio. I contacted my bank during Covid and they were not cooperative. I have excellent credit.  My accountant recommended Lendio and, to be honest, the process was so fast I thought it was too good to be true.  Lendio's follow up and communication is second to none.",5

Fast and Efficient!,"I’ve had my application with lendio ready to go since the last distribution of ppp funds in june. Numerous times, the system told me the application was complete and ready for submission with SBA. for some reason Colleen Cunningham was not able to process it ... she repeatedly kept asking me to download the same documents over and over and finally in NOVEMBER when I voiced my frustration to her , she threatened to pull my application. She decided playing a game with me was funny to her, instead of helping and giving guidance as her collegues do. Numerous times I reached out asking what she specifically needed and every reply was a rude and snarky remark and did not answer the question or just request the same documents that were already in the system. miraculously, Sonny my liason for this round was able to get me approved within 2 wks . I’m thankful for that , however from June till now was Far more stressful than I needed it to beI’ve been in business for 35yrs and am a creative business woman, which is why My child care center is still standing today.  Lendio is only as good as it’s “knowledgeable “ employees. Colleen Cunningham is clearly incompetent at her job, is burnt out and a threat to all small businesses seeking help and guidance. She should be removed from her role immediately.",5
We had a great experience with Lendio,Trust is the word that comes to mind when i think of Lendio. Their team makes you feel important throughout the entire process. Colleen did exactly what she said she would do and gave me confidence we would get the help we needed for our business.,5
Lendio was prompt,Responsive company with a personal touch.,5
Easy process went great!,A friend of mine recommended Lendio .I couldn’t believe how easy and stress free the whole process was ...look forward to working with lendio in the future...Thank you Nick,5
There was a glitch in the system that…,Still waiting for them to help fix my application. I keep on updating it and it doesn’t update. I’ve called and no one has been there to help,4
Super simple and streamlined process,My Lendio advisor Karel went above and beyond to help me get this deal done.,5
Great experience,"The experience was nice on the first day with the filing of the additional paperwork. After the first day we have not been able to get any communication with Lendio. They have verified acceptance of all their required documentation. And since we haven't gotten an email or a call, and can't get through on any of the numbers they gave us. We are a profitable, vetted, small business, in need of these funds dearly. We are veteran owned. We qualify for the loan, we kindly ask someone to look into our file. That was weeks ago. Help?",5
Excellent Service,I love that they used Calendly to set up an appointment. No back-n-forth with email or voice messages. Caleb was extremely patient and helpful. He answered all my questions and walked me through the forms. He was knowledgeable of the process AND gave me detailed instructions on what to expect once I submitted my application. Now that's good customer service!,5
Lendio was fast and easy,"Lendio is great!  I used them to procure a PPP loan and was amazed at how efficiently they lined me up with my lender.  The lender had a couple of hiccups, but it wasn't Lendio's fault.  Eventually, though, my loan came through and all is well.",5
The loan application process was fairly…,"(Laura from CX) is the kind of customer service person that I would like working at my company.This morning I went online to Lendio, it appeared that my application was WITHDRAWN. I was disappointed at first but after chatting with Laura she assured me that it was glitch and that she moved my application back into processing. Very very helpful.",5
I couldn't recommend them more! AMAZING,"I worked with Greg Rellaford for both the first and second rounds of PPP, and I cannot say enough good things about him. I felt like he sincerely cared about my well-being, and the health of my business. He went out of his way multiple times to check in with me, both via telephone and email, and it made me feel like I was important and valued. Those are two things that often get lost when you're a small business owner. I so appreciate that he went above and beyond for me and my business. Thank you, Lendio, and thank you especially, Greg!",5
Everything went super smooth,There's so much i can say about the dedication and hard work the Hunter did to help me . at the end of the day THANK YOUand never forget that a satisfy custemor is what keeps up going. I probably will never meet you but i want you to know i will highly recommend you. Thank you again. Vilma D,5
Better than going through my bank!,"After being switched to 2 funding managers, waiting on one document to be verified, Melanie Johnson was a great customer service rep and got everything completed for me to be sent to my lender in 30min. She went above and beyond! Thank you Melanie for all of your help. Thank you Lendio.",5
Everything was good except the applying…,"Chase gave PPP to many large business and my small business kept getting a run around.  Then they ran out of money in round one and we recieved nothing.  In the 2nd round of PPP, I decided to apply at Lendio and Chase.  Lendio got the PPP approved while Chase still shows ""In review"".  Thank you Lendio for helping with a MUCH NEEDED PPP loan to help me keep going.",4
I loved Lendio and,"A fantastic team to work with, they know how to get the job done professionally. I strongly recommend them.",5
The only issue I had and I believe it…,"Submitted docs on 1/8.  After two weeks, changed funding agent on 1/29 and was asked for two additional docs which I provided on that day. Since then my status of gathering all the documents has stayed the same.  I reached out to be told ""It takes time.""  I am a very very small business.  I have four friends who began their application process well after I did.  Each one has been approved and two have already been funded.   I really feel as though because I am a so small, I am being ignored.ADDITION ---Lendio did a terrible job. If anyone is reading this please beware. They put my application through Ready Capital, a company that has the worst ratings on Trustpilot, Reddit, Yelp, etc.  They jerked my case around for weeks, asking of the same documents over and over.   Moreover, they put my sensitive information in another company's portal. There is no way to communicate with them. Lendio took ZERO responsibility. Each agent that I was eventually able to reach told me there was nothing they could do. I started this process on 1/8/21 and her I am two months later and nothing. This is for one employee -- one.Lendio should have their hands slapped for using such a shoddy operation such as Ready Capital. I have gone to the media. If anyone else is interested, post and I will reach out.!",5
Excellent customer service,They asked me to load the same doc over 5 times. Ask me over and over. Wont reply to any of my emails. Should have not wasted my time. Worse experience ever.,5
Easy process,Thelma was very responsive and helpful through the entire process also she showed An Tremendous amount of patience,5
We applied for a loan everything was…,It was relatively easy to upload documents.  The only thing is you should list everything necessary to complete it.  Sometimes it caused a delay in getting you the documents.,5
Process was user friendly and efficient…,Lendio successfully processed 2 rounds of PPP application for us in a timely manner.  Greatly appreciated.,5
They help me successfully applied the…,Great service.  My rep was excellent and helped me very quickly,5
Great service.,"Lendio was there when I could not get a PPP loan from any other bank.  They were attentive, fast, and easy to work with.",5
My experience was quick and easy process,Catherine and her team did an excellent job on our loan,5
Quick Process & Great Customer Service,Lendio was very responsive and quick to process my loan. They were in the middle of training a bunch of new hires to process the 2nd round of PPP loans so the only negative was the inability to answer questions without supervisor intervention but other than that they were great.,5
Thanks for everything excellent service,Lendio made the PPP application process very easy. The communication through the process was awesome!,5
Outstanding customer service,"Seamless process, easy to work with, and great support along the way.",5
Lendio is the best for anyone’s…,Good excellent,5
Overall pretty easy experience,"Our first PPP was thru Bank of America. After submitted, no response and nobody to contact at all. Very frustracted process.Our friend referred us to do second PPP thru Lendio. Totally different experience. The next day, we got response thru email and text to complete everything. And in about two weeks, we got funded.Great job. Thanks Lendio Team",4
My experience was quick and easy.,The PPP process with Lendio was awesome. So very smooth and easy. They came thru when my bank (not for long) Wells Fargo couldn’t help. I have referred lots of people to lendio.,5
smooth process,"Fast And AutomatedThis was a very fast and automated way to process my PPP loan.  It was easy to submit the documents and the system told me what documents to upload.  What they could do better would be to have me answer the questions in advance so they can give me a list of the documents I need to gather.  It took me a couple days to gather the needed documents and I wish I had the docs ready and scanned  so I could have them ready when I actually applied.  As it was, I lost some of my application due to timing out while I searched for the documents.  Also, it was hard to get my questions answered.  The support people really didn't know much.  But all said, it was the fastest loan I've ever applied for and the fastest funding by far.  I never got notification the loan had funded.  I just got the docs to e-sign and a few days later I found the money in my account.  They could communicate a little better as well.",5
Good job,Very efficient process.. good platform.,5
Great!,"Lendio was very helpful, they kept me updated via email on every step of the process. The only reason they lost a star was because the “dashboard” doesn’t seem to get updated as much as it should.",4
Was funded 1/2 my PPP loan,"Thank you so much lendio for being so professional and efficient, all good things to say about Lendio",1
Easy to work with and got us the loan…,"Horrible communication throughout the entire process. Never received an email saying our docs were in order, app was sent to SBA or approved. Never have received a response to numerous emails and phone calls. Website still says ""we are moving it into processing"" even though our loan was funded and we still don't have any information about who the lender is or how to contact them. The only reason I gave two starts is that we did end up receiving our 2nd round PPP (but even then it wasn't for the correct amount based upon our verified payroll).Update 3/17/2021: Still no contact from Lendio or the Lender. No one is answering the Lendio phones and Lender has no listed phone number. We have our money but no way to communicate with the Lender, see statements or anything substantive.",5
amazing!,"I was extremely sketchy about using Lendio, but honestly if I didn't I would be really upset with myself. I applied on January 24th 2021 for the PPP SECOND DRAW and I must say Im extremely happy about the outcome. I applied on the 24th got approved on the 30th and had my SBA loan number by February 1st. Now I'm just waiting on them to fund me. I applied with another company and my application is still on the first step. Smh. The only reason I can not give Lendio 5 stars is because I had to keep login into my account everyday to check on the status and steps on my application. As I was moving up in steps I expected to receive some type of communication from them at least by email of my process but I did not receive on email. The only email I received was when they had to send my contract to sign my promissory note. But other then that the process was quick and easy and would recommend this company 100%. In the future if I'm ever in need for my business or personally i will come here first.Now I have to update my review.It is now March 23rd, I have yet to be funded and I have called 3 times a week since February 15th and I have yet to be funded eventho my account says funded since February 1st. Everytime I call they expedite my case and I've have yet to hear anything back from anybody. Nobody can find a reason to why I haven't been funded but nobody will not figure out when I will be funded.  This is absurd and ridiculous. They have escalate my case at least 40 times nothing. I can't get a email, phone call or  a text. NOTHING..... I've  called Customers Bank and they have told me time and time again to call Lendio they are the hold up. I'm starting to feel like I've been scammed or something. My funding manager was Maurice now its Autumn Stoop and neither one has reached out evetho I have emailed them over and over again. I'm waiting on the SBA to email me back about them but is absolutely freaking insane.",5
I started this process with the 2nd PPP…,I am honored with the service I was provided.  I will recommend people to your company.,1
Worse company ever,Amazing service .. did my ppp loan with them and it was super easy and fast .. better than the bank that I used the first round of ppp.,1
Very easy and fast turnaround from…,"The team working on my loan worked quickly to get the loan processed. The funding managers didn’t always return emails promptly, but the process was easy to work through.",5
My experience was everything,"Was a seamless process took about took two weeks,",5
Lendio was great,This site was great and Amazing customer service. They sent me a email to confirm that all the details was correct and the process was completed and my funds was in my account within 3 days. I will most definitely recommend Lendio to my friends and family. Thanks!!!,5
I was very pleased with this company…,"The application process for the second draw of the PPP loan was much more extensive than the first draw.  The company that processed my first draw initially said they were no longer processing PPP loans.  After submitting everything and following up with a few additional information requests from my funding managers, I received my loan proceeds in my bank account yesterday!  Thank you Lendio for your professionalism and helping this small business in these challenging times!",5
Excellent all around company from start…,"Doing all the work online made it very easy to access, however there were a few kinks in the system.  I continued to receive notices that documents were missing, but when I would return to our dashboard I didn't see anything being needed.  I used the chat several times to reach someone (chatted with a person once, who told me to just e-mail my taxes returns - which is not secure at all)  I called their main office number a few times and got voice mail.  Eventually, I did get a call back from our assigned representative, who was very nice and let me know that everything was already taken care and funding should be occurring within the next 2 days.

I would say very impressive and fast…,"Lendio was great for PPP Round 1, not so much for Round 2. I've gotten nothing but a runaround, a continuous change of Funding managers, and unhelpful customer service from their online chat.

I'm very disappointed this time with the service I've received from Lendio, and it's customer service people.",5

I had a great experience with Lendio,"I've used 4 different PPP lenders.  Once you get docs in they never get back to you about funding.  You call and email and it's just silence.  It's been 9 days since docs signed and no word on funding.  Everyone else 4 to 5 days.in response, I will look for your call, but online it says ""processing"" and I havent received the email saying the loan has been funded",5

I would recommend Lendio over and over.",5
Held Hostage by Lendio,"Very frustrating. I was only contacted one time by a rep to ask if I was an LLC or sole P. Then I never heard back. 3 different people have been assigned to my loan. I have emailed, texted, and called each rep because I had some questions about uploading additional documents and and I wanted to make sure I was doing it all correctly. Its been about 2 weeks with no one ever responding.   Its very frustrating I don't know if I can recommend....Still no one has reached out.",1
LENDIO is the best,Ray was very helpful. Without his help I would have been lost on the process of the ppp. Thanks Ray!,5
Horrible experience,Lendio made the whole PPP application process a snap and they followed up with me when my bank statement was incomplete they contacted me right away because they didn't want me to lose out as it is first come first serve. They got my application in and I signed the contract yesterday.,1
Great customer service and just a great…,Very easy and straight forward to apply and work with.  Actually have direct number for each loan manager throughout the process.  Very quick and painless.,5
Lendio has been a great asset to our company,she had a quick response and guaranteed to contact my funding manager asap,5
Very Good,Nathan and Mariah with Lendio were super disorganized. They called me last week to verify my documents and were working off of 2019 file even though I supplied 2020.  They said a funding manager would call me.  I waited 7 days and no one called me.  This morning they would not work with me because they said I wasn't calm enough for them.  They are a joke and I cannot recommend them to anyone.,5
SIGNING UP FOR OUR 2ND PPP WAS EASY,"The website for the PPP is simple and easy to use. I had a few issues at first as I think the portal was put online as they were still making changes to what info they needed from applicants. I imagine it was changes that the SBA wanted, but initially it slowed things down. It seems to be solved now as I double checked my application adding the additional info and within 2 days it was accepted, sent to lenders and I had money in my account within 4 days.",5
Very fast and efficient.,Was guided to Lendio from American Express for the 2nd PPP round.

Lendio,"Had a great experience with Lendio on round 1 of PPP but a very poor experience with them on round 2 -- so much so that I went to the trouble of completing the application with another company.  I received multiple text messages from someone saying I needed to hurry and apply but when I replied to this person, they never responded.  I received contradictory emails from the company as well, one saying the application was incomplete, another saying it was in evaluation.  I contacted them 3 times to clarify -- and no response.  I recommend not using them",5

All in all it was a very frustrating and unpleasant experience, My advise stay away!",5

Lendio you need to do everything possible to keep this man around. He made everything very seamless for me and never got flustered or gave me any type of attitude. This is a great guy to have on your team. I would pay some good money to keep a guy like Chris on my team for the long haul.

Its been 3 weeks, I regretfully should have applied with other lenders after the first transfer between specialists. Now it is in the process of being sent to be processed and they are telling me its only been a day!!! It could take another 1 or 2 weeks. Detrimental. Do not use just Lendio, since the first round their customer service declined beyond repair in my case.",5

UPDATE: At A Loss To GREAT Experience (Thanks to Bill Airy),"We got a ppp loan through Lendio so we went back to them when we needed an SBA 7A Express Loan and we were assigned a funding manager named Devin Gambino. He seemed good at first. He said we were well qualified for the loan we were seeking and we went to work providing everything necessary. But then he then pushed a ""bridge loan"" on us for a portion of the funding we needed on us saying this will get you partial funding right away to get your manufacturing started and before the interest is due I will have your SBA loan to you and you will pay off the loan before the interest hits...Sounds great right? Well that was the end of Sept/early Oct. It's February and still no SBA loan. We provided Lendio with so much information over and over and for nothing. Instead we have the high interest merchant loan Devin called a “bridge loan“ deducting money weekly when we still need the funding we originally sought, so basically Devin cost us about 35k in interest and didn't deliver on the SBA Express loan we sought. My advice: Don't get ""Gambino'd."" Don't let someone like Devin Gambino sell you a high interest merchant loan with promises he can land you a low interest loan and quickly pay off the ""bridge loan"" before the high interest loan is due- it's a bridge to nowhere. If you do decide to do business with Lendio def don't get pressured into writing an early positive review of them(Devin did the full court press to write a review from the get go). Tell them you will reserve the review for when the deal is done and you know the results-instead of the promises.",5
My experience with Lendio was fast and easy,Laura was the only one to give me an actual answer and followed up with action. I appreciate her!,5
I was very surprised at how quick the…,"I applied through lendio before the application was updated. I updated the very day it was available. I've been waiting for an email and decided to log in last night, only to find that my ""complete"" status has changed to ""incomplete"". I clicked on the review and it asked me AGAIN, ""did you receive a 1st PPP loan?"". I again clicked ""YES"" and then I got a message to apply through ""Bluevine"". GREAT....so I guess after waiting 2 weeks, I will start over and hope that funds are still available once Bluevine reviews my application. I though Lendio submitted my app to other lenders. I am so frustrated and just completely over this tiny bit of hope I had left. I have never been so stressed and dependent on something in my life. I passed out yesterday and came to with my kids screaming and my daughter on the phone with 911. Apparently stress can induce seizures and the EMT's suggest I reduce my stress level....Thanks Covid-19, Thanks Lendio and a special Thanks to our Government for your devistating response to this pandemic.",4

Very efficient,Great service better than trying to get someone on the phone!,5
Lendio came through when another place…,"Right now, my review is one-stars. It may change. Firstly, the application is continually evolving, and despite that, it is never updated to its full potential. The customer service e-mail system keeps sending me messages telling me that my application is incomplete although, I have uploaded everything requested. My lender keeps asking me for documents and telling me they are required, yet, the application doesn't have boxes to submit this material. For instance, the application says that uploading a voided check is optional. Ergo, I didn't upload one. The Lendio rep then called me and asked for it. Second, the application asks for a February 2020 bank statement, which I supplied. But the representative asked me for January 2020 also. Why not just make a box for this? Then, the rep called me for a payroll register. Independent contractors and people that do gig work don't have a payroll registry. They don't hire ADP to process a paycheck for themselves. It's absurd to even ask for it. Same with asking for 941's from small businesses that have no other employees but the owner.This is not very pleasant, as I am a second draw PPP requester. Everything needed to approve my round two was needed for round one, which they have. Nothing has changed, but me certifying that I earned 25% less revenue in 2020 than in 2019.If you're an independent business person with no employees, I suggest you avoid Lendio.",5
Good service,janda.bouzakis was AWESOME. nice friendly,5
efficient,I needed to upload my front and back id without starting the application again. I guess the ids did not upload the 1st time I did it. The agent said they uploaded the ids when I attached them to the chat. Thank you agent damarcus.ross. Lendio.,5
Outstanding early delivery,good customer service,5
great help from lendio.,Darren Poulsen was very helpful when I had a question about my ppp loan application. Thanks!,5
Lendio was very helpful for our 2nd PPP…,"Hi my name is Angela I am one of the owners in  a small Italian restaurant in NYC, the restaurant industry has been hit hard , we need PPP in order to survive , my experience with Lendio has been exceptional. I have been working with Chris Randall and he has been so kind ,  understanding ,  helpful and knowledgeable  , he helped us with the application . It was very refreshing for me to work with a professional agent such as Chris and professional company such as Lendio . I had a great experience and went to thank you . I recommend Lendio to everyone . Thank you thank you , thank you Chris and Lendio !",5
Thank you Lendio for assisting me in…,"Terrible! I've submitted my application, they keep sending me a email that  ""Lendio reviewed your PPP application, and it’s missing critical information"". They don't even say what is missing. I've been updated my information and document again and again... for two weeks. They don't even answer the phone.  I just withdrawal my application and resubmitted to other company. I hope that I still have time to apply PPP....I totally wasted my time for TWO WEEKS !",5
Good service,"I had an old email on file that I needed to update, as well as I had a question on a status update I was connected to Laura Burnham on the online chart. She did an exceptional job on answering my question, as well as changing my email. She delivered uncommon customer service that was very much appreciated.",5
Awesome!,"Tabitha J Really helped me out!  She went above and beyond, doing something probably a little out of schope and emailing me documents that I really needed.  She was great!",5
Lendio did a great job on our PPP Loan,Tabitha was extremely helpful and answered all of my questions. She was also able to help me with some questions beyond what I first contacted Lendio about while we waited for a reply to an earlier question.  Highly recommended and appreciated.,5
You guys are the best .,Tabitha was excellent. Was freindly on chat and very helpful.,5
great folks to work with an very…,Crystal and Bre have been wonderful.  Jackson (last summer was helpful too.  The application and process leaves much to be desired though. You need to be a computer genius to get through it:(,5
My last contact with Lendio was excelent.,I’m super satisfied,5
Update,"So far so good. All of the customers service reps I've spoken to were all polite and answered my questions quickly. To point out a few Janda Bouzakis, Crystal Fuller and loan manager Faith Royall. They were very helpful. Looking forward to working with Lendio... I give 5 stars",1

PPP Loan,"I applied for a guaranteed SBA PPP loan through Lendio and later received an email that I believe was a glitch. It said that I was turned down. I called and was placed in line for a call back, and although it took several hours to hear back,  Chris called that evening and thoroughly checked each document with me to make sure my application was ready to go. I  feel so much better now and am happy with Lendio for the personalized care!😷😁 Thank You Chris!",5
Disappointing Process and no response,"If your towed you have to make $24,000 in order to be approved it's totally false. Someone obviously needs to read the guidelines again. I know I'm tired of reading them I get misinformed and I have to go back and check it in the course I'm right so I'm going to start answering my own damn questions. This was supposed to be about the little guy this round looks like we're going to have to jump through more hoops. I'm not going to give up though. You can get a list of approved lenders at the SBA I would advise to do that. If you have any questions I can probably answer him better than they can cuz I had to read him so many times. Thanks for reading.Guess im not worth the time to call me and help. Or maybe thay dont known what thay R doing.. my personal opinion of them they suck take your business elsewhere apparently they don't care if they kicked me to somebody else cuz they either don't know how to answer I just don't want to answer my question just ain't got the time for the little guy???Im going straight to the head of the SBA about the situation.Not looking good on the second draw no one can answer my questions.",2
Well inform from the beginning to the…,"I came across Lendio, and the PPP Loan’s and some Lenders, basically doing the hard part (the hour’s on hour’s of research) . LENDIO  has the connections, skills and time to put the necessary time it forth! Yes, I’ve been waiting, worrying and anxiously awaiting, like most of the reviews mention. Anytime I have communicated or expressed my concerns about my PPP loan, I am greeted politely, respectfully and promptly!! I would like to say a BIG THANK YOU, to the whole team.. -TUCSON , AZ",5
I was happy with the process,"I got some vague letter saying my application was missing critical info but no indication of what that was. I emailed them and was told they needed an SOS doc, BTR doc and approved identification. I didn't know what an SOS document was so I had to email them and ask. It stands for Secretary of State. I still don't know what that is.  I uploaded a picture of my driver license and they still ask for it again. Then the BTR. A couple of emails later and I find that it stands for Business Tax Return. I already uploaded it! Oh yeah. We found it. Ugh!Get your crap together folks!I was doing the paperwork for a PPP loan. I'm getting the feeling of the loan application part is this bad then the loan forgiveness part will be a nightmare. I'm going somewhere else. This feels like it is going to be worse than trying to cancel your cable TV where they send you to a dozen people hoping you will just give up.",4
"Thank you, Lendio!","On the ""bad side"": I received several emails stating that my loan application needed ""critical information"" to continue...the emails were vague and I was left trying to figure out where I went wrong.  On the ""bright side"", I got connected quickly with a customer service expert (Katelyn) through the chat feature, and she quickly was able to tell me exactly what I needed to fix.  Fifteen minutes later I was all squared away.    So far, so good.  Now I'm waiting to see the outcome of my application.  I'm a first time Lendio customer.",5

Great Process,Well initially I was having technical issues with getting beyond a certain screen. I used the online help chat. They instructed me on exactly what I should do. I did it and just like that I was able to move on completing my application for the PPP Loan. This is truly my last life line! I'm hope the process goes as smoothly for me as it has for most of you guys! So far I'm giving them a 5Star due to the polite customer service and the online chat who helped me resolve my issue! Will keep you guys posted on the remainder of my experience. Thank You!!!,5

My experience with Lendio and Bluevine…,"i was not sure of all the documents i needed , i submitted my application and was told that it was processing , and on the second contact i was told that my application was getting close to be summitted to a lender and that i should be getting an offer soon , and my case worker was going to reach out to me several times she told me this but never called , next thing my application was kicked out and was told i would receive a phone call never did , so im just guessing or wondering why i was just ignored",4

Great help thank you,I had a great Lendio experience very smooth with a Gentleman named Bronson Rosewood I hade a glitch while applying but he made all the right suggestions over the phone some we could get back inside the portal to finish the application. I would recommend them to others.,5
Lendio communicated effectively…,I lost everything from January 2003 September do to covet virusI have no business left,5
Applying for a 2nd round PPP loan was easy,A friend of ours suggested we give Womply a try for PPP loan & that's how we ended up applying with Lendio.  Our urgency for financial relief is critical so it was calming how easy Lendio's process flowed. I really liked the guidance & updates in helping make sure we submitted all the right items to possibly secure a loan.  I will definitely recommend Lendio to others.,4
Lendio was communicative,"working with Lendio is very easy, all the staff are helpfully & kind.",5
Thank you Lendio group for the timely…,So far my Lendio experience has been positive and the platform super user friendly.  I am actually able to get a timely response from a really live person which is super comforting as I try to keep my business above water in these trying times.

Very fast attention and service.,"Lendio has made this process easy for me, they worked with me to make sure that I turned in all my documents sent me email updates about my status. And if I am approved for the loan I will be able to pay my employees and by much-needed supplies.",5

ETI PPP Application,"**Update- Yes, so i changed my rating from 3 stars to 1 star. #1 they tried to blame the SBA for the delay. I dont respect liars. Especially when they so blatenly lie. Tried to say the SBA changed the PPP loan application and thats why my application is delayed but i talked to 3 other lenders who all say that is a lie.#2 Because of this, my application is still not processed when its was supposed to be expidited. Not only that, Lendio claims they are working hard and advocating for the small business owners. BUT i am a small business owner. And the advantage given to us by the government? Yea, Lendio just squandered it. So if all the PPP funding runs out before i get my loan, you better believe im going to raise ALOT of hell and report Lendio to the SBA because they did it on purpose and lied to cover it up. Im beyond pissed. STAY AWAY FROM LENDIO or you'll get screwed over like me. I should have known better because this was my second experience with Lendio and the first one was horrible as well.So far off to a rocky start already. What i really dont like is that the communication from them isnt all that great and they move kind of slow. I actually appreciate what they stand for. Ive heard of business owners who have indeed received business funding thanks to Lendio so they are definitely a reputable company that i really want to speak highly of its just hard when you've already had a not so good experience and now you see a red flag. I dont want to overreact. Im just feeling a little leary about the second chance im extending.I have a private Facebook group where my followers have been asking me who i recommend for the last few weeks and rthis week, we've all been sharing our experiences thus far. And because Lendio says they have relationships with 10 different CFI's, i recommended them to my followers so that those of us who are women minority business owners would have a reliable resource to get the advantage given to us un this second round of PPP funding. Whats got me feeling concerned is that people who went with other lenders who were on the SBA CFI list are already receiving their documents which is awesome news but the pattern of slow response is already emerging when communicating with Lendio and im PRAYIN that doesnt translate into a slower loan process like before because i am a minority women business owner and the SBA gave us a week advantage so i dont want to get sifted out of that headstart. I hate that i even have to feel this way. I wish i could feel confident in Lendio and thats a huge part of my disappointment. I was previously partnered with MBE which was the most HORRIBLE lender to get matched with the last time around so i was concerned about this whole chain of a relationship.Based on the conversations Ive participated in online, My personal top 2 options were Lendio and Kabbage. I hold Kabbage at a higher regard because just in this last week, the majority of people who have shared their experiences have said that Kabbage is prompt about responding to calls and emails. Last round, Kabbage processed many of their loans were in a week or less. But sadly, i know from experience that with Lendio, emails go unanswered and loans take much longer to be process, around 3 weeks if they use MBE based on mines and others experiences.Im giving 3 stars because its not like Lendio is horrible and i think the slowness is more attributed to the actual lender and not necessarily Lendio. MBE is definitely slow and VERY nonresponsive, but im hoping maybe they learned from their mistakes and hold ups during the first round and have implemented processes to be on top of it this time. The 2 star loss is the lack of communication so early in the process and not being able to really feel confident nor secure in choosing them. Ultimately, my decision to go back to Lendio was because its better logistically as was recommended because it makes the PPP application process quicker and easier as opposed to starting all over developing a relationship with a new company. But not having confidence that it will be a better experience than last time sucks out alot of the excitement i had going in to this.",5
Lendio was great,I thank this company have to tack care of me,5
It seems like there is a disconnect…,"Lendio coming through for us twice now. Drew Hale, stepping to the plate and soliciting so many offers for us. Felt like we were being scouted for business instead of us begging for funds.",4
Excellent experience with this company!,"I applied with my own bank and 3 others in the first round of PPP.  The responses were ridiculous. Our documentation was solid but the banks returned numbers as low as 20% of what we were entitled to.  In desperation I applied with Lendio and was given the correct number we were expecting for the PPP funds.  Now we are applying through them for the 2nd round, and I have no doubt they will take care of us again.",5
Lendio informed me via email regarding…,Can I apply for SBA loan as a Uber driver with no credit score?,5
Responsive,Lendio was very helpful with my first round I been doing business with my bank for 20 years they did not even try to help they looked out for the big dogs I am a small company and Lendio come thru and save my company hope this second round goes as well Thanks Lendio,5
Lendio is quick and efficient for PPP loans!,"I received the 1st round of PPP through Lendio. I couldn't even apply through my bank which I have been doing business with for 14 years! I am so thankful for Lendio! Our small business couldn't have survived without them! Now that funds are low again bc of lockdowns, I am praying that we can get our 2nd round through them again (since my bank is now only accepting 1st round PPP). I highly recommend this company and all they do for small business owners.  Thanks you and God Bless.",5

Poor communication,I tried using other outlets to help me process my PPP loan application and none were successful or easy to understand like Lendio.com My business is happy to have found you!,3

Lendio comes through again...PPP round 2,This company wasted my time.

VERY DEPENDABLE!,"KUDOS TO LENDIO!From the very start I was nothing but confused with the entire process as it was entirely difficult.

Once I had submitted all my documents with Lendio/Tracy, it was nothing but prayer to hopefully get accepted....Weeks later, my business was accepted! Although the money went very....very fast, I am beyond grateful for the services I was provided, and at no cost! Now we are all anticipating PPP ROUND TWO... this time around I know to 'ask' for more funding then the listen. but either way, BEYOND GRATEFUL AND ABSOLUTELY BLESSED TO HAVE LENDIO REPRESENTING ME AND MY BUSINESS!!!

After speaking with John he notified me that I was approved for a loan even though a lot of company’s told me I wasn’t due to the amount of time I’ve been in business and having no recent loan history for the business . He was straight forward The entire time and explained everything throughly . After 24 hrs I was approved and money was in my account. If your a new business only a couple years old and are seeking capital to grow this is a great option . Ask for John stricklin you won’t be disappointed.",5

The rep that walked through everything with me was helpful, and honest about prospects, and identified things that would help or harm my chances, and different financing types best suited for my needs. After the initial call, and a promise to hear back within 48 hours, there was no cantact for about 2 weeks. After that time, I received over 50 phone calls over the course of a week from generic name lenders, most of which after research are operated out of residential addresses. I was finally able to grill one of them enough to find that they got a file opened via lendio, and were following up. I've gotten it down to 2-3 bogus calls a day left, and am getting those off my back too, but its been a solidly terrible experience, and not even any real financing offers to show for it.",4
Awesome Service,Professional and very prompt. We received funding in a very short period of time w limited paperwork. Our Agent Chase was polite and straight forward.,5
The Best and Fast !!,"Our representative, Kade Simmons (Sr. Director at Lendio), blatantly lied about the terms and conditions of our loan, urged us to sign the contract as quickly as possible (supposedly at the insistence of the lender) and then later refused to return any of our calls or messages after we discovered we had been completely lied to and misled. Throughout the entire process, Kade clearly and repeatedly assured us that the loan could be paid off early without penalty, which he knew was our number one prerequisite. We don't mind taking on the occasional high interest loan as long as there is no early payoff penalty since our monthly cashflow is high and we are always able to pay them off quickly. However, instead of the 15-month ~20% interest rate loan we were quoted, we instead ended up with a non-interest-bearing loan with a 35% fixed-sum fee to be paid in full no matter when the loan is paid off. We have received and quickly paid off several six-figure loans over the years, but this was our first time going through an intermediary such as Lendio. Unfortunately for us, we foolishly assumed that Lendio was acting in our best interests and, as a result, didn't vet the details as thoroughly as we normally would have. Lesson learned.",5
Great team to work with.,"Chase with lendio was extremely professional, efficient, and helpful. It has been a tough financial year for most and Chase helped to bring some stability to an unstable time.",5
Excellent experience with Lendio,"Our representative, Brooxie Richards, has been very helpful during the loan forgiveness application process.She has been easy to get in touch with and has answered all our questions and assisted us with filling out and submitting all of the documents.Thank you so much for all your help Ms. Richards!Signed,Alan Kreager",5
Lendio helped me found lenders,"I applied Tuesday, Nov 10th and received an offer and approval Wednesday, Nov 11th. It is literally less than 24 hours. And my rep Chase Hendrickson was very helpful along the way. We communicate via text, phone calls, emails... and they dont require a ton of paperwork like most other companies. Uploading documents is very easy and can do it yourself. There is no hassle with so many questions like most other companies. If you have been denied by so many lending companies, you should try Lendio! Best customer service! Fast Service. Great offers!",5
Excellent Customer Service,Kenzie was so helpful and bright. She figure out what my business needs were and took me by the hand until funding. What a pleasure to do business with Lendio. It is so important to achieve my goals with and in such a profesional manners. Kenzie i am proud of being your return satisfied customer. Thank you.,5
Very efficient process,"Great service, speedy and easy. Matt Graham was great to work with. He was very responsive the entire transaction/underwriting process. He word hard to find the right package that worked for my needs for my business. I tried traditional big banks and it was a complete hastle and waste of time trying to get anyone to do anything, specifically Chase and US Bank. I'd recommend to any small biz owners looking outside of big banks. Thanks Matt",5
I had no problem with them at all they…,"I just love how everyone is so pleasant .

Good job,"Straightforward, Effective, Prompt, and Great Service!",5
Lendio was quick and responsive to our…,"Fundbox and Lendio are working together to complete the loan forgiveness process. Both companies have been excellent in my opinion as I have dealt with both of them. The process of Fundbox contacting Lendio and Lendio contacting me was taking more time than I thought it should, so when Lendio was sending me some information about their loans, I thought I'd  reply telling Lendio that my first priority was to get the loan forgiveness process completed before doing anything else.To my surprise, a Lendio Customer Experience Representative named, Elsie Boyer, contacted me in a matter of minutes of sending the original email to Lendio and provided me with the information I needed to contact Lendio to begin the loan forgiveness process.This was absolutely one of the best experiences I have had with both of these fine companies and makes me feel good to work with them in the future. By far, this was a 5-star experience for me and I hope I get to write another 5-star review when the loan forgiveness process is completed!",5

Working with Lendio was easy and twice…,Oscar was great to work with. It was great to have one representative working with all the different lenders to find me the preferred option instead of getting blasted with phone calls. Lendio's services are a relief to a busy person like me. Oscar kept in contact with any updates and followed through with the lender until funds were in my account.,5
Perfect!,Lendio was easily accessible and easy to work with.  Once I knew what documents they needed from me and got them to them they had a funding solution quickly and the whole process was fairly seamless.  Knowing there’s a lender out there that understands business and I now have them in my corner we can continue grow and thrive with confidence even in these stressful times.,5
The process was made much easier due to…,"Bill is so incredibly helpful, thank you!",5
Great customer service skills,"During the PPP loan application process, I worked with Lendio. I got an immediate response with a real person and that same person followed up.

Ppp loan,Easy and fast. Really happy with their service.,5
Excellent in all aspects,"I did not take a ppp loan. I waited b/c my small business had not experienced too much loss until August or so. Once I was in trouble the loan money was gone. Then September 2nd my business card was hacked and I bounced employee checks on a Friday after 5pm...🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️My bank was gonna take 7-10days to do anything..I’m losing my mind. I completed and application with Lendio and with 5min Brian Jewkes called me...not only did he listen to my awful situation, but he clearly assured me that I wasn’t the only small business Hurting, but he thanked me for trying to do the right thing by using my personal money to help my business get even here!   He then told me what he needed, he walked me through the application Over the phone and email. He promptly answered my emails and phone calls during the process, and once I was approved he then patiently heard what I was comfortable with and said I can get that for you. It’s was done and easy...the next morning I met the GM of my bank and he extended my Business cap-Line and I got what I needed. I actually felt bad b/c Brian Jewkes worked hard at getting me the loan that best fit my situation in an actual emergency and took more time than my actual bank did!    His personal service and professional was as good as my Lawyer, and way better than the service I got at my own Bank. I’d recommend and use Lendio again based off the Service and professionalism of Brian Jewkes alone!   He made me feel safe to use an outside lender when most of us know the dangers of borrowing money as a small business. Thanks",5
Good customer service,It has been a very good experience working with Lendio. They check the paper work thoroughly and follow up with missing items and get clarification and offer advice for right course of action,5
User friendly site and very informative…,The staff at Lendio is great.  A particular shout out to Scheli as she spotted the application issue that had caused me to get denied for a PPP loan from 4 or 5 previous lenders.  None of the other lenders that took my application saw the mistake I was unknowingly making and thus I wasted my entire summer filling out apps and being turned down without ever knowing why.  I would use Lendio any time I have the chance.,5
Fast processing time great customer…,The process was very easy and quick to follow.  My representative was very helpful with follow up and responding.,5
The ease and flexibility of applying…,I decided to use Lendio for my PPP loan based on all the positive reviews. My experience is not.  Applied in July and had to reach out myself in August for an update. Was told still waiting for list of approved PLP numbers (?!?) and would be notified as they came in. Had to reach out again in September.  Was only able to get any answers through the chat online.  Was this time told my application was now being processed by Kabbage and given their contact info. Kabbage did not have any record of my application.  Reached back out to lendio was told someone would contact me.  Waited  2 days with no contact. Called again was told it would be escalated to a mgr and would again have to wait for someone would contact me. I have no faith this will get resolved before the expiration of my application. Poor communication and disorganization. Very quick to point blame elsewhere instead of accepting responsibility and working to resolve issues.,5
I'm truly thankful for you guys,Brandon always taking care of his clients.,5
Happy Customer,Lendio was recommended by Heartland Payroll and by far over my business bank (Citibank) they were more professional and empathetic towards our situation as a small restaurant in this pandemic. I actually am moving my business to a community bank because Citibank was so horrible and community banks give a much more personal experience.Maya Sushi Lounge,5

Thank you so much 😊,"This company is amazing! Easy to work with friendly, and fast turn time",5
I’m giving Lendio a poor rating because…,"If you have any problems at all along the way or don’t qualify they just stop talking to you. They don’t even tell you what’s going on. They asked for a letter stating my old bank account for my business was closed. After I emailed saying my bank was refusing to give me a letter; they just stopped talking. Nobody told me if they could help. Nobody even took a minute to say “sorry, we can’t help you then.” They just care about spitting out as many loans as possible to get their lenders the interest charges. If you want a caring place use Flora. And just as an FYI, I am extremely qualified for loans. So, this was upsetting on so many levels.",2

No responses to text messages or emails. 3 weeks passed no word from anyone. Then I finally called in and someone told me I was already approved for $9,500 weeks ago. Then I was told the next day the loan had been passed off to another loan service company. They gave me an email address to contact someone and these people told me I could get approved for only $2,500. Neither company could explain why or how this discrepancy happened and this left me feeling very confused and distraught. I plan to file in small claims for their negligence.",5

Unlike throwing away our documents because we did not submit all necessary documents, Lendio staff kept following up with us until we submitted all that was needed to make a decision. Such services deserve acknowledgment. Then we received the reference number that the PPP loan has been approved and a few days later, I could not believe my eyes when I checked the account balance and saw the money sitting there.

My only issue was that an agent left me a message with a question and a number to call back. After trying for 2 days to reach him, I gave up and tried texting him. Got an immediate response that way. Please, if you leave a message and a number, also leave the METHOD of how to best reach you. It was frustrating, especially since he had changed my application without consulting me.

thank you for the ease of this process.,"I am giving you FIVE stars because Lendio helped my business FINALLY get the PPP funding that we desperately needed during Covid-19.  This was my third attempt at funding.  The first one, was with my normal bank - a behemoth who gave all their allotted funding away to giant companies leaving none for a small biz like mine.  The second time, the lending agency I was working with dropped our application - said we did not qualify because we didn't complete the application.  However, I did complete it.  they NEVER reached out via phone to clarify- just a an email saying ""nope"" with an explanation that was not true.  I about gave up,  Then Lendio reached out- and I thought, what the heck- one last try.  WIth Lendio's application, there was an anomaly/question about the data submitted.  An ACTUAL HUMAN BEING called me on the phone to clarify-  He then helped me resubmit the application with the newer information that would help the process flow smoothly at the SBA.  It was done quickly and thoroughly.  It took a little bit of work, but we got funded and because of this, our. business is able to reopen again.  THANK YOU LENDIO for having people who cared enough to call me and fix this issue  (which was very small and easily fixed).",5

Then getting a straight asnwer from those lenders never happened.  I found Lendio and discovered they were connected to multiple sources, not just one lender like the attempts above.  And a Lendio rep reached out to give me updates when needed.  Lendio's source fullfilled my loan w/ in just over a month.Lendio's connections are a definate plus and I would recommend them instead of trying just one source and finding out a month or more later that you have to find a new source and start all over again.",5

I finally did get connected to a lender who had terrible yelp reviews, to the point where I questioned whether or not they were a scam.  When I contacted Lendio via phone, they were exceedingly easy to contact and reassured me and explained why the lender got such bad reviews and that the difficulty had been rectified.  I received the loan in two business days after signing the documents.  Lendio helped facilitate a loan when B of A, a bank I have banked with for more than 26 years, did not.  In closing, I would recommend Lendio for the Cares Act loans.",2

Lendio user experience and platform is…,It took 10 full days to receive my PPP loan after signing my promissory note. Lendio is extremely busy so it was very tough to reach anyone by email or phone. Eventually someone would call me a couple of days after leaving a message. I wouldn't say customer service is their strength but the loan application was very straightforward and simple. I can't complain about that and Lendio took care of everything and funded my account about 3 weeks after I applied. I was denied a PPP loan through a couple of other lenders because they couldn't verify my information for some reason. Lendio had no problems with this and got the job done.,5

Avoid,"I was assigned an individual to resolve the problem for an error which an employee of Lendio made 2 months ago.  This person gathered additional information and stated that he would ensure that this time the PPP loan would get processed.  That was 3 weeks ago.  I have called numerous times in the past 2 weeks to the indivdual's direct line and left numerous messages.  I haven't received a returned call. This process has taken over 2 months and still no funding for an error made by a Lendio employee.  We still haven't received any funding.  The original application was messed up by one of your employees and we had to re submit the application.  The original application was submitted a month and a half ago.July 17th, 2020I did receive a call about an hour after my negative post.  One of my businesses did get the funding and hopefully, after the phone call my other business will get the issues sorted out.",2

The staff was very helpful with the…,"I have to often remember that patience is a virtue, and that is so hard to do sometimes in the current pandemic climate, but I realized that I needed to make a correction to a review that I had jumped the gun and posted.  Lendio is great and the people that work there are great and they are very communicative, but they have so many people they must communicate with in times like these that we forget that we are not the only ones.  I think it is human nature to view ourselves as the only one in time of panic.  Drew has been very communicative with me and is working to get me taken care of and I had to change my review because I realized that I had written an unfair review simply because I was not taking into account that I am not Lendio's only customer and that Lendio has 10000 Richard Lisenby's that they are trying to help and communicate with.  Again patience is a virtue and I know these fine folks are doing all they can to get as many of us taken care of as quickly as they can.  thanks for the continued push for us all in our time of need.",5

Lendio & PPP-only one that came through!,"My PPP loan was less than the full amount.  I was only active as a functioning corporation for 9 months of 2019 and the loan amount was based on when my Statement of Information with my S.O.S. office in CA was created, which was incorrect due to payroll started a month after filing my S.O.I. with the S.O.S. I was advised by a customer service rep that I should take the less amount because I could possibly miss the deadline and not receive a loan.  Direct deposit was not working correctly so I was advised again to have PPP funds deposited in my personal banking account and not my business account which makes the paper trail difficult to understand for my accountant.",4

I am not sure if my loan was the direct one through Kabbage or your referal.  Samantha at Lendio was geat.  She was the only saving grace in this situation.  Be sure to keep her.",2

Document Question,"The platform on Lendio was a bit confusing. It kept saying I had to upload documents even after I uploaded them, and I never knew if I had done everything I was supposed to. I also kept getting emails from the system saying documents were missing, but when I went to the site to upload them they were all there. It would be good if the communication was personalized to what I had done (I set up automated personalized communications for my business clients so I know it's possible). The Kabbage platform (their partner I eventually had to make my application on) was better. Overall not too bad of an experience though.",5

So that helped build credibility. Then, I checked reviews, etc. So I applied with you all.  Then within a day you referred me to Kabbage.

I also appreciated the Phillip Kirk who reached out to me to ask for my ID which had apparently not uploaded.  He also responded to me immediately when I received slightly disturbing email from the ultimate lender saying that I would not get the loan because of ""illegal activity"".  Phillip reached out to me to see how things were going and I told him about the email and he reassured me that it had to be a system issue.  It was.  The only downside was that there were long gaps when I heard nothing and started to assume I may have fallen between the cracks.  But compared to Wells Fargo who basically dropped me like a rock and never looked back, you guys rock!",5
Terrible,"Lendio was an absolute pleasure to work with! I had a few questions and concerns.

Thanks to Lendio and the Federal government for supplying the funds. In the end the timing was good because we received the funds after June 5th when the rules changed.",5

My contact was Ken Howard.He did a great job considering all the loans Lendio was processing.

My loan was approved, additional documents were requested by and provided to the actual lender, and the closing documents were executed. (Though no one from the lender has contacted me over the past two weeks about the scheduled date to wire the funds to my firm's account.) I wish there was information on my Lendio account that provides information about the lender's date of funding. I'll reach out to my bank to see if the loan funds have been wired to my business operating account.",5

My representative is Lisa Blick,"Lendio.com is AWESOME! My bank, Chase, only accepted PPP loan applications for 6 days in April and then stopped taking them at all thereafter. Chase kept saying to watch their website for when they would start accepting applications again but they never did. I checked the Chase website constantly for 2 months straight and no one at Chase could be honest with me and tell me they were done taking applications so I was strung along for 2 months until I was a hairs breath from loosing my business and no one at Chase cared anything about me or my business. I've done my business banking with Chase since 2012. I trusted Chase and I couldn't believe Chase would abandon me like that.     With the June 30th. deadline fast approaching to apply, I threw a desperation hail Mary pass to Lendio.com and Lendio matched me with a lender (Ready Capital) and I received my loan funding in just 16 days after applying! Lendio has at least 2 superheros working for them. Spencer Pavich-Conlon and Zach Bingham are superheroes. Their superpower is: they help people. Lendio and Ready Capital are superhero businesses because they help people. Me being old school, I don't forget who helped me when I needed it. I will be doing business moving forward with Lendio and Ready Capital whenever possible. -Grant V. (in Texas)",5
Lendio went above and beyond to help…,Luis Salazar reached out to me to apply for PPP and I wasn’t even sure I qualified.

Great and fast service!,"I applied for a PPP Loan with Lendio, who promised quick turnaround because I'm 7 days from the program end date.As it turns out, they are NOT A LENDER, but an aggregator/referral service to other lenders. As a result, after doing their lengthy online application and uploading supporting docs, I got a text saying I need to apply DIRECTLY with Kabbage... their referral's lender of choice.I asked why they couldn't provide the information from my application with them to Kabbage, saving time and possible the acceptance of the loan in time. The answer was they didn't have a system for that!Why Use a Middle Man? The benefit is their (Makes money on referrals to Lenders) and not the Borrower's.Because of their DECEPTION representing themselves AS A LENDER, my loan is in JEOPARDY OF OF NOT BEING FUNDED because I had to start over the entire application process and docs upload to Kabbage, which now delays my application at a minimum of 2 days. Leaving only 2 working days to process my loan before the deadline.",5
They did an awesome job in helping us…,Somerset was awesome and extremely helpful. She helped me fix the mistake that was on my application and provided me with all the details and needed information.,5
Seriously so helpful and great to work…,I was not having any luck what so ever  with making contact with my paired lender.  Cade replied to my email and then immediately called me.  It took him less than 10 mins to get me all the pertinent info I needed.  Awesome customer service!!!!,5
Highly Recommend!,"It was pleasant to speak with Cade and obtain his kind and helpful assistance.  All too often we hear complaints and not enough praise for a job well done.Cade is a gifted individual worthy of a 5-Star rating.Should you need additional details please feel free to contact me.

This has been such a stressful time and I really appreciate everyone that assisted us. I will always remember their kindness..... I would highly recommend Lendio and their professional and helpful staff. Keep up the awesome work everyone!!!",5
Wonderful service,"It took some time, there was not a lot of communication BUTthey did it in about 6 weeksPaypal was quicker with responses But they did a credit check which I believe is wrong",5
Effective and efficient,"Lack of communication has been the biggest stress in this process.  We had no idea who our lender was or if we even were in any lenders cue for weeks. As a result of no communication we got nervous & applied with a local small bank only to find out that a lender had already gotten an SBA application in which blocked the local banks application. We did not know who the lender was so we had no opportunity to contact them. This became a big mess and many hours were wasted by us and bank officer dealing with this matter.We feel fortunate to finally receive the PPPL loan, but the administration of all of this has been the worst.  I guess we have the government to blame for that.",5
I found Lendio to be very reliable and…,"At first, and generally it was an easy process.  Filling in the fields and uploaded the documents was a breeze, and there was lots of good information offered regarding the PPP loan.  However, once I applied, hearing back about the status was sketchy.  I had to email back twice asking how things were going, and at least I received a reply each time saying it's still processing, which helped set me at ease a bit.  But finally I got two emails saying my application was missing some critical information, but it wouldn't say what was missing.  I logged on five times looking for missing information and couldn't find it.  I opened a chat window and said, Look, I can't figure out what's missing, can you help?  I got a very helpful email in response saying exactly what I needed to do, which was to change two figures in my calculations. Note that originally I used the payroll calculator provided to determine my average payroll and therefore the amount of loan I needed.  I did NOT come up with those numbers, the calculator did. So there was no way for me to know the numbers should be different.  But that changing the numbers per the chat rep's suggestion did the trick, and the loan moved forward.  I know it was a crowded process, and I understand it was rushed into place, so I'm not terribly critical of the how it went down.  I'm just taking off one star due to the confusion about the ""critical information missing"" which took a while to get to the bottom of.  But I appreciate it's been a swift and therefore difficult roll-out.  I'm good.",5
Help with sba loan!,best good excellent,5
Thank you very much for helping us…,"Fabulous.  I was initially provided a lender that was not communicating well. After about 3 weeks, Lendio reached out to ask if things were going ok.  I responded no.  From there the follow up was amazing!  I was contacted directly from a LIVE human and my file was given to another lender...and within 5 days I was signing my loan documents.  Thank You Lendio!!",5
I’m happy to get loan it will help with…,Great experience from start to a quick finish.,5
I liked Lendio,"I was incredibly fortunate to work with Ken Howard in applying for a PPP loan through Lendio.  I wish there were more than 5 stars here; I would definitely add more for Ken.  He was extremely responsive to all my phone calls and e-mails, and readily answered all with very detailed and thorough information.Ken is just a terrific communicator, and because of that, I think he would excel in any field.  Throughout the whole complicated PPP application process, with its numerous details, which were frequently changed mid-stream, Ken carefully and thoughtfully responded to my questions and explained the new steps. I don't think I could have navigated the process without him.I deeply believe that anybody seeking a loan through Lendio would be deeply fortunate to work with Ken Howard in the process.  I highly recommend him in his position.",5

The process was easy & Lendio was very…,"My own bank I have been banking with for 14 years basically told me they were ""to busy"" to process my application for a PPP loan and suggested I try Lendio. I did and I think there may have been some sort of glitch at first because it said our app had been sent to a lender but when we didn't hear from any lenders, after over a month I called Lendio. Probably my fault for waiting so long to call but I wasn't sure how long it took. Well after my call, I got a call back same day and our loan approved same week!",5
Thank you,Thank you so much,5
This is your one stop shop,Excellent service! Lendio contacted me to remind me to complete the application I had started. I had filled out an application with another lender in the mean time and was having a hard time getting a response from them. I decided to give Lendio a chance and wish that I had just stayed with them to begin with. Their customer service representatives answered all of my questions in a timely manner and were able to help me get approved for the loan. I would definitely recommend them!,5
VERY FAST,Somerset was amazing!!  Thank you for the words of encouragement.,5
Possible funding for continued support…,"I initially filled out application for PPP as the first round of monies was announced. I received a confirmation email from Lendio saying they had received my application and due to high volume would be reaching out as soon as possible. After 4 weeks ami received a call from a Lendio employee and they said they needed to know my start date and that my application was being submitted for approval. After a additional 4 weeks of not hearing from anyone and never receiving a call from Lendio even when I left multiple voicemails, I finally found on Lendio webpage which isn’t helpful at all, a chat feature and there I was given the name and number for my loan agent. This loan agent sent me to Kabbage and I received my loan within 6 days",5
Very fast,"Our funding manger, Elisa Zamora, was exceptionally prompt, professional and helpful. There were a few complications on our end, and she was flexible and resourceful in helping us find solutions.  I think it quite likely that our PPP loan request might not have been funded were it not for Ms. Zamora's assistance.",5

The company is professional .,"Lendio connected me with a lender quickly, and communicated well throughout the process. I highly recommend them for any small business lending needs!",4
Loving Lendio,"They were great with getting me connected to a lender. My only complaint is while I was waiting on my deposit and even after I got my deposit, lendio didn’t have a clue of what was going on with my account. I thinks that’s very messy because that shows that information was not getting transferred to the right person at the right time and that can become a problem, lucky I still got my loan even though they had no clue of what was going on.",5
Professional,a bit confusing on the exact docs I needed to upload and I uploaded docs 2 and three times...but overall pretty good,5
Outstanding Experience,Use friendly and easy to apply. Processing very fast.,5
From the beginning of the application…,The first lender I was paired with was terrible. Lendio quickly rectified the issue and set me up with a second lender who made everything a breeze. I had PPP funds within 3 days of applying with the second lender. Lendio was a great resource to help navigate SBA loans.,5

Everything went well,Brandon Tafoya was very helpful in getting my PPP loan funded.,5
Great,Never waste your time with these guys. They hooked us up with a so called lender. The SBA approved our PPL loan but the lender Lendio tied us into wont respond nor will they help. Lendio then claim they have nothing to do with loans they just a web portal. Wish I had never encountered them total waste of time. Now I am stuck with an SBA approved PPL loan to their lender who wont respond to anything. My own banks approved me but cant get the SBA funds cause the crappy Lendio lender has the funds but wont process the loan. NEVER EVER use these guys.The Lendio rep is also less than helpful he never responds when I ask whats going on. STAY AWAY,5

I'm very disappointed.",5
Very easy process and the PPP loan…,"They did a fine job with handling the issues that popped up with their partners.

Good service and guidance.,Very professional and willing to help. Thank you,5

Very engaging and quick to respond,"I applied for the PPP and it took over 2 months to finally be funded. I did receive a general correspondence from Lendio, but my loan was transferred to Ready Capital who I was then told was transferred to Customer Bank. There was no ability to call or talk to any real person about what my status was. I had to submit paperwork more than once. I am glad that I was finally funded since I got my application in and money was reserved for me in the first round, however it was a very frustrating process.",5
Easy and seamless,Pretty easy process.  Just took quite awhile to hear back.,5
The whole process took less than 2…,"Lendio was a dream and Cade (the customer service person) was sooo friendly and fun and informative. The whole process was quick and easy and I was approved within 48 hours and had a nice pile of miracle money in my biz account within 48 hours of that. I had applied with a much bigger, more “household name” bank weeks before and never heard anything and I’m overjoyed that a friend on FB alerted me to the fact that smaller community banks had more available funds and told me that Lendio could help. I’m very grateful and can breathe a bit of a sigh of relief during these mad, uncertain times. If you have a corporation and haven’t applied for PPP and haven’t known who to work with,  do it today with Lendio.",5
Information was limited,Stellar in customer service.Attention in detail.Very easy to use forms.Follow ups very easy to obtain,3

I appreciate the timely matter to help…,"I found Lendio easy to deal with. I began the PPP process with my bank who failed to help me. I tried another place and the application process was more complex and the application left no room for error. there was no way to edit, and I was denied. When I first inquired with Lendio there was some lag time...not more then week and a half.  Lendio referred me to a partner and the process was simple. I received info from a Partner but was not aware that might happen and was reluctant to fill out application. I checked with Lendio and they were very responsive and reassured me I should fill out application. I did and within a week or so I was approved and sent to SBA. That process was quick as well. Money arrived in bank last week. I referred Lendio to a friend who was also having difficulty with the PPP process and told him how responsive and easy the process was. Not certain of his status.",5

Efficient Service.,"I gave them 4 stars because we did get the loan.  However, once we filled out the application on line there was no way to check the progress. I got a call for missing info and then still couldn't track to see what was happening with the application.  Then, when they sent it to lenders I was not notified who it was sent to and had no way to track that progress either.  When we got the funds I had one lender asking for more information and apparently another one was processing the application and actually got the loan to go through.  Then I had a third lender send a message saying the loan was denied- my guess is because it had already gone through and the funds had been dispersed.",5

Quick, responsive, professional, are some of the adjectives that come to mind.  I was treated like someone that mattered, in stark contrast to my experience with the ""big bank"" where I have my deposit accounts.  Lendio kept me well informed through the PPP application submission and funding process.  I have been a raving fan to my business owner friends and I know of at least one that I sent your way.  I am delighted to once again be submitting a loan application to you.  I know that as I continue to grow my business, Lendio will be my essential partner supporting me along the way.",5
