Scamer-like phone call experience.,"I received email asking me to call at a number. I called, they collected all my private data, ssn, previous address, date of birth. Then transferred me to a guy in India who said I need to update my online account. I feel I was scammed - they do have my recent address, I receive ads in my paper mail from them. Interaction made me very worried.",1
poor ease of use,the online verification process is subpar to say the least ..it has some issues with safari users according to the rep I spoke to. Fidelity on the other hand handle the same thing in less than 3 minutes for a rollover. I'll be waiting for an email to confirm my login verification..,1
Transfer of funds without consent,"My 401a was transferred to your company without my knowledge or consent. You chose to ""welcome"" me to your company by using an home address from an employer who I stopped working for 8 years ago. You took $60 in fees without my consent. In order to get my funds transferred back to my fidelity portfolio I need a statement - which are produced only annually?!",1
Poor directions just to open an‚Ä¶,Poor directions just to open an account. Poor customer service via phone as well.,1
SCAM ARTISTS,"I did not get a notification that my 401K had been transferred to Millennium Trust. I had to call Empower Retirement to get that information. The company then gave me a long form to fill out to get it transferred. It was very inconvenient so I decided to delay the process.Fast forward two years, I am on the website with the intent to transfer my account to Mutual Of America and I discover Millennium Trust has been charging me an annual fee and statement fee for my account. I NEVER got a statement because they had my address wrong and never notified me of an annual fee. They were just taking money from me with no regard or guilt. Scam artists ‚Äî be ashamed of yourselves.",1
Took my money and forced me to pay a fee to get it back.,"Millennium Trust accepted money from my 401k in error, I wanted T. Rowe Price to send it directly to me. But, I had to go through Millennium trust to get it back. I then had to pay a fee to get my own money back and close an account that I never consented to opening.",1
I never received confirmation  so‚Ä¶,"I never received confirmation emails so I had to continuously call to know if my money was received, my account was setup, etc.  Your fees are too high. I already setup a transfer to vanguard and I can‚Äôt get my money out of your organization fast enough.  AND you are making that process painfully slow too.  Basically, your organization sucks!",1
"Excessive and unnecessary requirements to access personal account. At last check, there is only my name, no actual Information, activity,  not so much as an account balance.","This is not my 1st IRA account. But is 1st last and only account this group will hold of mine ever. The methods and effort it  takes to access one's account online is extreme and excessively unnecessary. I suppose it is successful effort on their part to hold onto my money for their gain while they do nothing to improve my balance. Only transactions have been annual deduction of fees, period. Further, I have not received any sort of contact or update from this group via mail, email, nor phone since DEC 2020.This account was opened in early 2019. Just knowing the annual fee plus the 'closing of the account fee' will further deplete my funds, makes me both angry and sick.",1
Takes extremely long to send money and‚Ä¶,Takes extremely long to send money and never have up to date information it‚Äôs such a hassle to receive my own money,1
Can't wait to never do business with‚Ä¶,"Can't wait to never do business with these thieves again.  To be fair, if you love fees and terrible customer service you are going to have a great time interacting with them.  Everyone else should run away fast.",1
Called because my employer rolled over‚Ä¶,"Called because my employer rolled over my 401k to Millennium.  I was informed that I had to do everything online that she couldn‚Äôt even assist with a withdrawal.  Now I am dealing with a continuous circle.  The online verification process says my email is verified but when I try to login it keeps taking me back saying I need to enter the verification number.  Not an enjoyable experience.  This started 10/7 then I worked on it again 10/10.  I was also informed I could login on my phone but it states in the email that a laptop or desktop is preferable.  This is not compatible with phone at all, a laptop or desktop should be used.",1
Awful Process,Awful Process!  Person I spoke with was helpful.  Horrible process that I can‚Äôt handle my accounts at the same time.,1
My 401k got vacated and moved to MT,"My 401k got vacated and moved to MT, didnt know that had happened.Was put into a money market account and had less money in their that when I made my last deposit 8 years ago. Poor growth even though we have had the losses in the market. Had to provide old address to prove it was me but being that I have had 3 addresses since then hard to prove witch one, and they cant tell you what one matches of course. Many more documents sent and rejected for wrong address a quick 2-3 weeks later and several phone calls and waiting periods. I now have access to an online account. And you can only do rollovers if you have your online account set up. One thing after another, by far one of the more difficult places I have dealt with for simple things. Hope you dont get stuck with themüëç",1
I can not get my distribution with out‚Ä¶,I can not get my distribution with out a check or deposit slip and I don‚Äôt use checks or physical deposits so I can‚Äôt get my distribution. I think that is so dam stupid no one uses checks anymore or physical deposit slips it‚Äôs all done electronically. So what do I do? Get with the times!,1
I have been wanting for my $ that was‚Ä¶,"I have been wanting for my $ that was issue on September 1st we are on October , over a month n still waiting for my money , first card I have received and is not good they requested another card for me with out my knowledge,  so finally I get in contact with customers care , and to tell me that it was issue another card and I still have to wait 7 to 10 business day .... horrible process I wouldn't recommend this Millennium trust company to no one .. never ever ..Marisol Cruz",1
Horrible,"Horrible. Still have not processed cash from one account into another, both at Millennium, and the first of 4 requests were received on Sept 20. Also have not transferred two of our accounts to another custodian after 2 weeks. Would never use Millennium again and we have been there for years. Very dissatisfied",1
Account was transferred over to them,Account was transferred over to them. No notification that they are the account holder from prior 401k. Then get a charge of $25 for them having my money. Then to close the account is another charge by them.,1
Felt I was an inconvenience,Person I spoke to was short and I felt I was a disruption and inconvenience to her with my request,2
Lack of human interface and website a major pain,"Spent over and hour just trying to see what my balance was. Created new account online, and at the very last step, site wouldn‚Äôt send verification codes to my phone. (Worked fine throughout signup process)They arrived 20 minutes later. The ‚Äòdigital assistant‚Äô was utterly useless and wasted a lot more time. On the plus side I was finally able to reach a human being who tried (unsuccessfully) to help me. Process shouldn‚Äôt have had to take me more than an hour. Hoping future dealings will be better than my introduction.",2
I did not like that I was rolled over‚Ä¶,"I did not like that I was rolled over to this company from my old one, and the maintenance fee and closing account fee is just another way to rob people of their own money",1
Can‚Äôt get access to account,"I was notified that I had funds in an account 3 months ago. I still have not been able to access my account. It is absolutely brutal trying to set up an account! I am pretty confident they do not want me to have access at this point‚Ä¶.sending pictures of a license, validating home address, etc‚Ä¶..",1

P.O. Box or fedex,"When I requested a prepaid card, it stated it would not be mailed to a P.O. Box and it would be sent fedex. So I entered my physical address. I don‚Äôt get usps mail sent to my house. But the customer service representative stated my card is mailed by usps not fedex. So my card will be sent back to the company and then I was told I‚Äôd be charge an additional fee for new card. So frustrating.",1
"Yes, they answer the phone, but that's not helpful","I spent an hour on the phone, winding through the interminable maze of things necessary to get my rollover funds dispersed to my financial advisor, specifically making sure they issued the check correctly. Of course that did not happen. Now I'm trying to fix it, and they are apparently unable to do what we need. And they keep pointing out what I supposedly did not do correctly, despite the fact that it was their representative on the phone working with us to issue the check. Frustrated does not begin to cover it. I will probably take the tax hit and deposit the check rather than continue to work with these useless people.",1
You took all my money‚Ä¶,You took all my money with the ridiculous fees you charge. I had no idea my money transferred to millennium because it used to be in mass mutual. By the time I got a hold of it my account was drained. I‚Äôll be telling every soul never to go near this company.,1
I‚Äôve had more pleasant experiences at‚Ä¶,I‚Äôve had more pleasant experiences at the DMV than I‚Äôve had here. I‚Äôve been trying to remove my money from their fee happy hands for over 5 years. They take every possible step to ensure that they can continue to drain fees from my account. I swear this is the only reason they‚Äôre still in business. I would rather have a root canal on a roller coaster than ever deal with this company again. I‚Äôm also pretty sure they‚Äôll find a way to charge me a fee for writing this review. Also notice they don‚Äôt respond to negative reviews. They only respond to positive ones. That should tell you everything you need to know about a company right there.,1
This has been a very frustrating‚Ä¶,"This has been a very frustrating process. Nearly impossible to navigate when having multiple accounts and trying to withdrawal money. I have been trying since the 1st of September to initiate an online account and take out the money. Yesterday I tried to speak with a customer service rep and he was clearly working from home. Dogs barking, children screaming. I think they make it very difficult to set up an account and remove your money so they can keep pulling out fees and charges.",1

My money was sent to Millennium Trust‚Ä¶,"My money was sent to Millennium Trust from MetLife.   Was never told the money was being sent there.   I call  Millennium Trust and the agent was friendly. She explained that it would be a few days before my money would show in the system.   I looked almost every day to see if my money was in there because I wanted to originally take it from MetLife.   It finally shows up in the Millennium Trust account and to my utter surprise,  they charged me s $35 annual fee on the same day my money finally showed in the system.    Charging me an annual fee when my money just went over!!!   I sent an email and asked for a callback from someone, but only received a call back after I made another call and sent the email.  I was not a happy person.   I called back two days ago and asked to have the fee charge reversed.   Does not show anything about that.   Not happy.   I will never do business with them again.   The agent I spoke to was friendly, no complaints with the two or three people I spoke with.  After doing this review and a few phone calls,  my $35 was returned.  However, they charged me a $10 fee when I requested a disbursement.   So they returned my $35 but charged me a $10 fee in order for me to take my money out so they still made money from me.   At this point, I was just glad to get my funds from them.",2
I‚Äôve never dealt with a custodian that‚Ä¶,"I‚Äôve never dealt with a custodian that makes things so difficult. They do everything to hold on to your money and make you jump through excessive hoops to get it transferred. In my last dealing with one of their reps the person either hung up or we lost connection, either way is not good.",1
an easier way to acquire their money,im still having trouble getting my money,1
Company is pretty easy to transfer out‚Ä¶,Company is pretty easy to transfer out but expensive to use. My old employer started using Millennium Trust for their 403b and there‚Äôs a monthly fee to use and a $25 fee to transfer to a different company.,2
Not helpful,Not helpful. Wasted my time. Told me what I provided was all wrong etc. Called back and spoke to a manager and found out what I needed to. This girl needs more training.,1
I‚Äôve been unable to log in to my‚Ä¶,I‚Äôve been unable to log in to my account. My company closed the IRA they were putting in to and my account got transferred to Millennium. I couldn‚Äôt figure out why I could not completely log onto my account when I finally called it was because the last letter of my name was left off. I had to send in a copy of my ID it was told it would be fixed the next day. I just called a week later and it was never input it. I had to do the whole process once again. I felt such little care for this as soon as I can login to my account I will be pulling my money from this company and not choosing to continue to use it,2
Employee was not knowledgeable,Employee was not knowledgeable in transferring of funds to another IRA with a different company. Instructions very unclear and vague as if she was trying to avoid the question.,1
I was forced into a roll over to this‚Ä¶,I was forced into a roll over to this company and when I opted to roll over to the company I work for instead they charged me an account opening fee and a closing fee all with in the 7 days that I was notified that the roll over would happen.,1
"Bad communication, not transferring money as requested",I requested for my IRA from my old job to be transferred to my current Financial Advisor months ago. They said they needed the correct address. I gave it to them and heard nothing else. The money still has not been sent to my Financial Advisor. My Financial Advisor tried contacting Millennium Trust and they will not give any information or provide any direction.,1
Very displeased I had to be online for‚Ä¶,Very displeased I had to be online for 15 minutes I had to call at least four times and still yet I have not gotten the things I need to withdraw from you.,1
No Trust,"While I understand that services like yours are technically legal, I can‚Äôt begin to understand why. Technically T Rowe price rolled over my 401(k) to millennium trust automatically and without notice. However, the fact that millennium trust traffics in this sort of service, makes me instinctually distrust them.",2
"Comme si comme sa, as they say in Spain","When I was fortunate enough to have the time to break through the labyrinth of automated messages and speak to an actual person, this actual person was quite helpful.As an aside, I note that MTC is still stating ""we are receiving a higher than normal call volume, so you may experience a longer than usual wait"".I experienced this message for nearly a year. At what point does ""higher than normal"" and ""longer than usual"" become ""normal"" and ""usual""?The solution? Hire more people, and/or pay the ones that you hire more money so that they stay. The automated stuff doesn't cut if 98% of the time.The generic, cut and paste response you provided doesn't instill much confidence. If you want to ""make sure we‚Äôre providing the best experience possible and the resources you need"", the solution is easy (please see above).",2
I struggled for months to get my‚Ä¶,I struggled for months to get my identity authenticated. It is very hard to get ahold of anyone and reaching anyone online is a joke. I spoke to 3 different people and they all told me completely different reasons as to why my identity was not authenticated yet. The first agent actually told me she didn't know how to help me and to call back in a few days.,1
IRA rollover request,I've been in the process of trying to get the funds from my IRA account rolled over to my new employers retirement account and it has been a nightmare. Millennium trust has emailed me time and time again that I did not submit the forms correctly even after following their instruction via phone and email on how to submit my rollover request. This has been going on for more than a month at this point. I'm not sure if they know what they are doing over there but this is definitely not a company I would work with. BEWARE!,1
I just want to find my money,So many points to identify me for an account that I did not set up.  I gave everything correct.  But I do not have a passphrase so I have to set one up.  The second question to set up the passphase is the last 4 of account #.  If I'm calling to find out about money that was sent to your company without my knowledge how do you expect me to have that info??????,1
I was told that my request for‚Ä¶,"I was told that my request for distribution was all set to go by one agent and then received an email stating that I needed to give them a call and another agent, who was not very friendly, told me that I needed to submit more info. I was expecting to receive my funds this coming Friday 9/23. But instead the process has started over for another 10 days.",1
Your company did not help me one bit,"Your company did not help me one bit, & I know I'll receive a recorded message no doubt. All I'm asking for is guidance, not a recorded message, even though my balance is low, it may not be in the future.Your company does not make it easy to help, despite your claims.Please advise, don't put me on hold for 2.5 hours, then exit the call (hang up), you're probably laughing at my claim, but it's true, all I'm looking for is help.I'm tired of not being listened to.-Liam Beesley",1
Challenge to access account info,I had the most difficult time getting my account access and it should not have been so hard. Because I would not send my personal data and social security info on email this hindered me from getting access in a timely manner. The codes and access to login were also incorrect and I had to call multiple times and spend more time than I have on the line with a lovely customer service rep that kept telling me it was ok to send my personal info to their secure email but having had identify theft that was not ok for me. We finally agreed to a work around where I encrypted my document with a password and someone called me to open the file. But this was just not how business should be done. Very frustrating.,1
not recommend this bank!,I had a difficult time in retrieving my money. Kept getting the tic tok move that no one was willing to help me. Till finally I was able to get my funds and close that account. After trying 3 to 4times for 5 years.in that time lost some funds they charged me every year $60.00 to hold my money there excessive amount plus what they took just to get the little bit of funds left.,2
The Representative was so stuck on‚Ä¶,The Representative was so stuck on ‚Äúprotocol‚Äú that I couldn‚Äôt even ask a generic question about whether we could use our form or they had a specific form. He said he had to talk to the owner of the account just to tell me whether they have their own forms ridiculous protocol,1
This has been an extremely frustrating‚Ä¶,"This has been an extremely frustrating company to deal with.  Trying to access 401k funds that were transferred from another company.  It's almost as if there are hoops to be jumped through so that this company can keep others' funds and collect interest while simultaneously charging 'fees'.  They send a six digit code after verifying you, but they supposedly send a second code to an email which never arrives.  No it is not in the junk folder.  May have to get a lawyer involved.",1
Never Again,"First, I haven‚Äôt received the direct deposited funds yet and it has been over a week. Second, I can‚Äôt even log in with my credentials. Third, I haven‚Äôt been able to track the status of the request because I can‚Äôt find the place to do it as it was not included in the email.",1
I couldn't even log in,I couldn't even log in. It just kept cycling into the log in page and refreshing without ever logging in.,1
I did all this inputting my info,"I did all this inputting my info. Who knows what happened next, so I called and told them what I did, they said they had my info. And it would take one to two weeks for my request they said it takes 3 weeks,I waited and nothing!! So I looked online at my account and they did not process my request and they did not notify me that it wasn't done and or why, nothing!! Thanks for not doing business with me, just do whatever the he'll that you want, then sure why let me know, in that case.",1
You have failed to find my paperwork,"You have failed to find my paperwork, which may require us to send it again, (for Trust acct)  I have not been able to register my account online.The only bright light in this process is Celine in customer service. She is trying to resolve this.",1
A mostly negative experience,"We transferred an IRA from Millennium to another provider. The experience was complicated and non-intuitive, and took 3 weeks from the date that the other provider submitted the transfer paperwork directly to Millennium. The other provider does not charge any of the fees that Millennium charges, including annual account maintenance (even if funds remain uninvested in a money market acct) and transfer related fees. The website was not very intuitive, especially when the transfer already occurred, there was no notification about this of any kind, online or via email (we had to call to confirm transfer status). The website kept looping to same page with no explanation why account access was not possible. The tier 1 customer support via phone was repeatedly rude. She did not allow asking clarifying questions, and instead transferred us with no explanation, putting on a 10 minute hold. Tier 2 customer support was a different story, knowledgeable and courteous. Terrible training and low standards for Tier 1 are a show stopper. Unfortunately, as a result of these experiences, Millennium falls far short of competition and I will never again use or recommend them. Much room for improvement.",1
I spent 35 minutes on your website‚Ä¶,"I spent 35 minutes on your website yesterday trying to accomplish and easy task, another 20 minutes today and another 30 minutes on the phone with someone from your company still trying to accomplish an easy task. Boy, you people sure don't want to give people their money do you?  Word to the wise, pull your money now before they decide to 'verify' you to death in an attempt to just keep your money.",1
I have been on the phone with Milennium‚Ä¶,"I have been on the phone with Milennium Trust Company several times over the past few months (since July 26, 2022) in regard to 2 IRA balances that were transferred from Capital One, since Capital One decided to no longer handle IRA accounts. I have yet to see my money transferred to my current bank, where I requested it be transferred to. All required paperwork was completed and submitted and this was verified by my bank. I am currrently in the process of seeking legal guidance on this matter so that an attorney can communicate directly with Millenium Trust Company.",1
Not easy,"This has been the most difficult process I've experienced in a while. The site is not user friendly, I'm very frustrated.",1
Website is sooooooo aggravating when‚Ä¶,"Website is sooooooo aggravating when you click the ""submit forms later"" for a voided check. Literally have to jump through hoops on the website to try and find how to submit a voided check late. Will not want to deal with this company again.",1
Horrible company!,"I wish I caught my ira from previous employment before it rolled to this company. Terrible service from millennium. I will forever stay with and trust fidelity and always used them for my ira investments due to their speedy responsiveness, great service and SAME DAY transfers, always hassle free with them. I called  Millennium to get my money faster to close on my house on a Wednesday, told by representative I would get a call back from a supervisor, never got that call, had to check in again friday and no luck. Had to wait until Monday to get my money and close late on my home! Glad to have closed my account and will catch my roll overs before they ever get transferred to this company again. Horrible service members. Even worse supervisors. All around terrible experience.",1
My experience today on September 21st‚Ä¶,My experience today on September 21st 2022 was not a good experience. My customer service rep Mina from Chicago was excellent and very patient with me. My experience with trying to cash out of my retirement funds was time consuming and unaccomplished. Although I complete one of my retirement accounts the IRA Roth I still have to send a photo of my check stub in order to get my money. I could not get money out of the 401 k today because I can only do one account at the time. So I have to do it all over again tomorrow.It has to be a better way to get your funds without going through this long process. On top of that you still have to wait about 2 weeks to get your funds.,1
While the employees I spoke with are‚Ä¶,"While the employees I spoke with are very pleasant, overall, there is a lack of fundamental communication with their clients, and very generalized information on email confirmations, with little to no details on the next steps after you‚Äôve submitted a withdrawal request. Compared to other Trust companies I‚Äôve worked with, this is by far the longest it has taken to have a disbursement distributed to my account - currently going on 10+ business days now. Again, the people were nice, but I will use a different Trust company in the future with more efficient logistics and personalized communication.",2
Their website is very difficult to‚Ä¶,Their website is very difficult to navigate and logging into my account has required a phone call every time in order to gain access. This has been true for the last two years. I am now trying to close out my account with them.,1
Horrible,"Horrible, horrible, horrible. Had my funds sent here by a previous employer and it has been MONTHS and I'm still unable to get my money away from them and onto my current employer's plan. Online ""customer service"" will send you in circles, insisting you didn't submit forms you absolutely did. Template answers only, no real humans to be found. They very transparently work to prevent you being able to get your money away from them (and will steal your money the second they have it in ""fees"" to open the account you never asked for, and fees to close it if/when you ever manage to get your money back). How this place hasn't been shut down as the scam it is is beyond me.",1

My account from my previous employer‚Ä¶,My account from my previous employer was moved here with out my knowledge and within a month of finding my account and starting the process to receive my money from the account half of it had already been sold off and lost.

Terrible company,Not user friendly n reply was not at all helpful,1
Took over a month to access my account,"I had a 401k switch to Millenium Trust with no notification. I had to hunt down the account holder and was given the wrong info twice. I found the money and registered as a client. The website didnt work to upload photos to verify identity. Had to email them, then it took two more weeks to hear from them that i had access to my account. I made numerous calls to try to navigate the website. Everyone i spoke with had to solve a different problem. They told me it was fixed, but got off the phone and an email said it would be three more business days to get into my account. Very frustrating!",1
Bad customer service,"I was told when withdrawing my ira, it would take 1 to 2 business days to direct deposit.  Yesterday, was the 5th business day and still.....nothing. I can't get any response when inquiring about my tracking number other than if there is a problem I will be contacted.",1
I had a 401k switch to Millenium Trust‚Ä¶,"I have tried numerous times to access my Millennium account online. I set a password, they send a code, then ask for a phone number. The text to my phone always says ""access unavailable for this user"". Perhaps that is because I only have a simple TracFone. When I contact the company by telephone, they say they have reset everything and I will have access.  NO, apparently not. They have asked if perhaps one of my daughters might help with this, but if I use another person's phone, then that number is on permanent record as the contact. Surely i am not the only person without a smart phone, so I have a hard time believing that there is not another way to accomplish setting up access to my account. Very discouraging!",1
I was told when withdrawing my ira,I asked you to give me the information on how to rollover my old 401K to my new company and you said you would email me in 1-2 business days. No response on my accounts. This is the extent of my experience.,1
online account access,Unable to register on the website. I have no idea what money I have available because I have been trying to register for two days and get an error message every time. Now I‚Äôm scared this company isn‚Äôt legit and I‚Äôve put my info out there.,1

Horrible,Horrible phone training. Talked over me. No empathy. Did not listened and I'm concerned she'll share my personal information,1
Curse words,I would never refer Millennium Trust to ANYONE. It‚Äôs Horrible. They put you through hoops to give you your money. And customer service is horrible.,1
Horrible phone training,"Attempted to close account through distribution, website was frustrating as I couldn't continue my request with the tracking number it gave. After re-requesting I had to prove my bank account was mine by supplying a voided check.  So I reached into my check book and....oh wait it's 2022 nobody has a checkbook.  I got what I now know is called a starter check from my bank, it was not accepted as my name was written not printed. However I was not notified that my starter check was not sufficient after 5 days, I called the help line and was told it wasn't sufficient proof. The gentleman said a direct deposit form would work just fine. Would've been nice for the website to mention ANY OF THIS. So here I am, one week into the process, no confirmation email or anything and I have to wait potentially 10 business days to receive my distribution. Thanks millenium trust for making me jump through frustrating hoops with little to no info as to where we are in the process just to get, MY MONEY. Never again.",1
Horrible...,"Gloria was very disrespectful by not letting me speak or explain my situation and demand social security, when she insisted  that she could not wait so long in  the line, I let her know that my husband was working and that I only needed his authorization, already a Once he answered the phone, he asked for a moment to look at a photo since he does not have it memorized his social, she insisted and insisted to the point that my husband said that she was behaving in a very bad way, not letting him speak. I told her that the Spanish line took a long time and if we could speak Spanish, she answered I can't speak Spanish to you, because you chose the English option, when she said she does speak Spanish, this had never happened to me‚Ä¶ this is very unprofessional, rude to the point of arguing with me, and have to raise my voice and hang up at her .",1

They sent all the documentation to Millennium Trust at the beginning of August, along with a follow-up letter in mid-August.  As of the end of August, Millennium Trust has no record of receiving the paperwork, and nothing has happened.  They clearly have serious problems with the handling of documents received by paper mail.  And . . . Even since that time, more documents have been mailed to the *correct* address, a fax has been sent to the correct number (I saw the confirmation), and Millennium Trust still has no record of anything.  I called customer support, but all they tell me is that they haven't received anything.  This whole thing sounds really suspicious to me.",1

I submitted what I thought was sufficient documentation from the new 401K fund(Fidelity) following the paperwork requirements by mtrust. All I got was - this is not enough, here review our list of 30+ bullet points. Which is what I followed initially. I emailed them back asking for clarification as to which bullet points did I miss or if they can tell me what else I need to submit. I got a very vague, lazy email saying ""call this number"" clearly trying to push the responsibility to somebody else who answers the phone calls. I pulled my money and closed my account.

Waste of time and money,"My employer selected Millennium Trust to handle connecting me with the IRA they had established on my behalf. After I left my job, I wanted to roll over this balance to a ROTH IRA with Fidelity. Millennium Trust made the process exceptionally challenging to complete what I wanted to do. It took me at least 10-15 hours to talk to people on the phone, send emails, generate letters, find printers, and mail things. Somehow Millenium Trust requires wet signatures in our modern society. I started with the automated letter generator from Fidelity because it contained all the details Millenium Requested for doing a rollover. When I submitted the form as the systems specified, I was told I had made mistakes and that they could not complete my request. I then called Fidelity, and they helped me generate a different letter, and the agent confirmed that they deal with rolling over accounts with Millennium all the time - thus they were sure this would be an easy process. After mailing them this letter from Fidelity, they once again told me I had made a mistake and were unable to complete my request. Finally, I called Millenium, and the rude agent scoffed at my issue and directed me to another way to close the account. Ultimately, there is not enough guidance for transitioning accounts, and what should have taken an hour or two was drawn out over an entire month. Very disappointed.",1
No service or communication,I've been trying to register to the portal for access to my account for over a week.  At this time I am still waiting for access to be approved.,1
Slow withdraw - transfer,I was unable to get a response regarding my accounts distribution. It has now been 6 business days and the ACH isn‚Äôt even pending with my bank.,1
Rollovers Need More Guidance,I tried withdrawing from my account today but the process was difficult so I could not.,2
I've been trying to register to the‚Ä¶,"I was stuck with them when my account was transferred without my knowledge from TIAA. Millenium had no record of me for weeks, even though the money was transferred electronically. Finally, after about 3 weeks and many pointless phone calls, they informed me that they found the transfer, but were missing some information, so were waiting on TIAA to get that to them. Finally, after a month, I was able to open an account. Had to pay a $35 fee for starters, which sucked. Then trades cost $8/each. I haven't paid for a stock trade in years! So that sucks. First stock purchase went through, but got an error message on second one. Something like ""could not execute trade. Ambiguous something..."" So I tried to trade again. Same error. I tried a third time, and only then, after more poking around, did I realize that hey... the trades had gone through. Dang. So multiple of the same trade at $8/pop. Ridiculous. Oh well, I figured I'd eat it. Next disappointment came the following day, when I tried to set up dividend reinvestment. Couldn't find any way to do that on the website. So I called in, and after some checking with others, the agent informed me that they don't do dividend reinvestment for stocks or ETF's, just for mutual funds. What garbage! So I'd need to manually come in every month and make a purchase (with a big trading fee!). Forget that. I decided to switch this Roth IRA over to Fidelity, which doesn't have crazy excess fees, doesn't lose my money for a month, actually does dividend reinvestment (DRIP) easily right on their webpage, etc, etc, etc. A far superior company. Every other brokerage I've used (TIAA, Transunion, Sofi, Etrade, etc, ) are all VASTLY better than Millenium Trust in every way I can imagine. I'll be happy when my Roth is out of Millennium's control, and I can stop the bleeding. Goodbye and good riddance!!!",2

Operator was not helpful,All due respect I'm not pleased at all! I worked hard for what little money my past employer rolled over which was $908.50... Well since then I am so it has depreciated and I got hit with a lot of things and almost 7 months ago I requested from my bank which is synthetic credit Union for my money to be rolled over well on your end I guess you didn't get it and it was sent by my banker she is a manager who does her job efficiently so I don't know why anyone from mutual trust did not receive my transferred paperwork by the bank a financial institution. And it's taking me through a whole bunch of loops just to transfer my money so for that I'm really not liking this organization so hopefully I can get this issue resolved really soon I had to log on into the system and become a member and that was something I did not want to do I simply wanted my funds rolled over and transferred into my personal bank account which would make an IRA that I was trying to set up and that I will do very soon of course meanwhile by waiting on this process my money is dumbing down in your system and that's something I'm just not agreeing with!,1

I received an email on 9/15 saying there was an issue.  On 9/16/22, I went into the portal and uploaded a copy of the check again.  I then called to follow up and spoke with Jackie in Chicago who advised my name has to be on the check.  My name is on the account, however, we use checks minimally and have never ordered new checks with my name on the account.  The address is on the check and I offered to send a copy of the bank statement with my name on the account which is listed on the check.  They advised I would have to contact the bank, have them submit a one page document on letterhead with account number, routing number, and my name as being on the account.  My major issue is that now the process starts all over again and I have to wait 10 more business days for the funds to be processed.  If I would have known this when I spoke with Melissa, I could have addressed the issue then.  No matter what I do, the process starts all over again today and it will take 2 MORE weeks (10 business days) before the funds are processed.

They didn‚Äôt really help n customer‚Ä¶,"I my ex company didn't want to deal with managing their pensions any more I guess. So they transferred it to Millenium Trust into an IRA.  My IRA is less than $4K. It was set up with the following fees:1. $30/year for ""management"" (they literally do nothing, no investment strategy, nothing.  Just sits in an account earning 25 cents / month).2. They also charged me $10 just to send the notification in the mail to me that they now had my IRA funds.  And this $10 is also a yearly fee (for each annual report)By the time I was able to intervene, They had removed $70 from my IRA. And my ""managed"" retirement savings had earned $3.3. Oh, and as a final parting display of Wall Street greed, they will take another $25 from my savings as a ""Closing Account Fee"" when I roll it into my Roth, which is managed by an honest company with NO yearly fees. Thanks for robbing a poor working stiff's miniscule retirement savings.  Enjoy your ill-gotten gains.  We are sharpening the guillotine for all of you Wall Street leeches.  The pitch-forks are coming.UPDATE: To their credit, Millenium Trust called me after this review and restored the $70 in maintenance fees they had so far taken out.  I'm still going to transfer my money out though, and will still pay the $25 fee to close the account.  But I appreciate this gesture from them.",1

Every person I have talked to always‚Ä¶,"Millennium Trust's customer service for individual account holders sucks. It does everything in its power to put a customer through automated chatbots, which can be decent guides for people who don't actually educate themselves with what the website has to offer, but is a black hole for when you need the answer to a question that the website does not clarify. Their ""live contact"" link goes to what appears to be a chat window, with ""live chat"" in big letters, and ""waiting for agent"" at the top. Truth is, agent will never come. But they never tell you that. They're trying to lead you through a tree of questions, where all it does is give you links to other parts of their website. And it actually has nothing to do with the availability of an agent during business hours. This is the experience 24/7.At some point, the chatbot will eventually tell you that if you need more help, to contact support. Isn't that *exactly* what this Support Link/Live Chat is supposed to be? (and this Contact page to get support is itself conveniently buried under ""Profile"", otherwise you won't find it anywhere else). And when they tell you to contact support, they don't even specify how. It takes another path through Q&A to get to the point where they give you a number to call (these places usually do a great job of hiding any contact phone number).  When you call the number, of course it tries to keep you away from a real person for as long as possible, but if you call during (east coast) business hours, eventually you'll  get a real person.I eventually was able to talk to a real person, but it took me from a Friday to Monday morning to realize what was going on and how things worked. The interaction with the agent itself was fine and this is not a commentary on the experience with the agent.I understand that Millennium Trust is probably built to serve large institutions more than retail account holders, but still, that bulls*** ""live chat"" and ""waiting for agent"" is exceptionally and purposely deceptive.",1
I have yet to receive my transfer,"my call was taken by Yolanda from Nevada. She started off speaking very quickly and I had to ask her to slow down. Her directions were unclear to me. When I explained what I wanted, she sarcastically said that's called a rollover"". i asked her if she was going to help me with the rollover process she said yes. She asked me for my personal information so I gave it to her. She then emailed me a long letter with a link, told me to read it and fill it out. She explained I need to put in all my details which I had just provided to her. Confused, I explained I just gave it to her and she said I need to add more information. Being that is was lengthy email with instructions, I was unclear if she would stay on the line while I read through the email and link attached, etc. to guide me through it. She said yes she would (what I understood as she would stay on the line). Yolanda abruptly ended the call. Prior to contacting Mellinnium Trust I had been on the phone with customer reps from both Transamerica and Prudential (now Empower). Their customer service was excellent. Although I was withdrawing my 403b funds and I never created an online account with Transamerica, the representative walked me through the rollover process. He explained their process, went over email he sent as while we were on the telephone and even made a conference call to Prudential.  They both helped thru the process in a respectful, coherent and patient manner. If my call had been calling Mellinnium Trust for  anything other than rolling over, it would have definitely turned into a rollover after her poor service.",1

She didn't even consider looking into whether what I was saying was true. My experience with this company has shown them to be confusing, inefficient, ineffective, and inaccurate.

Gave the lady all the information she asked for - last 4 digits, full name, address, date of birth, which company did the 401K originate from, etc. and she still wouldn't let me have the statement. Now have to wait for her to send me a verification form to complete and mail back to her.  When that's received, they'll send the last statement to me.  How long will all that take?  About 10 days?It is shocking that you cannot cater better to old people.  This is a very small 40lK - just about $3,000, and nobody is interested in helping me.  Shame on you.",1

Too many fees,I never received notice that Fidelity was going to move my funds to Millennium.

If they didn‚Äôt I will have to seek restitution,1
I can‚Äôt get a hold of anyone.,MTC takes very long to reply to the process that they themselves have instituted for private placement.

Misleading,"I was charged over $200 for processing my 401k disbursement. They charged me the $100 which is my future year‚Äôs fee for handling, and $100 for closing my account since my disbursement was $2700 the balance of my 401k before taxes. They justified by saying I was late paying. So they took me coming and going. I have now paid a fee for next year AND I‚Äôve paid for closing the account. I tried explaining too that I had sent a check to them and Hard Assets each at the same time. Hard Aseets received theirs fine but Millenium never cashed theirs. I asked Celina, my contact for this transaction, twice, for reconsideration of taking all of these fees, but she never responded. I think what they did is horrible. That‚Äôs why I give them a one.",1
Absolutely the worst,"Millennium Trust received a transfer of pension-related funds belonging to me about which they did not notify me over the past 10 years plus. The institution that provided the pension did not contact me either to indicate that they money would be transferred to Millennium Trust. Millennium Trust has been charging me a maintenance fee since receipt of my money. Upon learning about these funds, I contacted them ten days ago to initiate the process for transferring the money into a 401K. They instructed me to complete a form and wait for a follow up email from them to continue and conclude the transfer process. I have yet to receive anything from them (except for this comment request). Significantly, I also do not know whether or not they will refund the maintenance fees they extracted, because they did not bother to obtain an updated address for me. It seems that the process should not be so opaque and sloppy, and I am disappointed that with their fiduicary responsibility, they did not make any effort to contact me about my pension fund.",1

I do appreciate them reaching out after my original review.,1
Could of done the same thing myself,"A balance from a previous employer‚Äôs 401k rolled over into a Millennium Trust IRA without my knowledge. No one can explain to me why the balance remained in the 401k in the first place (I rolled the account over 3 months after separating from my previous employer and 10 months before the current balance was transferred to MT). I filled out paperwork prepared by my bank to transfer from MT to my preferred IRA, but I‚Äôm receiving email messages that claim there‚Äôs not sufficient information to perform the rollover (including missing my signature‚Äîwhich I absolutely signed). MT‚Äôs web portals are buggy and poorly designed. Phone and chat ‚Äúsupport‚Äù is really geared toward providing no support at all (or at least only functionality that is already available in other formats).

Basically, I‚Äôm giving MT $30 to complicate my life with adminstrata that should have been settled months ago.",2

How can i do a demand  on you ???,"I have been trying to 'work' with Millenium Trust for two months now, to simply transfer cash from two custodial accounts over to an equivalent account on their platform. I've worked with a couple other custodians and this is typically filling out the appropriate forms and then waiting for the transfer to happen - that's not the case with Millenium Trust. I have many HOURS invested in filling out forms on their web site and then following-up to make sure they act on them, only to be sent the same forms via hardcopy (sometime 2 or three times) as if I hadn't filled them out already. Then, following-up on the new forms because no action takes place from there....and wait, and wait and then follow-up again. Trying to get a human on the phone there is a chore because they have automated menus that try to deter human contact - be it phone or chat. Trying to get simple beneficiary information entered properly was another matter - again, fill out their only form and then they complain that I need to fill out this 'other' form because I had submitted a trust, which I had not and I made that clear to them three times. Add to the tab three or four follow-ups to get them to fix both my beneficiary accounts because they either didn't act on my wishes or didn't act as indicated on the form. I  think Millenium Trust probably have good people working there, but their processes demonstrate a culture of ineptitude and I'm perplexed why Fundrise is requiring I work with them for custodial services because I'm not going to move any more of my retirement funds into Millenium Trust - life is too short to have to micro-manage my account custodian and since they are responsible for my retirement funds, that is of grave concern to me.",1

I see that it is private; I assure you the owners aren't investing in the service side. Talking to a human is a phone tree ordeal, then you get people that literally don't know what they are doing. They can't transfer calls without dropping you, or you end up in another queue. The staff you do talk to seems new and unsure of what they are doing with paperwork. Want to escalate and talk to a manager - just forget about it, you won't live that long. Want a call back after leaving a message (*voice and email) - it hasn't happened after about 8 tries - not one return call or email. I have been trying to get a ""case"" worked for 4 business days. They have lost emails, asked repeatedly for the same things, and then made absolutely no progress. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY IF YOU CAN HELP IT.",2

Verify me,The company did not say anything except go create an account online. Did that almost a year ago. Now they need me to send in proof of who I am??? The fees are high and the service person I spoke with could use more management support with answers.,1
i am stuck in a constant loop,All the fees that were associated with me getting my money back is ridiculous. I put money into my retirement to be able to have it and then it just gets rolled over to some kind of Ira thing that never even got money added to it. I won't refer anyone to y'all,1

The customer service was terrible,Your web site is not user friendly for someone like me who is not technologically savvy.  It was very stressful trying to navigate your system!,1
What an inefficient system!,I wasn‚Äôt consulted with having my small amount of 220$ to be rolled over to your company.  Then I was charged 40$ worth of fees including an annual maintenance fee for a new account less than 2 weeks old and additional 25$ to cash it out on top of the 10% federal tax penalty.

Did not fulfill my needs.,"I‚Äôve been trying to move an old 401k from Millennium Trust for basically 2 years now. Now, it has not been constant, but it‚Äôs taken so long because they make it so impossible to get anything done. They do not have online options and require paper everything even from the bigger companies. Their process is painfully unnecessarily long.They do not send regular information, I do not recall the last time I received an account overview or statement of any kind. They charge fees, which I am pretty sure if why they make it so impossible to get your money out of the account.Stay away, stay far far far away.Additionally, they only respond to comments who leave positive reviews, if that doesn‚Äôt speak volumes, I don‚Äôt know what does.",1

This is the first place Ive had charge a fee for closing out my account. It seems as if its some sort of scam to make you decide to stay but with all the fees your account will go down to nothing. Wouldn't recommend this company.,1
I was hung up on after holding for 20‚Ä¶,"The representative was helpful and patient.  The company's account set-up is ABYSMAL.  Very few sign-up features actually work.  as you set up your account, the MFA steps for iphone users (I assume that these are many, by the way), suck.  I got duplicate verification codes, multiple times (and no - I didn't click the button more than once to generate a code).  I must admit that clicking the button twice to generate a code would have been an intuitive thing to do, as it took an UNREASONABLY LONG TIME for the code to be texted to the user (me).  Apparently, Millenium Trust is using an inferior, low-cost SMS provider with terrible latency.  So - fair warning:  if you have an iphone, and you seek to verify your identity using SMS, you will likely get TWO verification codes sent to you, one immediately after the other, but you will have to wait an inordinately long period of time to get these two codes.  The next, begged question is ""which code do I enter?"" Logic would suggest to enter the more recent code.  DON'T DO THIS - it will fail.  Enter the first code sent - this is the only way I was able to get it to work.  Do you see the picture here ?  UNACCEPTABLE - AMATEUR HOUR.  Don't do business with this company - there are many other, better options.  Overall - a very bad experience.",1
I submitted a form to receive a check‚Ä¶,I simply wanted my account number took two hours to get through the system started on Iphone 12 with safari browser switched to chrome at agents request.

The company did not say anything except‚Ä¶,"Requested a early withdraw that is suppose to take up to five business days to complete. It has been nine business days and no word. I called and spoke with an ""agent"" who was coughing loudly on the phone and didn't seem interested in helping much, she sounded very tired and bored. I let her know I was just checking, since, I had not heard anything. She told me it takes up to five business day to process, and that I just needed to wait. I informed her it had been past the process time by a few days and just wanted an update on the status. She seemed irritated and then placed me on hold for about ten minutes, only to get back on the phone and tell me they do not know the status of my withdraw or where it is during the process. She did inform me that her ""team leader"" sent an email out to the company to handle it immediately. Whether or not they actually sent any email, I don't know. I feel like they just wanted to get me off the phone. As of today, I'm still waiting on word of what's going on.

Now I will sacrifice at least $10.00 to get it back and the identity portion to do it is monstrous. Every single time you log on to the site it's the the full Monty. How can anyone protect their ID? This is why I object to these life sucking entities to begin with. There will never be retirements built by forcing the working class to build their retirements with entities who invest your money and then lose 25% a year. What's worse...I never consented to using these products ever.",1
Maintenance fees,next to impossible to get your money moved to a different account,1
not good,It‚Äôs been a month and I didn‚Äôt get my withdrawal. Turns out millennium canceled it without warning because I didn‚Äôt respond to an email that was not sent. So I lost $10.

It‚Äôs been a month and no withdrawal,Well 1 my name is spelt wrong on the email for this review. 2 I started on my distribution early June I was on the phone with Kevin who told me everything was good and all I need to do was send a voided check. Then after the so-called 5 days to review I haven‚Äôt received anything so I was worried with having to send a voided check. So I called and I was told my distribution was started but not completed. So after waiting 5 days already now I would have to finish it and wait another 5-7 days for my distribution. Which I needed it days ago and if I didn‚Äôt call I would of knew known no one sent a email or called about it. Again just told me after I filled everything out to send a void check and that‚Äôs all I needed to do. But when I called back after not receiving anything in my account I talked to a lady who set on the phone with me made sure I got the email and walked me through everything. That‚Äôs why I gave a 2 star because that lady was VERY helpful but the experience and lack of communication and still to this day having to wait longer for my distribution is why I rated so low.

Thank you for the assist in getting into my account.",2
I have no words,Got disconnect after my third call---have been trying for 2 weeks to gain access to my account called back AGAIN still didn't get into my account was told someone would call me back no one called back. Any suggestions??,1
I haven't got my money yet and it's‚Ä¶,"The website is REALLY SLOW. Getting to the places I needed to get to took a long time too.

Rpe on the phone was nice and patient, that was the best part of the service...",1
Everything took to long to verify,"Prior to today, I would have given MT a solid ""F"".  Nothing that I tried previously worked regarding getting control of my IRA.  Very frustrating.",2

Millennium Trust Customer Service is TERRIBLE,Both accounts were not listed when I went to view them. Only Roth  & not the IRA showed up. The total of these were over 5k and should not have been transferred to Millenium to only be hit with multiple fees that were excessive!Now I am being told there is a ridiculous fee to close out the account and transfer the funds to LPL where they should have gone like they did before.Kem,1
Automatic assistant hang off phone 3‚Ä¶,My 401 was moved to Millinium from TIAA through the Diocies of Orange it was moved over at $459.00. I was earning .36 cents on my account and charged $35.00 each year for processing. including other fees I withdrew the remainder of the funds out because my investment company was taking more than I was earning. I left with less than $375. if I would not have called to withdraw they would have taken it all. I should have recieved a alert or a notification I was losing money. instead millennium just kept taking and would have until it was all gone Gerard Chavez714 539-9488,2

However Millennium Trust requires your personal bank to contact them in order to do this, and my bank has told me they are the only institution that does this and has a form specifically because of them. Charges money for transfer and closing out the account when I never consented to them being the account holder in the first place.",1
No customer relationship,very disappointed at being moved here from Vangaurd by my employer and not being able to get any investment advice AND being charged 30 dollars for this inconveneince,1
Did not send corespondents each year to‚Ä¶,First of all let me say this. I was never told by my former employer that the money I had in that 401k account t of thiers would be moved. Second of all what the heck were u people doing taking money out of that account? I was never warned properly of that action.Only when I went to move the money did I see I had lost 100.00 dollars of it.So really in all actuality you  people are just another parasite preying on the unsuspecting public.,1
DO NOT USE THIS SUBSTANDARD COMPANY,"Have to jump through hoops many times to prove my identity over and over again just to get Millennium Trust to send a check (FBO me) to my ROTH IRA at another financial institution. I get that there are protections in place to prevent fraud, but I didn't authorize Millennium Trust to accept my funds from a former employer in the first place. Perhaps Millennium Trust should practice the same diligence prior to receiving FBO funds without obtaining release from the owner before opening accounts. Not to mention the fees charged without notifying me and obtaining an approval. And can I speak with a human being?!! I'd rather not communicate with an automated system every single time and option after option.",1

When I tried to roll my 401k from you into my personal bank investment account I got an email that you couldn't do that but I could move it into my checking. That option was never given up until that point. Why are my options not clearly stated upon me logging into your crappy webstie? Then, on top of it all, you're stealing $25 from me when you did absolutely nothing with my money in the first place to earn it.

I Didn't Open or Authorize Account,"I did not chose Millenium Trust, my prior employer 401(k) migrated assets here, so I was stuck with them.  First, it took over 2 weeks from the time my account was migrated to the time I was finally able to access my account, including 5 separate calls to Millennium.  Next, their login in process to setup your new account requries 7 different click throughs to acknowlege items on their website. What shoud be a 1 minute process takes over 5 because of all of the ""Accepting of Terms"" required to setup your account.Then their list of fees they charge is absurd.  $10 for a paper statement, annual holding fees, transaction fees, processing fees.  It is absolutely ridiculous.The first chance I get, I will be moving my funds from them and not do business with them.",1
Hidden fees,The interface is clunky and not intuitive.,1

Also I‚Äôve been trying to just rollover my employment plan to my new employers plan and they literally make you just wanna liquidate the account because of frustration.

My Employer send my 403b to Mellinim,Why does it take 20 business days to look at a account? I put into my 402 every 2 weeks and you very happy tool my money. When I want to cash it out oh no 20 business days which equal to a month. Why is what I want to know. I believe your like the dann government you take my money but when I want it back you are so damn greedy you don't want to let go of said money. This is why I don't put my money in one. You people are down right disgusting and make me sick.,1
My experience has been that the portal‚Ä¶,02 cent and 01 cent check sent,1

I never got a notification in regard my‚Ä¶,Agent was great but the process to recover funds is terrible. Not many places have checks and you have more than enough information to process a distribution over the phone like fidelity and other banks. I will never leave my money with your financial institution in the future. I‚Äôm trying to secure funds quickly for a house and you have delayed my process. Very very dissatisfied.Not sure if right hand talks to the left. I received a call saying I needed to submit an additional signature page and was sent 2 emails. I called back and they confirmed I needed to resubmit the same documents since they don't take electronic signatures like docusign(another failing) and a signature page. I submitted the documents immediately yet they called back 2 hours later saying they read my review and asking if I resubmitted my documents. I guess they didn't check before calling. I wish I could give a zero for this process. Looking forward to staying only with Fidelity in the future.,1
Not a financial institution you want‚Ä¶,I have tried to work with this company for over a year now--the CS was not helpful and hold time too long for working people.,1
I recieved the check I requested,You're website is really crappy and extremely hard to navigate. Your system is also very unresponsive. I have an extremely low view of your company and it has been a nightmare working with you.,1
Very few options for disbursement + a fee,MT exists for a single purpose. Getting every fine they can out of any money you put in. Zero dollar returns and fees out the wazoo. Would have given 0 stars if i could have,2
Having a problem getting through the‚Ä¶,my money transferred to you by employer ..lots of high cost fees. finally got my money out of your greedy hands....lol.. never again.really hard to get access to my account to transfer my money away from your company.,1
Excessive fees,So far one of the worst companies I have ever dealt with. My account was rolled over to them two weeks ago. I did not receive notification. I have not received an account number. The process to roll it back to Fidelity is cumbersome and time consuming. Very stressful experience.,1
I tried calling for my account number‚Ä¶,I have been on hold for over an hour!  I want to transfer my IRA account because Millennium Trust charges $35 per year to manage my IRA and a $25 penalty if I wish to transfer to a different management company. AWFUL!,1
So not only did my money just shrink‚Ä¶,"I spend 30 minutes in line waiting to talk to a customer service rep just to find out that I am still missing some paperwork, no one told me about and never received communication that it was needed. Then the rep told me I would have to wait whatever time I have to wait!!!",2
Terrible customer service,"Every encounter I have had with your company has been difficult, and it usually takes me at least 4 different visits and hours of my time to accomplish the most basic tasks.  The only reason I do business with you is because unfortunately you are the agent for my bank stock.",1

No Personal Touch,"It's been painfully ineffective in trying to conduct business with Millennium Trust. The web interface customer service create work loops that have to resolve.

Can‚Äôt give a review,You dropped the ball on transferring money to my Schwab account.,2
Thank you for your service,I am severely displease with the fact the very small amount of money from the 401k that was never supposed to have been sent to this bank. I was charged fees on money that was parked in addition to not allowing me to correct the name in the bank information as I had gotten divorce and dropped the married name. their chat does not provide the customer service needed either.,2
The worst,"The world would be a better place if this company went out of business. They fail at their basic functions.  UX is terrible, confusing and difficult to navigate. Customer service is awful. Their fees are ridiculous. I can‚Äôt wait to unwind my investments and close my account permanently.",1

Beware of Suspect Practices,"I called in and spoke to a woman about getting my money rolled over. She said it was done online and that she would send instructions to my email. She never did. I guess she didn‚Äôt like it when she asked me to spell my email address to her, which wasn‚Äôt hard to figure out and I refused to. It was two common words followed by a number. Not very difficult. So with no instructions being sent, I had to figure it out myself. I did it myself. Thanks customer service for doing nothing for me. I love the message you get saying that you are extremely busy and the gold times are long. I never waited more than 20 seconds to speak to someone. Update your phone messages please.",1

But then when I called in, David claimed he never received it.  So I asked him, why did you send me an email saying you received it?  To which he replied he must have lost it.  Are you kidding me?  So I sent it again, he received it, he verified the wiring instructions and told me it would be processed that day (Friday).  Well it wasn't processed.  So on Monday morning I called and talked to Melanie and she talked to Sarah in Processing, and they assured me it would be processed by end of day.  Well, end of day came and went, still not processed.  So I called again, after talking to Melanie, she put me through to Sarah who explained she didn't get to it.  Again, are you kidding me?

Difficult encounters,No one notified me of creating account when I received the letter it was 3 weeks after account being created. Making it so I would not be able to get my full investment. The letter states within 7 days the company is sure to notify you by mail well after receiving and setting up account.,1
Too long a wait,I think your processes are too slow. I also think we should be able to set up a speedier system once cash hits our account to be transferred out. We seem to be paying for a trustee service that doesn't provide a good customer experience,1
Booooo,I have sent in my SS card twice to verify and a letter from the bank twice to get my money and still haven't heard anything. My fellow employee did hers the same day as me and she didn't have to have any type of verification and had her money in her account within two days.,1
I have called in three times in regard‚Ä¶,I requested my money weeks ago. And still not a sign of it. And terrible customer service.,1
did awful i havent get my money yet‚Ä¶,"Two of the representatives that I talked to were very rude and didn't seem to care about helping me. I was having trouble confirming my identity even though I had submitted my documentation via the website and had saved the tracking numbers. It was evident that both representatives hated their job and weren't even remotely interested in trying to help me find a solution. When they explained what went wrong, it was difficult to follow. It didn't seem to me like they were well trained because they fumbled over their words. However, I do have to give kudos to Grear. She was amazing! We lost connection once, and she called me back right away. While one of the rude representatives did not call me back when either she hanged up or lost connection.",1
Really bad customer service,Refused to give us our account numbers on our accounts. It took a month to get them after our old emplyer transfered to Millennium. Couldnt get a person on the phone. Then system was down.. Then it will take 24 hours.. Every excuse!!!,1
Things should have processed quicker,Rude and not helpful not to mention gave bad advice.,1
It's been painfully ineffective in‚Ä¶,"After my 401K was ‚Äòacquired‚Äô by MTrust and had to pay fees to get my remaining funds, I get notice that they have taken over PayFlex HSA. Sadly Health Saving Account funds are not transferable unless in a current high deductible plan. I now have to work with these people again‚Ä¶UGH!",2
You dropped the ball on transferring‚Ä¶,"My employee transferred my 401K  account with this institution,  without even know Millennium Trust hit me with a year fee, I have an IRA with Fidelity for more than 20 years and they never ever charged me any annual fee to keep my account , neither AmeriTrade, this company is a fraud.  They charged for everything, even to move my money  with Fidelity.   I don't recommend MT to no body.   ADIOS!!!!!",1
I am severely displease with the fact‚Ä¶,"My 401K was moved to this company without my authorization.  I understand that previous employer initiated the transfer, but I did not authorize them to do that either.  I should have been properly contacted, so that I can handle my funds as I deem appropriate.",1
The world would be a better place if‚Ä¶,"Very unclear explanations and in the end I was told that everyone is spammed with a notice stating that they should wait for a 1099-R and important tax information for closing an account. I never received a form so called asking about this, I was told to ignore the email that it isn't relevant for my taxes.",1
I have been waiting over 14 days for my‚Ä¶,Very difficult to speak with a live rep. Inconsistent information provide all across,1
I have contacted Millennium twice‚Ä¶,"Neah, the agent, was rude. She didn't listen and therefore didn't understand why I was calling (which was to ensure I provided you an accurate address for the rollover to the TSP). She then was discernably angry when I tried to clarify why I was calling.",1
Poor customer service.,"My 401k was rolled over without notice to me. These clowns charge huge fees for everything. Once I went to pullout, boom, another few for closing everything out electronically. What a joke.",1
Took too long to transfer 401k funds,"Your IRA rollover time is to long, a 20 day transfer period is excessive. Also Most wealth management companies send their paperwork to a customer's preferred fiduciary to handle.",1
Was un aware that I had an account and‚Ä¶,"The transfer into Millennium from Fidelity of this account was not completed on schedule.  Upon my initial contact, I was advised that Millennium could not discuss as they had no info.  Once receipt was confirmed, Millennium could not process a transfer out into an existing IRA account held at another custodian before 20 business days have elapsed.  No, the service and timing are far from satisfactory.",2
Poor company,"My original investment started at over $500. In a few years, it dwindled down to $150 all due to fees. This company did nothing for my investment probably due to it being a smaller amount‚Ä¶ disappointing there was ZERO positive return to even cancel out a fee.",1
They took my money while just sitting‚Ä¶,"Everything about the process of opening and closing my account was terrible. Had multiple glitches, couldn‚Äôt talk to a human and was a total pain in the ass. I will never use this outfit again.",1
What customer service?,The customer service man that I talked with was not very helpful and is attitude was very bad. I have worked at a bank for 22 years he acted like we knew nothing about doing IRA rollovers . Hopefully we did it correctly but haven‚Äôt heard anything back yet .,1
Not friendly cold and distance and I‚Ä¶,"I feel that I have been cheated, swindled and robbed. Millennium Trust took my savings, pocketed a huge percentage without any reasonable explanation, and deposited only a small fraction of those funds into my account. This is outrageous!",1
re website is difficult to navigate,Customer rep was getting short with me when I asked a few questions for clarity,1
Charged $800 in holding fees and gained‚Ä¶,I have requested disbursement of my 401K funds and it has been 15 business days and still no money has hit my account. I have done business with both Vanguard and Fidelity and it has never taken this long to get my money disbursement. Your competitors only take 2-3 business days to disburse payment. You need to change your business practices.,1
Im waiting for my card at last 15 days‚Ä¶,Fees are excessive and needless. Many other companies provide similar services without charging the ridiculous fees that this company does.,2
Asking for help in transfer my account that get sent to your company,My account was transferred to you automatically and i strongly disagree with having to pay a maintenance fee and a fee to close the account.,1
Impatient customer service agent and‚Ä¶,"Millennium Trust took 50% of my principal amount in fees.  I do not believe there are any other firms taking such high fees.  My principal amount was low, and there is no mechanism for them to see that they have TAKEN ALL OF ONE'S MONEY; and they do not seem to care.This is outrageous and it must be called to the attention of regulators and legislators.  It may not bother someone with a huge principal amount, this happened to be a small one - IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE AND MORALLY BANKRUPT. I have asked for the fees to be replaced to my account.  Of course there would be no appreciation as they kept siphoning out as much as they could.  OUTRAGEOUS.",2
Man I spoke with was completely rude‚Ä¶,"Tried to sign up, there system timed-out.  No idea where I am in there system.",1
I'm not sure why you are not behind‚Ä¶,System is ridiculous trying to set up account and the fees are excessive compared to other brokerages I've used for rollover IRAs.,1
Takes 10-12 days for a distribution‚Ä¶,"The model of this company is to ""buy"" low value IRAs, turn them into money market accounts, and charge outrageous yearly fees and paying fees for the pleasure. Scam business model that congress needs to ban. Do not to business with.",1
Retirement fund dropped 33 percent in 3‚Ä¶,I‚Äôm trying to login and unable to login keeps on telling me error not able to send text to confirm login,1
Exorbitant fees for transactions,"I've been with this company for a few years now since they bought out my old Self-directed IRA company. I'll cut to the chase and let you know they are terrible! Their response time is horrific. If they say 3-7 days, you'll need to give them 3 weeks. They charge fees for everything and are great about making excuses with the most common one being, ""It is being processed"", which is really code for ""it's sitting on someone's desk."" I can't transfer my accounts from them fast enough!",1
My T.Row Price account was sent to this‚Ä¶,"I filled out the proper forms to have my rollover retirement money from a previous job deposited into my bank account. After a couple days MT informed me they had sent my money to the bank, so I waited a day or two and contacted my bank. The bank said the money had not been sent. After emailing back and forth I was able to get Brenda, an actual human from MT, on the phone. Brenda informed me that MT sent my money to my bank and the bank sent it back to them, it will be $30 charge for having to send it twice. Okay whatever fine, just send it again. They said they needed me to send them a voided check to make sure the account number and all is correct. So I sent the check to them last week and have sent a couple follow up emails. No response from them since I sent the check. So now MT has my retirement money AND my bank information. If I don't hear back soon I guess I will have to close my bank account and open a new one. Then hire a lawyer to get my money from them. As far as I can tell, this company sucks.",1
Neither the representative  or the app‚Ä¶,Long delay to make a withdrawal of funds.  17 days from when I complete the form and I still receive responses,1

I sent my direct deposit slip 13‚Ä¶,Didn‚Äôt have to deal with much of this company. The down fall was a $10 charge to transfer an IRA to another account,1
I‚Äôve been waiting almost an hour,"Employer failed to notify me that my money was moving here, fee structure is not good and having to pay to recoup my money was ridiculous.",2
I completed all the document for‚Ä¶distribution,I tried for 3.5 years to pull my company 401k from them. I had to hire a broker to get my 401k money out so  I could earn interest. For 3 years they paid no interest.,1
Fees were always greater than returns,"Our IRA money was transferred to Millennium without our approval. It's been almost two months, at least a dozen phone calls (or phone call mazes), and we still haven't got access to our funds, or even found anyone at the company who knows where they are. Are they tying peoples' IRA money up in their own investments? Are they fundraising with it? And what's more, with hundreds of similar complaints posted on the BBB, the BBB rates them an A+. So, two winning companies. I'd like to give them both -5.",2
Un-freakin-satisfied,"The absolutely worst experience I've ever had trying to roll-over my 401k with a former employer.  Boarder-line fraudulent and I'm likely going to be contacting the authorities given the level of resistance, inaccurate steps, and number of iterations Millenium Trust has put up as I've attempted to roll-over my balance into a traditional IRA.",1

Took forever for funds to roll over‚Ä¶,"Waited on the phone 35 minutes to be able to speak to someone. Told to go online and download chrome because I use a Mac, after my download l could access my account. I completed my registration without downloading chrome. Trying now to get my account number so I can move my investment.",1
Confusing from start to finish,"Gave me no results on my retirement plan after 3 years. Website is to difficult to navigate, no app for easy use on my phone, to difficult to get a hold of company.",1
Your website was not easy to work with,The lady I talk to was short and unhappy she was on the call. She gave vague information directed me to the website. She was not customer service at all.,1
Violation of the 4th AMENDMENT!,"Simple question cannot be resolve with live chat, website or phone. Website is a mess! It‚Äôs like everything is thrown into one basket, there is no structure! This is the worst company I had to deal with.",2
Account updates and fees....terrible,"I have never had a worse experience in my life than I have had simply trying to get ANYONE on the phone so I can transfer MY MONEY from Millennium to Fidelity. I started calling them last Friday and here it is Wednesday.  I haveheld on the phone for hours, left my number in the queue  etc.   I am simply trying to print out my statement to transfer money. I will be moving EVERYThING away from them.  Absolutely the worst firm I have ever tried to work with.  Mike",2
Terrible company to work with,"was told i'd have my tax documents emailed to me within a day (for some reason they aren't available on the site, even though i've repeatedly logged out/in / refreshed etc)... 5 days later still waiting? Useless",1

A few weeks later Schwab called me and said the transfer had been declined until l contacted Millennium.  Called them back, been on hold for over 1/2 and hour...   Ridiculous.",2
The online platform is horrible and automated phone service isn't any better.,I was unable to provide passphrase. There is no hint to help with passphrase. The link I was provided to change passphrase locked my account out even though I was positive I entered the correct information. I submitted paperwork through mail and they weren‚Äôt able to tell my why I had to call to finish the transfer.,1

It took over 45 minutes just to register and I still don‚Äôt have a definitive idea as to when the funds will be returned to me. Frustrating to say the least. Don‚Äôt call the either, they‚Äôre rude and less than helpful when trying to figure out how to request a simple payout. They also try to say it will take an additional 20 days to do anACH transfer which is absurd, nothing takes that long anymore. It‚Äôs a stall tactic to keep their bank account fat for interest sweeps.",1

Two of the representatives that I‚Ä¶,All this company did was take my money in fees.  It went from almost 1000 to 589. They didnt make me any money and wouldn't transfer my money to another retirement.  So I just took it out.  Ridiculous!!,1

Called during hours and it said the best time to reach us is 5p-8p cst for now you‚Äôll have to talk to the robot and the robot couldn‚Äôt help.

Long delay to make a withdrawal of‚Ä¶,So many awkward and inadequate processes and communication failures over the past year. Immensely long wait times on the phone for more months that the pandemic justified. Lousy website. MT had poor communication with the holder of my metals and someone screwed up on a (test) distribution I made. Once I figured out things were not being handled well on either end I reluctantly decided to take a full distribution of the account which I would not have done but MT and the metals holder worked so poorly together.

Super complex to create an account and‚Ä¶,This company charged me $25 to close an account I didnt open. My previous company was supposed to send me my 401k directly but sent it here instead. Then they charged me $25 to get it from them. Scam.,2
"Is poor customer service, customer service?",Would not give me my own account number. Will not let me transfer my own money to my Fidelity account without jumping through a bunch of complex hoops that I do not understand. Can't access account or information without online access.

Took over 300$ from my account for fees,"My money was moved here by a previous employer I worked for which had closed.

They took quiet a chunk of my money considering they have done NOTHING to communicate with me regarding my funds or my investments. I‚Äôve received less than $1 in over a year being with them. They take a chunk of fees annually, but I have less than $1 dividends so they, in essence will eventually take ALL of my money if I stay with them. My opinion is if they are going to receive people retirement money and take a chunk from it then they need to be more proactive at communicating to those people about they money and how they can help with investments; otherwise, they have not earned those large fees they are so happy taking!No message has been received and communion should have happened prior to my account sitting for so long while only receiving less than $0.30 monthly in dividends.",1

An account was opened in my name‚Ä¶,"I've attempted 3x to set up account, verify email, etc...why do I have to do this multiple times? Just attempting to direct rollover to my new company",1
I still have not received my monies,"Don't trust the company. my 401k from my previous company was transferred to them. I've been trying to call them but you cannot talk personally to a customer support representative, all they have are recorded messages and directing you to their website which doesn't help since I need to talk to them directly and personally. This company is no good, It doesn't even deserve a one star rating. I would rate it a zero star if I could.",1
Not your customer service support,They steal your money! Stay away!!!,2
Rude phone agent - moved my money,"It took me over 5 months to even get a look at how much money I had in the account, an account established without my knowledge when the company I had worked for got sold...and the MT staff, while nice and courteous, were unable to assist me due to system issues.  5 months.  To even find out how much money I had in the account, much less get access.",1
I asked to cash out an account and have‚Ä¶,I was disappointed to have funds my employer put into Mass Mutual transferred to Millennium when I found there was a transfer fee and that  Millennium Millennium would be taking an annual fee. I had no choice in the matter and was not told in advance this would be happening.,2
You didn‚Äôt send what was requested,She was kind of rude and seemed like she did not want to be on the phone with me at all. I did get the answers I was seeking but did not feel welcome.,1
Poor customer service,Overcharging for a rollover and high fees,1
Response time is extremely slow,It was hard to reach a living voice and even harder to communicate needs once reached. While I know that I did not have a huge investment with Millennium it would have been nice to believe my investment was valued nonetheless.,1
Obtaining access to account was way too‚Ä¶,I had requested a distribution a couple days ago and had not even received an acknowledgement that they had received all my documents. I called today and the representative was rather short and curt. Basic business practice is to acknowledge that all materials had been received and give a timeline as to when to expect the distribution. Not good customer service.,1
not the easiest site to use and‚Ä¶,company managed my ira 4 years.lost money!! in this market.but never failed to assess in fees.,2
Had no info to give,"My last 401K contribution from a previous employer went here. I had trouble transferring it to my primary account so I kept it in Millennium Trust for 7 years. Little did I know they pay themselves $40 a year to keep it open. With the dips in the market, and probably bad investments I did not have a choice in, I lost $600 plus paid $10 to close the account. What an unfortunate retirement method. I think I will get $23 after taxes. Hope they enjoy my money!",1
I can't get into my account,Something simple to do over the phone. Force to do it online and all you get Something is not valid.,1
Unable to access multiple IRA‚Äôs,"How do I give ZERO stars? Millennium is failing/neglecting to release my transfer, essentially holding my funds against my wishes FOR NO REASON, as if it is their money and not MINE. How is it that an institution is permitted to hold my funds indefinitely, without providing any reason??????Update: Millennium's reply to the above is NOT TRUE, and even contrary to what they told me over the phone. So now they are posting lies on top of it, just to try and save face.",1
I received very poor customer service‚Ä¶,Millennium made me pay a percentage and my taxes up front when I gOt my 401k EARLY because I had to and they turned around and reported to the IRS that it was not taxed. That is Fraud!!!,1
Difficult to manage accounts and get‚Ä¶,"The repeated profession that they value your time is a total misrepresentation. The fact that their automated systems repeat this claim over and over again as you punch through to reach a true human being to request information that only that person has access to is proof that this company does not value your time at all. Too bad that companies such as this do not realize that automation is not the solution to all of their manpower needs. Once I did reach a human, I was able to pose my questions and obtained satisfactory answers. The person on the other end of the line was polite, responsive to my questions and was quick to find the answers to the questions I posed.",2
Bad service,Always an issue with everything I need done. Takes forever. Always sit on hold for at least 25 minutes. Very bureaucratic.,2
Worst service ever- Fraud/ scam,I can not access my account!!  And‚Ä¶Very slow process.,1
Not able to speak to a representative,The rep put me on hold on the phone and never got back to me never did I receive a call back to solve my problem I was having. Bad customer service.,1
I would give 0 stars if I could,"Tried to talk to rep via the phone, after they harvested all of my personal info, they would not verify if I even had an account. I believe their phone bank could be a phishing entity for identity theft.",1
So many problems... I am done with MT.,nice people but no help to solve problems they said just keep calling back,1
No Trust in Millennium,"The service guy was ok. But the phone tree tries like crazy to get you to work online, and not talk to a human.  The website never did work.  I was no closer to getting help after an hour on the phone.",1
I was given inaccurate info by a‚Ä¶,I had a roll over and it was never invested in anything and they charged over $75 in fees to keep it in a money market account. You can't get through to anybody.,2
Account fees are insane.,Really rude person . I was really amazed the way he spoke to me . Don‚Äôt remember he‚Äôs name . No happy . But I guess I have to deal with it .,1
If I could give this company 0 stars I‚Ä¶,"I had received a letter from this company telling me it has the money form a company I worked at. When I wanted to TIAA to have control and move if from this company to TIAA, it was noted it was in a 403(b)-plan due to it was a university. However, no one from MT noted that MT changed the account I have in the 403(b) to a Traditional IRA and took $35 for a fee. TIAA sent me 3 letters telling me MT would not transfer the money. When I called MT, they said that TIAA was seeking a 403(b)plan and it is now a Traditional IRA and I asked who decided this and why has no one contacted of this. It finally got cleared up, but very disappointed with the LACK of communication where TIAA would not be able to get the account since I had to claim the account. Again, no one told me I had to claim my money. Assine the entire process and lacks professionalism the company and its processes. On 3/16/2022, Myra called me and now tells me, there is MORE confusion, how can this be Myra? You are the one who explained me to have TIAA change the verbiage of 403(B) to Traditional IRA in the transfer form which we did. The paperwork should be coming to MT next week so the Traditional IRA can be moved finally to TIAA.  Apparently, the 403(B) money was dropped into MT in December 2021 by the University, and I am hearing about this now?",1
Not wasting my time to write a review,Person on phone was nice but I was not able to complete the task. Website is confusing. Don't recommend.,1
My second account is still not‚Ä¶,"Automated Customer Service.I am not pleased with the automated customer service available on the telephone.

My money was moved over on 3-14 and‚Ä¶,"The person I spoke to in regards to the account transfer seems like he doesn't have enough knowledge,",1
Waited on the phone for over an hour,"Initial agent I spoke to was rude and highly unprofessional. She interrupted and cut me off multiple times and would assert her comment without hearing or allowing me to speak. The most unpleasant conversation I‚Äôve had. The initial rep should not be in customer service and she needs more training on how to have a basic conversation with a customer to in depth training about tax forms. She gave us inaccurate and incorrect information. She transferred me to a supervisor eventually. The supervisor (Joanna) was gracious, kind and understood the situation at hand. Promptly resolved the issue.",1
My experience with this company has‚Ä¶,The customer service rep I had sounded tired and irritated with my questions. It‚Äôs like I had to try really hard to get information out of him.

It is very hard to get a hold of‚Ä¶,My questions was not answeredWaiting for replyJanet was good but could not help me.Been waiting for weeks to fix the problem,1
Millennium Trust customer service subpar,The user interface is the worst i have used of all financial sites. They have basically no customer service and tons of hidden fees. Do yourself a favor and take your money elsewhere.,1
Terrible Experience - Go Elsewhere,I am very frustrated that with this day and age a more established online platform is not accessible. Online transactions are more and more common and I feel that MTC needs to catch up!,1
I've been on the phone with you‚Ä¶,Hard to get help and it was harder to get set up. Just wanted my money to work for me so now I‚Äôm changing to an Roth account instead with someone else.,1
Extremely frustrating,Having trouble with distributing my account. Was told the problem would be fixed in 3 business days. It has been 2 weeks and nothing has been resolved.,1
You charge more fees then money is made.,I NEED TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE GIVE ME THAT OPTION INSTEAD OF GIVING ME A VIRTUAL ASSISTANT EVERY TIME I CALL. I NEED HELP!,1
It‚Äôs my money I should be able to buy‚Ä¶,Took 3 days to get a statement! Not helpful and the process is overly complicated. 100% would not recommend  I am only dealing with then to move money a previous employer moved to them. Avoid at all costs,2
No notifications or communication,Your company uses people money as an interest free fund. Your company does not provide any service (No one from Millennium Trust ever called me or get in touch with me through mail or email).,1
what a circus of word salads.,They charge more in fees than I make interest.  I am trying to contact them via phone to transfer my IRA to a bank with no fees. Twenty minutes later...no answer. Unacceptable,1
this company operates as a scam,I have an account that was rolled over to Millennium. I want to warn everyone that if you need to call them about anything they put you on hold and forget about you. I've been trying to complete a transaction they said I need to voice verify but have been on hold over the last 3 days for over 6 hours. This company is a joke.,1
Not been able to connect to a‚Ä¶,My problem is not so much with the company as the customer service. This is an account which I had totally forgotten about until I received an email about it. I had forgotten my password and requested a reset. Response was that I would receive an email with a link to do so. Never received it. Resorted to calling them on several occasions and was on hold for 45 minutes to no avail. This has happened over the course of about a week and a half with no resolve,1
Could not get agent after 5 or 6‚Ä¶,"Poor communication, not set up to work with other banks and investment firms",1

Terrible experience with the website‚Ä¶,"I understand that the customer service line can be quite difficult, but the person on the phone was not exactly the nicest. The website also made me go in circles to determine if/when I can roll over my account to a different account.",1
I gave a 1 star simply because their‚Ä¶,This is perhaps the worst account opening experience EVER,1
Milluim bank your service is not good‚Ä¶,While I was asking questions she hung up on me.,1
Fees are unreasonably high,I took my money out due to low reruns and high fees,1
Awful company that charges account fees‚Ä¶,I needed to talk to a person none of the options met my needs.,1
Horrible customer service,I called to advise that I can't access my account online because the email address for my account no longer exists and that I wanted to close out my account.  I gave the rep my new email address and she said she would email the authorization form for the withdrawal to me.  I never received it and my email address was not updated on my account so I still can't access my account online.,1
Terrible communication,The phone representative had a bad attitude and didn‚Äôt want to answer any questions. I will find a different company and move my money over.,1
Shady business practices,The process of transfer is manual and required me to call in to know the status of my transfer out request. I am stunned that you guys take 15 business days to process a transfer out request. Equally stunning is that this is a manual process. I am extremely unhappy with Millennium Trust company.,1
Would not give me my own account‚Ä¶,"To Whom It May Concern,I had a very disappointing experience working with Millennium Trust. I asked for a roll over of my retirement money to be done between Millennium Trust and another institution, in order to avoid handling a check with a large value. I was told that it is possible to do so. I followed their instructions and filled a out paper request and notarized signatures. It was time and energy consuming. Millennium Trust did not acknowledge receiving my paperwork. When I called to follow up, I realized that they had everything but just failed to mail the check. In the end, instead of mailing the check to the other institution they mailed it to my house, doing the exact thing I tried to avoid. I wasted almost 3 months and the result is profoundly unsatisfactory. I had one of the worst experiences working with Millennium Trust. In my opinion, they are unprofessional, to say the least.",1
poor customer service,"Excessive fees. I originally tried to access this account months ago. Ran into a very unfriendly customer service agent. I now understand why this company, Millennium Trust, has so many negative reviews online.",1
Very unsatisfied with their ‚Äúservice‚Äù!,"I tried closing this account after millennium trust applied all my funds to account fees. I was able to recover a very small amount of my money and thought I was done with this company. Unfortunately, somehow my account was not closed and somehow they found a way to continue charging me account fees. I wish the company I worked for never invested my money into this account.",1
They don't anwer phone till half hour‚Ä¶,This firm f%*king sucks. My employer's IRA plan was through them and it's an awful experience. So many fees and they do not let you choose your investment fund. Once I quit they failed to notify me they started charging me additional account fees and they were so hefty I wound up losing 45% of my account contribution value and cashed out the IRA early with the IRS penalty to avoid them. F*#k Millenium. The reviews here speak for themselves. NEVER trust these b*stards with your money. They will take every penny. Use Vanguard or Charles Schwab instead!Update:I have been contacted about having these fees refunded. If this is the case in the next few business days I will be updating this review as that would be a major step in the right direction and a positive outcome to this experience.,1
Unable to access account,Horrible experience my money was put into a ira from my previous employer and I was never contacted. Until 13 plus years later after they took all my money and I had nothing left.,2
It's been 3 weeks,Get your retirement rolled over to another company as soon as possible! For over a month I have received a message when trying to sign in that I need to secure my account by confirming my phone number. When I ask to receive the code the only two ways available an error message pops up stating that the action cannot be completed by millennium trusts website‚Ä¶ really professional. Customer service is very unfriendly even when you are an understanding person and treat them with the utmost respect. I hope I can finally rollover my account soon.,1
I've attempted 3x to set up account,Just fees fees fees and sucked my account dry. What a scam.,1
Don't trust the company,1 hour call wait then all the guy could do was ask me if my internet was working when his web page would not load on Chrome Firefox or edge I simply asked if he could fax a statement to a real Ira company and after 15 minutes of demanding something other than his broke website he only agreed to email a pdf to me which did not have all the info I needed on it,1
They steal your money,"I was having trouble getting started. The company that I had worked for had given a wrong date of birth. Now, I did not know that so I was trying to login as a new user and it kept giving me a 'wrong information' error. I looked for a number to call. Called that number and I got no where. I did the online chat..none of the options helped me. I became very frustrated and closed the chat. That was back in January. I really needed to get this taken care of so I tried again, in March. Again, the number was of no use. I sent an email. I then tried the online chat. Went thru all the options, again none were helping me. Finally, I typed in help and FINALLY..i was ""chatting"" with a person. Her name was Terri. Thank goodness for Terri. She was able to find the problem and she sent me a link to correct the problem. I gave a low rating because it took me h.o.u.r.s! to just find a way to contact a live person. I feel like adding ""chat with an agent"" should be an options on both the chat and phone.As for Terri, she is definitely a five star employee. She was wonderful!",1

I was told if I had questions to call but it took me so long to get a response that calling is insane. So, I was told I could email but that I would not get any information regarding my account specofically despite what information I could provide over email. It's just ridiculous I have never been more frustrated trying to get through to a company.",2
I was disappointed to have funds my‚Ä¶,My account was transferred from a tiaa account where it was making money to millennium.  It was not making any money and was subject to high fees. I was not very happy with losing so much money.  It also took 2 tries for my financial advisor and I to get it transferred out.,1
Extremely hard to get in contact with.,"One of the things that is extremely difficult about working with Millennium Trust is that everything sounds like a scam--from the letters you get in the mail to the people who call your phone asking for you personal information.  They also make it a very big hassle just to create an account online.   When I get calls from people there, I'm asked for my name, birthdate, address, last four of my SSN just to confirm my identity.  But I have no way to confirm that I'm actually getting a call from Millennium Trust.  I attempted a few times to tell them I don't share that information when somebody calls me and told them I would call back using a number on the Millennium Trust website. This just ended with me getting stuck in an endless loop of a phone system that doesn't want to actually get me in touch with somebody; it just repeats over and over again that I need to make an account online.  Which I can't do without providing an unreasonable amount of personal information to someone over the phone apparently.At one point after having to verify all that  information with someone who had called my phone, I was asked to email the company a copy of my driver's license.  I've been trying to make an online account with them for a while now and figure it's my only option.  But this definitely felt like it might be a scam.  And is not a great way for me or the company to protect my personal information.I think if Millennium Trust allowed you to create an account on their website before linking you to the account with the money, it would solve some of this problem.  That way documents could be uploaded to the website on your account, you definitely wouldn't need to email anyone a copy of your driver's license, forms could be approved or not approved through the account, and nobody from the company would need to call you.",1
She was kind of rude and seemed like‚Ä¶,Got card can't activate it ! Phone numbers provided are bogus as well as the websites and apps! Total scam!!!!,2
Overcharging for a rollover and high‚Ä¶,Not apart of ACATS so it takes forever to transfer out.,1
Disappointed,Never will I recommend this company to a person. They will take your money in seconds then make you wait weeks to maybe get it back and if your in  emergency they will stall and delay and make you feel air and not give a thought about you. They‚Äôll let you go homeless and loose you car while saying it takes 15 businesses days to get you your money back even tho you bank with a company that it a partner company. Horse poop company and will never put a penny into it company again!!!!,2
Still waiting on tax return paper,"the customer service is terrible, I have an account and I was talking so that they would not charge me for the maintenance of the account and even if I filled out the form they always charged me for the maintenance of the papers, I called customer service and they told me you do not have a user account and I always had one and then they tell me the system changed and they never told me anything?  and they always charged the maintenance bad company I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT",1
Lack of customer service,"Working with their online agent was a nightmare. The agent was not accurately reading what I was writing, was intrusive on my rights as a client,  and gave me incorrect information. I will be transferring my assets out of millennium trust ASAP due to this interaction.Also in response to the below response from MTrust. This response perfectly illustrates how you do not listen. Why would you call my cell phone when I made it explicitly clear to your agent (in a well documented conversation) that my phone is NOT WORKING and I cannot use it. Thus why would you contact me via the phone and then recommend me to call you. It's absolutely amazing the incompetence level",1

The rep put me on hold on the phone and‚Ä¶,My former company rolled my account over to you without my permission. I sent paperwork directing them to roll over to another company. So I have been charged an annual fee of $30.00 without my knowledge or permission.

Call wait long,The worst customer service experience I've ever had.  Trying to have my IRA transferred has been a huge hassle.  They claim to never receive any of my forms so that they can continue to charge their exorbitant fees. I can't wait until I dont have to deal with them any longer.,1

The email did not help and has only put me back at square one.  All done to intentionally making it difficult to get away from them.  No wonder they have only 1/5 stars from the BBB.,1

To hard to talk to a real person.,"My 401k rolled over to them after I left my previous employer. All they do is charge fees and nickel and dime you but do absolutely nothing with your funds. They don't reach out to you to see if you have questions. They do absolutely nothing other than charge ridiculous fees while your account earns $1 or so, if you're lucky. Happy to be moving it over to a place that will actually invest it for me and  help me grow it rather than taking it all for themselves.Edit to respond to their response: That doesn't change the fact that Millennium does nothing but nickel and dime their customers to provide ZERO service. Still glad I am moving away from them.",2
Person did not listen,"I have been with Millennium for about 10 years.  For many years they were great and had wonderful customer service and response time.  However, MTC, like just about every other company in the US that isn't a mom and pop organization, have gone to the default model of not hiring adequate staff.  I have needed to contact them twice in the last few days, and have waited on hold in excess of 45 minutes on both occasions.  This is not on customer service people but on management.  To my way of thinking, wait times of over 15 minutes are absolutely unacceptable.  HIRE SOME MORE PEOPLE!!!",1

My problem is not so much with the‚Ä¶,"This company took over the 401k after a former employer decided to use them. By the time this happened, I had already resigned from my position and moved to another state to attend graduate school. The Millennium Trust Company sent a letter to my former address informing me that my money had been moved to them. After years of NO REPLY from me, no one from this company thought it best to try to reach out to me by any other form. No one searched for a death certificate or anything to know why I was not responding. Worst, while the money was sitting here for about 4 years, they were taking ""admin charges"" or ""maintenance charges"" from the little money that I had no idea was with this company. My money had been sitting at this company for years and by the time I got a letter on the off-chance I returned to my previous address just a few weeks ago, I learned that the money that had originally been with the company had dwindled to roughly 1/2 of the original amount because of the fees they were charging for just holding my money, not even investing it or doing anything with it. No one decided to track me down via any other means except by letter, which was being sent to my parent's address, where I had not lived in years! If this were the other way around and I OWED this company money, I would get calls, emails, and all other forms of communication from this  company so they could recoup their funds. This company preys on the unresponsive nature of their ""clients"" in order to steal from them! I WILL MAKE SURE TO NEVER RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY TO ANYONE. ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.",1

My money is still not transferred to my‚Ä¶,"I understand ‚Äúbad‚Äù is the option I selected. I wish there was a selection worse than bad. I am in disbelief in the level of accountability this company and its representatives have in helping the consumer. I was told by a supervisor Yesenia P. that it was MY responsibility and the organization does not bare a fiduciary responsibility to the customers because the account was transferred to Millennium Trust from my previous employer. There was no attempt to empathize or understand the situation from the customer viewpoint. I understand parameters and guidelines are created for the best interest of the company, but the customer loses when there are charges put an account every year for 10 years without the customers knowledge nor authorization. I will never do business with a company that values their bottom line and forgoes the customer experience. Maybe losing one more customer does not impact you but the treatment I have received will have a lasting impression on me, my family and every person I tell this story to.Update: when I titled this review as ‚ÄúDisingenuous Representatives‚Äù I was referring to the few that I have come in contact with. After speaking with the manager Mike P, I am beginning to think that is the culture of Millennium Trust. Mike P. did not reach out to me to provide help, he wanted to further explain why the company is justified in charging me hundreds of dollars. The justification was: 1) address search they conducted (hard to believe when information is readily available with today‚Äôs technology), 2) having the ability to access my account online (even though I never used the service), and 3) the funds were held in their institution (even though I am responsible in managing my own account for any gain). The most insulating part of the conversation is when he offered to waive my fees to close my account. I am not aware of any financial institution that charges $20 because they can not send you a statement, $40 annually because the funds are sitting in an account they do not manage, and $25 to close the account.  The intent of this organization is to deplete the account by any means available. Per Mike P. they will keep charging fees until the account is at a zero balance. This organization doesn‚Äôt seem to have an escheatment process, it charges fees until there is no funds left. Why would anyone want to be a customer when their intent is clear.",1
You keep trying to send a text to a‚Ä¶,"These guys are a royal waste of money. They did absolutely nothing except take money in fees.

Word of advice: Take your money out and open an account with Robinhood, WeBull, ETrade, etc and put your money in an EFT (if you're uncomfortable investing in individual companies). Mutual funds are managed by a person and you will be charged fees. An EFT is managed by an AI and there are no fees.

The worst customer service experience‚Ä¶,"This has been the most disappointing experience I‚Äôve encountered in all of my financial dealings.

Recently I‚Äôve had the experience of dealing with the New York Life Annuities Group and was truly treated professionally, equipped at every juncture to access what was mine, and then offered investment options for consideration. And truthfully they were dealing with over 300,000.00 rather than a mere 1600.00. Night and day is what I would call this experience. The customer service was professional, personable, helpful at every turn with even a follow up two days later to be sure I was pleased with their service and the outcome of my decisions (NY Annuities Group)   And then compare the pervious to this‚Ä¶from the Millennium Group:    The response was simply all of our processing is done online and we don‚Äôt have the ability to help you (Milllenium group).

Millennium Trust Company is terrible,The fees are often and high. I never wanted to do business here it was an ira rollover from a previous employer. No one should willing want to do business with a company who wants to fee their customers to death.  Even to close account yet another fee. They should be investigated and no one should do business with them. Called to talk to someone its 100% automated and to transfer funds takes forever you have to do it online only. This place needs to go out of business. Hope people files complaints with the district attorneys.  I see the same reply about fees to all. That's why I roll everything to etrade no BS fees like this scam company. They only want to charge fees and suck you dry look at the reviews over and over and over again.,1

Terrible Company with Predatory Nature!,"I was new to Millennium Trust because an account with a former employer was rolled over to them.  I appreciated TMT's diligence in reaching me about this account. Once they found me it took several months to get my account open due to some technical glitch and reps kept sending me the same non working solution.  When I was able to reach a person, several months later I was talked into how to solve the glitch and that was great customer service.  I then received another communique about stuff I had to do to verify the opening of my account. Annoying. Did that. Get into my account to see the amount that's been rolled over.  Too small to leave with MTM, BUT I loved how the site worked once inside. Decide to get distribution of that amount but want to keep the TMT for other funds I'd load later in the year.  Getting the distribution, which I want to invest elsewhere I have to leave $200 in or forced to close the account.  I don't like that, decide to take the full  distribution. TMT charges me $25 to close the account I'm forced to close! That feels predatory....Dang, thought this company would be a strong solution to other funds I want to invest.  NOT going to happen because, in the end of all things, too difficult to access and sign up for funds they have told me are in their holdings for me, then too difficult to keep a relationship that I would have wanted with the company going.

Functional UI but dated look & feel,You directly stated in a phone call you made to me that you would waive the $10 close account fee as a courtesy due to the small account balance.  You told me this at 2:30 pm. I closed the account at 8 pm the same day. The next day the account close fee of $10 was taken. A complete lack of integrity by Millennium Trust.,2

After the transfer of the company,"I am retired and live full time in La Paz bcs Mexico.I have no ties in the USA.

Also there was Zero follow up after I was finally approved.I had no idea I had completed the paperwork correctly until the wrong dollar amount showed up in my Bank account.I was told by the last representative that she would call me back in 1/2 hour to update me on what was going on.

You are welcome for my small contribution to your wealth.,It is impossible to get a to a live person. My previous employer transferred my account against my wished even though I had already requested disbursement through previous company. Then in order to have my account opened and closed within a few minutes I was charged both an annual fee as well as an account closing fee. This is ridiculous. There was no work or effort done. I had your account for a total of 5 minutes yet you justify taking $55 out of my money for what exactly. This is a total joke and would never even considering investing with you guys. Apart from that tried to use your customer chat which is not a chat. It is is simply a commonly asked questions search. Then emailed your company 3 separate times and have yet to receive a single response yet it says you will contact same day or at latest 24-48 hours later. Horrible service,1

It appeared they hired specifically trained people to work to not make this happen, and to make it so difficult to move money out of their company that the customer would just give up.

All in all, I made the mistake of keeping my money there for so long, and no one bothered to reach out to me, to at least guide me to use your services and have us both make money.

To be clear about the ""it's your responsibility"" line - My old company made no efforts to contact me at my updated addresses to let me know that this was being done, and MTC took their sweet time finding me as well despite all my address changes being a matter of public record with the postal service. MTC operates fully within the broad auspices of finance law, but that doesn't mean their service is worth using or that their business practices will benefit you in any way, shape, or form. My review stands. This company's purpose for existing is to buy up 401ks from lazy employers and to skim fees off busy people.",2
I was not able to log into my account ‚Ä¶,Millennium received my 401k from another company that was supposed to send my funds to me.

I should have pulled my money out the minute it was transferred from TIAA,"Ridiculous and painful, frankly.  It appears obvious as to why you drag people through such a tedious and arduous process but I suppose you don't care a single iota while you sit back and collect fees (penalties) while the accounts sit idle.   Most people, myself included, don't have time to deal with the process, especially for such a minimal amount that we either dismiss it or eventually get around to it when we receive a year end statement, in my case this has been sitting in your account for 3 years. I suspect you all sleep well at night.  Sleep tight :-)",1
Have tried calling customer service‚Ä¶,"The company over charges in fees $45.00 a year on a account that makes $1.45 in interest. That's a total loss of $43.55 a year, they are a worthless investment company when you actually run the numbers.",1

My money was transferred from my‚Ä¶,"re; Robert Sundeen Millennium Trust account #1v73REF753679.  Please request Millennial Trust contact me at 1847-927-3100 regarding the reason for my calls placed today. Extremely important.Called the 630-386-5600 twice today.  This morning, first time calling was on hold listening to your sales pitch for around 30 minutes.  Then I chose to leave a voicemail then was told I would get a call back.  That never happened.So I called back at 3 PM CST, 4 EST.  Once again, I am on hold so far for 40 minutes, then requested a call back. That is terrible service.  I need to speak only with a person who issues the 1099-R for account holders.   I received, incorrectly,, a 1099-R showing $136,067.50 a distribution for tax reporting.  When in fact no $ funds where distributed in that amount.  I simply had Cytometix issue a stock certificate equal to the number of shares of Cytometix stock that Millennium Trust had been holding in my account.  So no transaction took place.  Once Cytometix company advised Millennium Trust that that had issued a stock certificate to me, my account was then closed. I need Millennium Trust tax / accounting department to send a new ""corrected"" or reverse the 1099-R for no distribution of funds took place.  Instead at my request, Cytometix company contacted Millennial Trust to let it know that they were issuing a stock certificate for the amount of my share holding.   So no 1099-R is required since no transaction or funds distribution took place through Millennium Trust.   I am holding the stock certificate that was issued by Cytometix.  Unfortunately there is no market for selling my shares, which make them actually worthless.I did also receive 1099-R for cash, $236.36, that was in my Millennial Account.  When I closed my account Millennium Trust sent me a check for   $236.36.  The 1099-R is correct.",1

The wait times for customer service has‚Ä¶,"The reason I closed the account was because of all of the service fees attached with the account. How can you justify charging me to hold my money? I had well over $200 in my account when my account was handed over to you and by the time I checked again and withdrew you took more than your share of MY money that I busted my ass for. So much for the word ""trust"".",2
Made it all but impossible to get my‚Ä¶,My former employer sent my funds to them and I still haven't been able to excess the portal to view my funds. Called 3 times already.,1
"Nice, but Ineffective",Ridiculously hard to communicate with. System glitches make it impossible to self-service.,2
Joke,It was I couldn‚Äôt even get anyone on the phone and I still have yet to receive my withdraw from your  company it‚Äôs been close to over a week.,1
Vert difficult to talk to a real‚Ä¶,"Too hard to contact a live person, don't have all day nor access to my computer to sit around waiting for a call back.",1
customer service person was very rude‚Ä¶,"I haven't been able to open an account. I have zero information on how to do it and supposedly the long call I had was to fix that. I was supposed to wait for an email to let me know about some approval, but I'm still waiting.",1
Fees are outrageous,I've been trying to close my acct but Ive been given the run around on the phone and online,1
I woukd like to transfer my money to my‚Ä¶,"Was on hold for awhile, then was told there was a flag on my account and tonhold while it was cleared. I ended up being transferred to someone else who gave me the exact same information.",1
I‚Äôm just bitter that I got charged an‚Ä¶,You have to jump through hoop after hoop to get your money after waiting on hold on the phone you get told to do it online which is fine until you receive error messages prompting you to call again and wait on hold for another 20  plus minutes to just get told that their programs don‚Äôt communicate with safari well‚Ä¶ then to find a friend to use their computer instead of your own iPad or iPhone just to be told you have to print off more paper work and turn that in by mail before they will process your request don‚Äôt waste your time with this company i would not recommend them to anyone if you ever want to see your money it‚Äôs a joke,1
I called few weeks back and used‚Ä¶,ive been trying to withdrawal money from a traditional ira for 3 days now and at first my account kept on freezing as i was trying to verify my phone number. then i couldnt get through to anyone on the phone. the automated responses dont reconize anything i say and twice it just hung up on me. terrible service,2
I had to call back twice about my‚Ä¶,I‚Äôm mad because your group couldn‚Äôt care less about the people who have to use this company.,2
I have been contacting your company for‚Ä¶,"When calling in to learn about processes such as depositing new checks into my account, and the requirements to withdrawal funds from my account, I was given false information multiple times. What should have been handled in 2 phone calls to the company, was more like 5 or 6. The staff is not trained and some are truly not professional. I spoke to one person who actually took their time to learn what needed to be done. I won‚Äôt be using this company again.",1
I was told I would get my money in 5 to‚Ä¶,I login to Millennium Trust with my user name / password and it appears to log me in then its asking me for for my user name  / password again and will not allow me to login. I am at a loss for words about my displeasure with the login process and have had someone try to help and they do not understand why it will not work for me because it works for them. I would prefer my money be transferred to my Vanguard account.,2
Waited for a call back,"Your fees are ridiculous!  You charged 10 dollars for a paper invoice, 40 dollars for the account and 25 dollars just to close the account.Their response is the customer service you will get with this horrible company. Get your money out as quickly as possible!",1
I have not gotten my money back and I‚Ä¶,Tried to access my account on the website and the site froze. Called in and used the call back feature only to miss the call. Called again and tried to do the call back feature and never received a call. Poor service and I hope they improve on it.,1
Was never able to even register due to‚Ä¶,35 minute wait to chat online. Tried to address failed email for password reminder/reset but no email sent. No help with online access through chat after waiting 35 minutes. Total breakdown in their assistance.,1
Excessive fees all over,"Incredibly difficult to access my accounts online, speak to anyone, or figure out why my money keeps disappearing.",1
not helpful in the least.,My 401k was sent to this company from Capitol Group without my knowledge. Capital Group is terrible too but this company charged me to have my money in their account and to withdraw it . Thanks for nothing,1
I‚Äôve reset my password and now it‚Äôs‚Ä¶,Very poor service.Very poor revice,1
Can't get to a live person to answer my‚Ä¶,"My previous employer rolled over 2 amounts of money and it was put into 2 accounts. Makes no sense to me, but thats how it shows up. I took out one account, but the other is still there. Once the money from the first account hit my bank I tried to take out the remaining funds I had. I'm not able to do so because millennium trust says I have to have an active account. I don't want to have an active account with them. I just want to take my money out, but no one seems to be able to help. They just send me the instructions that I read up on before I emailed them for help. All I want is my money.",1
I requested a refund of account fees‚Ä¶,I still do not know where my money is being sent or when.   Will it be a check?  Will it go into my bank account directly?   Do you have my correct California and not Washington address?,1
Contact difficulties,"My account was moved to Millennium Trust with no notification. I received no statements, no mailings, nor emails. Poorly ran firm.",2
0 stars,I was so disappointed with Millennium.  Fees for everything and I decided finally to just cut my losses and rollover.,1
I called to get help and I was directed‚Ä¶,"Complicated hoops to jump through, you have to pay fees to do anything, confusing website with unclear terminology and a clunky UI.",2
Phone tree is awful- doesn‚Äôt answer‚Ä¶,The customer service was absolutely wonderful however the complicated system you have in place in transferring funds is beyond barable please look at your policies!,1
I was on hold for 3 hrs,I am trying to withdraw my funds and the website does not work.  When I called they put me on hold and hung up on me.,1
Most difficult thing I‚Äôve dealt with,"The CSR was very nice.  That said, no one followed up with me.",1
Had a few hundred dollars,I would like to close my account and cannot get anyone to help me ?,1
My 401K was moved here by a previous‚Ä¶,Your website became unresponsive while registering with the site. I called the 877 number and it finally started working.  Nothing is more frustrating than a registration process that crashes in three different browsers.,1
Payout still has not been received,"My previous employer had my retirement funds sent here and since it was a small balance of about $300 I decided to just leave it alone. One day recently I decided to look into my funds only to find out I was being charged $40 annually for maintaining an open account with a very minimal return on my IRA that I lost about $200! To make things worse, the little money I had left was charged another $10 fee just to close the account.",1
Hefty fees and no communication,"One of the most expensive rip off financial companies I have ever encountered.  Your fees are ridiculous.  You make your website so cryptic and information unavailable.  Try to reach a live person for help is a joke.  So glad to have removed our funds from your company.Update 1/21/2022: I received your reply to my review.  Thank you.  I see you acknowledged you have fees associated with each account.  What you failed to acknowledge is how ridiculously high the fees are in comparison to other companies.  Not to mention how difficult you make it to request a disbursement.  We did not choose you...our previous employer did.  Thus, the ""benefit"" was to you for being able to bleed your clients account with such high fees.  Again, I am GLAD to have removed our funds from your company to a new funds manager.",1
My money lost value and your UI/UX did‚Ä¶,My tiny IRA was rolled over to Millenium Trust from an old job. When I got the information to check the account I was disappointed to see the huge fees being charged to maintain the account. The fees were so large that the amount in the account was actually shrinking.,1
