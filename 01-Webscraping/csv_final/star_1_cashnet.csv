This company is a company that takes advantage of people in this country when it is struggling enough. These type of companies should be force regulated by the government. They should be outlawed,This company is a company that takes advantage of individuals. It charges the highest rate possible on daily interest. You can only hope they get ran out of business by reasonable companies that offer fair and affordable rates. BestEgg offers actual companies with normal loans. This place is operated like a check writing service. Do not use them. I got a $1500 loan and my first 3 payments will add up to $1300 then I will be expected to continue payments until April of 2024.,1
THIS IS A TOTAL RIP OFF TO ME,THIS IS A TOTAL RIP OFF TO ME! IN JULY I GOT A LOAN OF $900. THEY DO A DIRECT WITHDRAWAL FROM MY ACCOUNT BI-WEEKLY WHEN I AM PAID. THEY HAVE TAKE OUT OF ATLEAST 6 OF MY CHECK. EANGING FROM $100-$160. WHY SHOULD I STILL HAVE A BALANCE OF $825? WHY MUST INTEREST CHARGES KEEP ADDING UP IF I AM ON A PAYMENT PLAN WITH THEM BI-WEEKLY?? AN ABSOLUTE RIP OFF!! NEVER AGAIN WILL I EVER DEAL WITH THEM OR RECOMMEND ANYONE TO THEM!!,1
Called cashnet USA today as they…,Called cashnet USA today as they requested about the 300% interest rates. They won't work with you except to extend payments or split them getting you farther and farther into debt as they continue to collect that high interest. It's like $14 a day!!!!  Being on social Security and elderly doesn't mean anything to them. Companies like this force you into bankruptcy.  I have a $2500 loan with another on line company and payments are not even half that.  All I can say is I would highly recommend against borrowing from this company.,1
A valuable lesson here.,"CashNetUsa has taught me a very important lesson--make sure you read all the fine print before you make a deal. About a month ago I borrowed $1500 and was hit with an automatic withdrawal payment of over $350 for my first payment. Now I have a $430+ payment due and owe a total of over $1700.. The key to doing business with this company is to be able off your entire bill before the first payment is due, otherwise you will hand out money until you run out of it completely.",1
I won't be using yall again after I get…,I won't be using yall again after I get yall paid off because it's impossible  to pay yall back in payments.  I don't make enough money to pay it all back at one time and every time I make a payment even if it's over what I owe on that statement by the time I make another payment it's like I haven't paid anything,1
I don’t like the fact that it takes…,I don’t like the fact that it takes days for my payment to post which appears as if I’ll never paid it off unless the scheduled payment plus additional monies is paid too!! It deters you from having an available balance to draw from and it appears the payment isn’t getting paid down.,2
Beware,"Beware! CashNet are always there when you need it. However, be careful! The loan docs don't say how much you will be paying each payment until you get approved and the money is already on the way. I personally used them a few years ago and again just a few months ago with no change in how they do business. Payments are super high (car payment) for the first few months and then get lower to where you can afford it. It is not a steady payment plan where you can budget. I have it listed under ""last resort"" when I need a loan because of this. Beware!",2
I've been making my payments on time,"I've been making my payments on time, every time, but I haven't gotten an increase in a very long time.",2
I never had a problem with this company…,"I never had a problem with this company until now. I advise no one to do business with this company and I will make sure it does get told across advertisements. The second to last customer service’s rep provided misleading information. I have the app installed on my phone, can access any funds at any time. There was a low balance to pay on my account but if I need more I can get more. But before completing my process through the app wanted to make sure I was able to afford the payment’s. Spoke with the guy he explain he can’t provide the exact amount but will not exceed over $350. Because we want to make sure people are able to pay back their loan. So after he explained the information and looking over my I account. Completed everything through the app. Then new bill cycle generated check the portal my damn payments almost $400 dollars. If the guy would have provided correct information I would never pushed forward. So after seeing the information in the portal I contacted customer services. The lady explained she apologize for the misleading information she can split the payment up. I can’t do that every time this is ridiculous I will go further to push this matter even if I have take it to court. All calls are recorded so they will have play back the information on those days I contacted customer services.",1
Your Interest Rates seem Illegal,"Your Interest Rates seem Illegal. I know you lend Money to People with Poor Credit Scores, but It's a Huge burden to those of Us that have suffered big set backs.",1
The interest rate is compiled daily and…,The interest rate is compiled daily and is high as hell. As a first time loan applicant I will never use this company again. I don't have a.problem paying the loan back but every payday more of the money is going towards interest than the actual loan,1
"Don't be asking me about how y'all are messing over people, but we need it",People can't catch up with themselves because of the money y'all charge,2
Nothing everything went well,Don't ever use a place like this. You will be struggling more then before. They say we work with you. HAHA NO they do not. Thank goodness after a couple months I was able to pay my balance off in full. Because let me tell you. I would've owed on this for the next 2 years. And I was paying 200 every 2 weeks. Places like this should be illegal. It's disgusting.,1
Don't ever use a place like this,"DO NOT USE CASH NET USA, After my account was paid in full, they drafted an additional $617, stated I would receive my funds, however, the funds have not been deposited and I am accumulating overdraft fees. This company is not reputable!!  BEWARE!!!!",1
DO NOT USE CASH NET USA,No matter how much you borrow everyday your balance goes up that’s not fair at all. The banks don’t even do that,1
I don’t think I’ll ever borrow from them again,They're taking advantage of the poor over charging 275% interest rate.,1
They're taking advantage of the poor…,I hated it even tho it was easy to get the money. The price was too high for the little money i borrowed. I even doubled up on some payments and still was charged all those fees for borrowing 600 bucks. Not worth it id never borrow from cash net usa ever again,1
I hated it even tho it was easy to get…,Payments and interest way too high!! They don't properly inform you of what you're getting into. It's a scam!!!!! I paid my balance in less than 2 months and canceled my account!,2
Payments and interest way too high!,"The loans were okay. The line of credit is absolute BS . I say the loans are okay because if you can pay them off early or pay the balance back quickly it's a great deal,  but that line of credit is crap no matter how you pay they take interest I paid 250 bucks early I got 32 dollars towards my line of credit . You can't pay it back early all payments made early just go towards your next payment do not use their line of credit they rape you financially",1
Line of credit and loans,Payments are too high and causes more financial hardship. It’s hard to pay this off because you are paying way too much in interest. Would not recommend this business.,2
Payments are too high and causes more…,You guys took the payment out on the wrong day. Cost me 30 dollars. I do not get paid every two weeks. I get paid two weeks from the 29th.

That money still has not hit my bank account and how can I make sure you guys are on my pay day schedule? I don't get paid the same days every month. I just want everyone on the same page.

When I logged in at the top it said it would be deposited today, but when I scrolled down to pending transactions it said 2-5 business days. I know it said it could depend on the bank. I'm not sure why it would say deposited the next day but when I logged in just to find out I have to wait two to five business days. I just needed the money to get by until payday but It seems I will get paid before it is even deposited. Just a little confused because in my email and at the top it said it will be deposited today and haven't received the deposit or any emails regarding the loan except to leave a review and that funds would be available today.

Wished I never started......my blog is already sharing common experiences.  Collecting data points for possible public shaming on your operation. Shame on you. Never will recommend and will go our of my way to insure people don't lean in on you.,2
All around awful,For a $2100 line of credit be prepared to pay over $7000 in interest before the loan is paid off. Trying to get my balance down and payoff early. I made a $1000 payment. Only $300 was applied to the principal and $700 was applied to interest. Never missed a payment. I still owe $1800. Do not get a loan from these sharks!!!!!,1
Filed Complaint with Consumer Protection Agency to investigate if the way CashNet calculates daily interest rates are legal for my state...stay tuned.,"Wheww! Where should I begin. The overall experience with this company was great, funds were readily available and the process was smooth. HOWEVER the interest rate is HORRIBLE never will I ever again.I opened  my account in May & paid it off in July I only financed 1000 & by the time I paid off the balance was at 1200 no way! Thread lightly with this company!",1
That interest rate!,Horrible I would never use again. I payed back way more than I borrowed. It’s a scam made to take advantage of people who are in desperate need for money. You are better off getting a credit card or using a local small loan place.,2

And when I got approved they never told me the APR % …,2
I’m very disappointed,"I was surprised about how much my payments were this time around! Was not THAT much with my first loan experience. On the plus, you are still easy and convenient!!",1
I was surprised about how much my payments are,"I would run far and quick from getting a loan thru CashNetUSA.  First, the interest will kill you.  Second, the payments are ridiculous.  The payments on a 2k loan were 325 dollars every two weeks for six months.  I would recommend trying every avenue possible before using them for money.  Don’t let this company take advantage of your situation.",2
Avoid this company at all cost…,I was under the impression this was an installment loan when I took it out. Ended up being a line of credit with ridiculous interest compiled daily.

Do not use unless no other means available and extremely dire situation,"Do not trust this company to give you a loan. I feel into desperation during the covid lock down and heard good things about them so I thought I would try it. My first mistake. I know owe far more money to them than I can even withdraw.

Fuked!,"Pro is that they will pre-approve or approve you. No doubt. Con is that the interest is extremely high and it accumulates daily. Every time you think you’re making progress on repaying your loan, you log in and see they have pretty much added so much interest that you’re back to the amount of the first week. My advice to you is go somewhere else where they are honest and doesn’t try to take advantage of you doing a difficult time in life. I definitely would not have applied for a loan from CashNet if I had read the reviews on other sites beforehand.",1

Then said they can't tell me how much each payment would be.... but why not? Its like a credit card... but I took the full amount it allowed and it said my first payment would be $95.. so shouldn't all my payments be $95 and not $330? Paying off asap.

I was applying for loans close to a year ago so I figured they must had my info and thats why they were able to pre approve me. Anyways I was truly so happy when the letter came because it was the perfect amount i was needing for my family at the time and I knew I was going to be able to pay it off quickly. I went online verified my info and entered my routing and account number. It was doing anything when i hit apply so I called just to find out I was not approved but was actually denied and she wasnt able to tell me why. She said it may be because of the bank I use but why would they send letters lying saying your approved for a certain amount when in reality you might not be. It was a lie and really got my hopes up and was so happy thinking i was going to be able to get what I needed for my family. seriously so depressing really sucks",1

Then she clearly gave me instructions about getting on line to complete the loan application.  That when I had some issues. First issue was for almost 25 minutes I didn't get a confirmation code that was to be send to me in my email to verify my email and other information. Then I checked of to allow electronic transfers and supplied them with the name of my bank, routing number and account number. What raised RED FLAGS was when I was asked for my banking user name and password.  At that point I got suspicious because I remember when I opened my bank account years ago to never ever give out my banking user name and password. That's like giving someone absolute and complete access to my bank account/money. Of course I did not give them that particular personal information.",1
The initial phone call was great,"Think twice before borrowing. I took out my loan in 2018 because I couldn’t afford rent. It did help me not get evicted, but I’ve been having to borrow because the min payments went up and up. It got to the point where from 01/01/2022 to 06/24/2022, I’ve been charged 3574 dollars in interest at 800/mo. You cannot get ahead with this loan. I was finally able to secure a debt consolidation loan, and my balance finally reads zero, but I have lost so much money, over $400 rent. I’ve been there, and I know why you’re considering borrowing. Just think twice because if you can’t pay it back and you can only make the minimum payments, you’ll never pay off this debt. I learned my lesson the hard way, not saying don’t do it. If I hadn’t, I’d be homeless but just think twice about it. Also, at least when I first borrowed, it started at $500, then it was raised again and again and again until I was at $2500; if you don’t have reasonable impulse control, this is not a loan for you.",2

Im like but I was told I could do another loan yesterday with no problem , I asked her can you extend the due date by 2 days please so I can take my loan today it is Friday and I need the instant funding because the weekend is coming and I cant get instant funding on the weekend , she again told me I would have to wait until Monday to reapply for my loan. I called back a couple of hours later to ask if I took my loan on Sunday 5/1, when would I receive funding , well THIS NEW WOMAN SAID I COULD HAVE TAKEN MY LOAN THIS MORNING  , FRIDAY AT THE SAME TIME I CALLED AND DID MY PHONE PAYMENT AND THEY COULD GO IN TO MY ACCOUNT AND ADJUST THE DUE DATE FOR ME MANUALLY , SO THE LADY FROM THIS MORNING  WAS WRONG AND BECAUSE OF HER  IT WAS NOW TO LATE IN THE DAY TO DO MY LOAN WITH INSTANT FUNDING AND THAT SHE WAS SORRY . I told her this whole experience was  so awful and that now I would have an additional $100 fee to one of my bills because I would not able to pay my bill due on 5/1 on time because I was not able to get my loan with instant funding so know my payment will be late because I cant get funding until 5/2 all because I was not given the proper information in the first place .

Never received my loan!!!,Been with this company for years never had a problem with them until they owed me money for taking out of my banking account in error. Got an email saying they would be sending me a check by mail in Jan it is now March and I've called them 7x in this regard. They keep telling me a manager will call or email over and over. When I ask to speak to a manager of course there isn't one available. I should make them pay interest on the money they owe me for 2 months. Customer Service reps have a very bad mannerism and needs retraining or moved to a different dept!,1
Fake don't mess with it,Do not use ! interest and monthly payments are way to high. Don’t get caught up with these people!,1
Lots of false advertising going on.,Won’t accept me. Wouldn’t suggest this site!,1
Timothy driver,This company is horrible! If you know like i know you'll by pass this app!!! They charge you interest daily and its out of this world high!!! They take payments out twice like a interest payment then the actual payment of the loan. Every time they take money out its a different percentage and it's higher. So if you are paying a note  for 120 they will take that plus 8 dollars a day so add 8xhow ever many days in the month and see exactly how they are ripping you off!! Thats why the loan so easy to get! The way this is set up you will never pay this loan off. My daughter borrowed 700.00 and been making payments but they dont reflect on the loan until you pay the interest down to 3 percent so now her loan is 1500. 00 this is a straight rip off. Stay away people stay away!!,2
They were very helpful,This company should be closed down till they are educated on how not to take advantage of people...300%interest is totally unheard of..then they take 2 payments out at a time..,2
Did I get the loan,"This company say they only deal with a small amount of bank accounts, i have an online only bank and they won’t help me because of that. Some people can only have that type of account and because of that y’all won’t help, I will definitely not recommend y’all to anyone ever",2

This is FAKE!!!,This company is a scam and they take advantage of people.  A loan should have one monthly reasonable payment not 3 monthly high payments.  For almost 3 years. DO NOT DO Business with these crooks,1
Good company,"If I could give less then one star I MOST DEFINITELY would!!! This company is the opitomy of a DISHONEST loan shark!!! I sent a cashiers check to pay off my account and first the man on the phone gave me the WRONG address to send the check. I had to call to get the payoff amount. My check was returned to the bank because of the address and my bank said that this it rather customary because it gives them more time to add interest to your account and at 299% yearly that is can be anywhere from a few dollars and up. Mine got up to $15+ a day while waiting for this HORRID company to fix my account...but they STILL want the interest and refuse to fix it. My bank sent the check out a second time to the correct address and CashNet USA cashed my check but then the next month reversed the check off my account but never returned the funds. Also in going over my account VERY CAREFULLY I found MANY discrepencies. There were a few months where they took payment but NEVER posted it to my account or reversed the payment and never returned the monies. On 1/14/21 my year to date interest was $134.70 with $260.42 charged for the month. Then on 2/11/2021 my year to date interest was $1,053.26 with $322.60 charged in interest for the month. I'm not a math teacher but that doesn't add up. I reached out to the company SEVERAL times to fix these issues but to no avail. Finally I gave up...and they stopped harassing me mid 2021. Well a couple months ago I found out that they sent my account to a collection agency for  an unpaid and delinquent account . I had to go back to my bank to get a copy of the cashed cashier's check dated 10/14/2020. I THINK this is finally settled...but the collection agency is not responding to my emails...so who knows. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY...but if circumstances in your life require you to use a cash advance loan shark CAREFULLY and DILIGENTLY go over EVERY statement and transaction!!!

This company is horrible,"I really don’t appreciate how high the apr is! Completely ridiculous. Instead of being reasonable give those with bad credit a chance at a lower rate. In my opinion most people only want to not pay it off and rip you off due to the fact that they have to pay $3,000 for only $1,000 in the long run if you don’t pay the loan off the next day you’ll be broke. People with bad credit or in my case brand new credit should be given the privilege of getting such a low apr. Most people with fantastic credit scores are only like that because they got money or it took them there whole life( at least that’s what I’ve seen). I’m not rich I’m 18 make little money unless I hit my 60 hour mark. But I’ve got two cars(27,986 and 29,999)three credit cards(Total available credit 750) and never missed a payment in my life, my utilization rate 10%. But I did bring my credit from 300 to 600 in less than 2 months. And yet I’m still stuck with. 23% apr on both my vehicles. Even know I do everything correct make payments on time. So think of yourself as a company do you want to be the ones that people hate and only thrive for the money than be my guest, a company should thrive for helping there economy, for there people, and for there pride. Sure the company I work for is extremely wealthy one of the wealthiest in the world.

This company sucks!!!!!,I have been trying for several times to get a loan through you. Always denied. I guess it is because of credit rating. Too bad you don't try to help those of us who really need it and put a little faith in us.,1

Have tried to get a loan and never did…,We applied for a loan to get a little help getting Christmas for our children and got denied... We even received a pre-approval offer in the mail so we go through the steps listed on the offer and once again get denied... It's one thing to be denied but it's totally different to get pre-approval emails and offers in the mail just to be denied yet again!!!!  Thanks for the help NOT!!!! POINT BEING DO NOT SEND APPROVAL LETTERS OUT TO STILL DENY FUNDING!!! This would have greatly helped in getting Christmas for 5 kids.... The initial denial didn't bother me.... It was after I got the pre- APPROVAL offer that I thought I would be able to get them a better Christmas.... In other words I was never APPROVED!!!!!,1
Y'all turn me down and I pay y'all out,The website itself tends to have any issues.,1
High interest,This so called lending company is a joke. If I had everything they wanted then why would I need them in the first place,1
Payback is 3 times initial loan,"This company is a rip off since they changed ownership or management I’ve used them since 1999 and they used to be excellent for letting me get a payday loan Now if the lend you $650.00 they want $1,1908.48 back which is ripping me off I promise you I will Never use this company ever again & I’m reporting them to the commissioner & BBB",1

I only took out a $1000 loan there is no reason I should be paying this company back over $3000. Payments are taken biweekly and as soon as your check deposits into your account. I’ve paid back the loan and then some! I will be closing my account/stopping payment to lock them out! It’s ridiculous. You basically NEVER PAY THE LOAN OFF. You will be trapped into a vicious cycle!

Great Service 👍👍💯,"The fees and the interest rates are outrageous. Definitely do not recommend it. I made a $150 payment and my balance did not drop at all, mind you I only had a $600 balance.

Don’t like them at all,Store close while I was in the middle of my application.,1

Bullsh!t,"I applied for a very small loan, I am a Grandma raising my Grandchildren.

I also receive an additional income for my Grandchildren from Job And Family services of $442.00 there really wasn't a spot for the information but tried to include as assurance I could repay the loan. I feel absolutely humiliated and embarrassed as I've never been the type to ask for anything. My babies have had a rough year we've each had Çovid at separate time's. My husband fought and was injured for this Country, yet it seems This Country has never fought for us. I was trying to do something for them at Xmas because right now we're all they have that care. I've had custody of them for 6 years and although it's a struggle at times ,I'm so Blessed to have them.

Extremely high interest rate,The interest is higher than expected. I borrowed $700 and will pay back well over $2000. That seems a bit excessive.,1
CashNet is a scam,"Cash net is not what I expected, I feel I have been taking advantage of and I will never do business with them ever again and I most definitely will not advise anyone else too.

After calling to move a payment and then asking the service rep three times if I wouldn’t have a payment they said no all three times. Now the day comes when I’m NOT supposed to be be charged and CashNetUSA is taking money out of my bank I had no idea about. Call them about this and this time they say that I couldn’t move this payment and they’re not sure why the last representative said that. But they’ll still take your money even if it’s a communication or negligence issue on their part. Also don’t just pay your minimum amount you’ll only being paying on your interest only. Only use CashNetUSA if it’s your absolute only option trust me I know it sucks but beg your family and friends first before using them.,1
Not Recommended,"If you okay with just paying interest and fees with the minimum payment, this is for you. Nothing goes to the principal when you make your payments. They don't try and work with you on any level. I thought when I found you guys it was a blessing now it has become my nightmare.",1

After sending them the paperwork they asked for FIVE DIFFERENT TIMES I just gave up. Would not recommend using them. Mobiloans is way better!,1
Advertising is misleading,System outdated and not worth the interest.  Search around before you get jacked by these rip offs,1
The interest is higher than expected,Since I was a repeat customer they just took my general information and skipped me to the end I was unable to review my bank information and there is no way to correct it so because I could not see my bank account information or what not they had wrong bank account and funded the money to that I was told it was my fault even though there is no way to correct it other than to email them which I tried several times before they funded the money to the wrong bank account and then again I was told that was my fault so now I got a wait extra daysSend it back so it can be sent to the right account because They just realized that I had updated that information,2

Predatory,I was a customer for many many years I had large amount of loans that I paid off every dime over the years never had a payment return never was delinquent I referred many people and now I try to do a small payday advance loan and they declined me I think that's terrible customer service as a whole.. the agents there are very nice and they even felt bad so I think cash net USA needs to really honor their loyal customers like myself I'm really disappointed,1
Horrible Experience,Do not take a loan from this company. They should not even be legal. It's absolutely ridiculous how much they charge you. You will never recover without bankruptcy if you accept a loan from this company.,1
Yall are some loan sharks,This is a company that takes advantage of people in need of money.  There was no explanation on the outragious finance charges and how they schedule the payments.  I don't think they even checked my credit but just approved me for $1200.  If you don't make biweekly payments then interest rate is over 300%.  I don't know how I will pay all this back..  I just discovered that it will take 18 months to pay back $1200 at a rate of $250 to $365 a month to pay back..,1

I own 2 business small businesses and I don’t have paychecks stubs I sent in Every piece of information they needed and here we are 3days later and I still don’t have an approval or denial.

Not quite the case. Still waiting for an email that was to be sent momentarily. We endured some hurricane damage and needed something fast and were let down by their ads. May want to have back up plan if you have a real need or emergency.I have contacted the number and they could not help. The email showed up days later. Stating basically I had no credit which was the purpose of making a small loan. Anyway the reply is nice but the facts are calling got no answers and was told come back in 30 days? I'll pass. I'm a customer and without us you dont have a business. Most places forget that as they grow. That is unfortunate. Thank you for the computer generated report but not exactly customer service.,1

When I submit my application at 11am on the second day and the offices don't close until 8pm, one would expect it could be approved in that timeframe. Instead, I received yet another email that my application had been withdrawn.Edit: I have now finally received the approval that my loan will be processed.Edit again: it is now Monday.

Not happy with interest rate!!!,"Was thankful to receive a loan when no one else would extend credit. However, that comes at a price. With a 299% interest rate, it is nearly impossible to pay down quickly; the interest alone made up the majority of my bi-weekly payment. The website is nearly useless, you can't skip a payment or request a payoff there. They say that they were helping people during the pandemic, but I didn't see it. If you skipped a payment, the interest still accrued, and in two weeks, you now have two payments due. If you want to postpone the second one, you have to use their inefficient phone system. Glad that the regulations in Virginia prevents them from doing further business there.",2

I went to the deposit section of my bank and sent several screenshots of all the deposits.  Then i get an email stating it was withdrawn and to fill out the application again. So i do. I sent them a benefit letter for each Social Security direct deposit, and like 8 different screenshots showing those deposits and the direct deposits of each of the pensions. I kept checking today, the 13th. They send me an email once again saying it was withdrawn and to fill out the application again and send a copy of my most recent paystub. Hello? I dont get a paystub.

I owe $300 as of today but the funds that were supposed to come into my account was sent out to the wrong account. I am a hotel front desk agent, and what Cash Net USA did was equivalent of me checking a guest into an occupied room. One mistake that is supposed to never be tolerated was made by Cash Net USA. I will no longer do business with Cash Net USA. I do business with a few other payday advance agencies, and none of them have ever sent me money, and ended up funding the wrong account.

I tried using your online application process to get my money deposited in the 10 minutes it has been multiple hours. had not been an emergency I would have never tried to get an online loan but now it is normal business hours and I can go to my regular Bank get it but I've already got this in limbo. Instead of taking another hit to my credit score I will be waiting this out.,1

For some reason for the last two payments, they have not given me credit for the rate reducer.  Meaning 5/6 next payment 6/6 and then 10% reduced off interest.  The rate reducer has not changed for two months staying at 5/6. I have tried my best to resolve the issue by chat and the company seems not to care.I pay 680 a month for a 2500 loan and have never been late.  Yes, I realize the crazy interest, but I am in a trap and doing my best to pay it off on top of the interest.",1
Detrimental mistake made with no follow up,"I can not believe the amount of positive reviews for cash net. First of all, before I go on my rant I will say I haven’t found myself in a payment bind nor have I had any experience working with their customer service team. My review is strictly off of the 275.85% yearly APR, and In addition multiple other daily fees. If you are in a life and death situation I’d say go for it (bc how worst can it get), but you are literally paying whole car note payments . Most of your bi weekly payment is interest. I was initially paying 4-500 dollars monthly on $1,600 loan with barely no movement in the loan going down. Now I owe $1100(paid extra on one of the payments ) which is $330/monthly payment. So I’ll be doing what I didn’t want to do and pull out of my 401K to pay this off this loan this week because this loan will never get paid off. you would literally have to pay twice the monthly amount to see any difference.Please listen and stay away. This is an expensive trap that you will kick yourself in the leg for later. I’m thankful my credit situation has turned itself around. 🙏🏾",1
Pnone person was great,this website is making me feel like they are trying to scam me and take my money because i was pre approved for 1000 then when finishing my application and after sending my bank info now i cant get what they already said i was approved for. now im uset highly and may have to close my account.,2
They lie to u about ur loan,This place is a waste of time .i asked for 200.00 and get weekly deposits to my account and was instantly denied after all the time I spent on there questions.if I had good credit I wouldn't be looking for a pay day loan so what's this place even here for?No help what so ever....dont waste your time it will just make u mad...,1
A year ago I applied for a loan,This is the most horrible company EVER. DO NOT do business with them. The charge outrageous interest and fees and they care NOTHING about their customers. I borrowed $1000 in December. I have made payments of over $255 every month. Last month my payment was over $300. Now my balance is $830. No money has been applied to my loan to take it down. Avoid them like the plague. They are awful!!!,1
don't work with online banks!,I give it a 2 cause it was not in my account the next day like they said it would be and I really needed the loan. Make sure you ask when you'll receive your money when you make a loan with this company CASHNETUSA,1
Everything was great and right on time…,Bogus Sends out false information,2
*BEWARE*,I was offered a discount code in my email.  Upon application of the loan the cash net system did not allow me use the discount code.  In a chat with a representative I was informed it could be because I reached the limit of times allowed to use the code.  I was told  after the loan is funded then I am to contact them again to find out if it’s applicable.  My point is why offer it in the first place if it cannot be used.,1
I apply for a loan and I got denied…,I write you're a true story because you won't give nobody a chance to get anything straightened out and help him with a long before they can get back on their feet I've had a very bad experience in the last year and a half to two years trying to get my stuff caught back up where I have got a major divorce and these people just don't want to work with nobody to help them out I'm on social security disability I am a older person that needs the help and these people won't help nobody all they care about is getting their last dollar so to me who this concerned I offered to try to straighten my account out with you just don't want to offer to try to help so I will rate you and a two-star business which is not really good at all so have a nice day and I hope you don't do no more elderly people like this they're not trying to help them out so thank you and have a nice day,2

Needless to say I won’t be using CASHNET AGSIN!",1
I called twice and the wait time was…,Incompetent!! I was approved for a payday loan and they sent it to the wrong bank account!! The account number was completely wrong! I call costumer service and they tell me to wait for the funds to be refused by the other bank and then call again tmrrw to check and then apply again on Thrusday when I get paid Friday! Completely defeats the purpose of a payday loan. I do not recommend this Incompetent company!!,1
Not 10 minutes!,"Whatever you do, avoid Cashnetusa. Their fees and interest rates are unreasonable. On a $1000 cash advance, they charged me over $750 in fees and interest in a three month period. I made three $250 payments and my balance never went down in three months. The next month, they increased my balance. No matter what you do, even making extra payments, they continue to tack on outrageous fees. Even during this pandemic when people are struggling financially, they do not care. Cashnetusa is an example of what is wrong with America - Corporate GREED. For a $1000 loan that I took out in December, they have charged me over $700 in fees and interest. I have made three payments of over $250 since December 2020 and not one cent went towards my balance. I still owe $1008. This virus and pandemic has crushed many people’s lives. I am no different. Yet corporations like Cashnetusa don’t care. As long as it is money in their pockets, people like me don’t matter. I have reached out to customer service for answers, a solution and just help and understanding. I have received NOTHING. I was even told by customer service that my next payment will not be $250 but $300. This is a company that takes advantage of people who can least afford it. $700 in fees is obscene and heartbreaking. I cry every time I think about it. I will discourage anyone I can to NOT use this company. They don’t care about the American people. It’s just about the money they can put in their pockets. I reached out to Customer Service with no results. The problem is that you have charged me over $700 worth of fees in three month on a $1000 loan. I have made 3 payments of $250 for three months and there was NO CHANGE in my balance. Customer Service also told me my payment will go up this month. How is this helping people during this difficult time? I isn't I want to see a reduction in my balance so I can pay this loan off. This is so difficult for me and extremely upsetting. During this time when we are all suffering because of this pandemic, CashnetUSA has not compassion or understanding. People like me who are suffering financially yet you keep piling on the interest every day putting me deeper and deeper in a hole. You don’t care about suffering. I will Not EVER borrow money from this awful company! Yet is ridiculous the way you pile on the interest making it impossible for someone like me to catch up and pay down the debt. I took a cash advance for $1000 in December. Since then I have made three payments of over $250 and my balance is still $108. No money has gone to paying down the $1000. This is ridiculous. I will NEVER do business with CashnetUSA again as soon as I pay this money off. I am literally in tears about this. During this time people’s finances are strained, you don’t care. It is all about GREED. I wish I had never done business with you at all. I have been with Cashnet since 2009, yet you make no allowances. I will discourage anyone, as many people as I can, from using CashnetUSA. Shame on you! As I said, I am literally in tears about this. It is upsetting and depressing.",1

This is a company that takes advantage of people who can least afford it. $700 in fees is obscene and heartbreaking. I cry every time I think about it. I will discourage anyone I can to NOT use this company. They don’t care about the American people. It’s just about the money they can put in their pockets. I reached out to Customer Service with no results. The problem is that you have charged me over $700 worth of fees in three month on a $1000 loan. I have made 3 payments of $250 for three months and there was NO CHANGE in my balance. Customer Service also told me my payment will go up this month. How is this helping people during this difficult time? I isn't I want to see a reduction in my balance so I can pay this loan off. This is so difficult for me and extremely upsetting. During this time when we are all suffering because of this pandemic, CashnetUSA has not compassion or understanding. People like me who are suffering financially yet you keep piling on the interest every day putting me deeper and deeper in a hole. You don’t care about suffering. I will Not EVER borrow money from this awful company! Yet is ridiculous the way you pile on the interest making it impossible for someone like me to catch up and pay down the debt. I took a cash advance for $1000 in December. Since then I have made three payments of over $250 and my balance is still $108. No money has gone to paying down the $1000. This is ridiculous. I will NEVER do business with CashnetUSA again as soon as I pay this money off. I am literally in tears about this. During this time people’s finances are strained, you don’t care. It is all about GREED. I wish I had never done business with you at all. I have been with Cashnet since 2009, yet you make no allowances. I will discourage anyone, as many people as I can, from using CashnetUSA. Shame on you! As I said, I am literally in tears about this. It is upsetting and depressing.",2
This company is full of crap I wouldn’t…,"Cashnetusa is an example of what is wrong with America - Corporate GREED.  For a $1000 loan that I took out in December, they have charged me over $700 in fees and interest. I have made three payments of over $250 since December 2020 and not one cent went towards my balance. I still owe $1008.  This virus and pandemic has crushed many people’s lives. I am no different.

They do not accept Chime bank accounts…,"As single person struggling as is, this was my worst decision ever. My car broke down, and started a new job because of COVID 19. So I didn’t have enough money to cover my bills and pay to fix my car. So I want with company from how great the reviews were. I got my cash really fast, which was great. However the interest is crazy! And they charge you interest  everyday. They don’t care if you have never missed a payment. I had only received the loan for $500. I have paid them so far $915.98, and they still say I have $368.45 out standing balance. And I got this loan originally in 8/14/2020, and I have not borrow from them since. So please don’t use this company, it’s not worth it. If you are strapped for cash. Try another company I will not use this company ever again or recommend it to anyone",2
No help at all,If there was a one star option I would do it.    If your reading this don’t do this to yourself!!!    I had to pay off my account in full.   To avoid the 300% interest.   They are crooks!   After my payoff they still charged me an extra months payment for no reason!   Said there was nothing they could do about it.,2
Cashnet plays games,You guys mess around with the due dates I get my social security check on the 3rd of the month you guys keep bouncing my account because you insist on taking it out the first or the second so I moved it again this is a third month in a row I've had to call you guys cuz you bounce my checking account what's so hard about hearing that I only get paid on the 3rd not to take money out before that I don't get it,1
Sufficient,I think the interest rate is way to high and the loan I had with them I paid twice.  Finally I couldn't afford with COVID-19 until they offered me a settlement.  Never again,2
Funding takes too long before you get…,"VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED!!   If you are looking for a loan to help yourself and can't pay it back quicker than you wish.   DON'T USE CASHNETUSA!   I didn't mind that they draft every payday.  Where it hurts, is that the courtesy fees are ridiculous and makes the payment amount goes up because of those fees, not that you are constantly borrowing from the amount that you are approved for. :-(((((((",2
Waiting to see if I get approved or not,Charged me multiple times even after overdrawing my account and said I never paid but it took the money out. I'll never use them again.,1
rates are too high+,I am a returning customer and was happy to hear I was approved for a line of credit because I need emergency vehicle repairs. I made a draw request and received nothing yet online they say I owe. I chatted with their employee Gary. He verified my bank account and stated it would be there yesterday. Waited all day and nothing. This is very frustrating.,1
In the past have had great transactions…,Receive several loans from this company last year and this year applied for two and were denied without explanation. They said that they sent me an email explaining why and I never received it. I checked my spam folder and it wasn’t there either. They insisted they sent it. I’m asking for an exclamation I am not getting one and I find it very frustrating. Are used to like this company and today I find them very inefficient and unhelpful.,1
I'm saying all I got to say to you…,If you are broke don’t take out a 325% loan. It’s the worst idea you can have. Just ask whoever you owe money to let you owe them in weekly payments as opposed to this company. And that’s on period.,1
Funds got sent to another account,"To charge the rates you charge. When ppl are struggling and locked up with covid or the blizzards.  If someone is coming to you for help. They are already struggling.  Then to rape them with charges and make it even harder for them. Just wrong! Will get you paid,  close you completely and never use you again or recomend",1

I tried at least 5 times to get a loan…,Please do yourself a major disappointment and STAY AWAY from this company.  They will not disclose the actual terms of the loan prior to closing.  Once close they will charge you approx. $8 a day per 1000 loaned.  So pay $300 monthly (actual pmt higher) meaning $240 interest pmt.  If paying minimum payments would take in excess of `1 yr to payoff. STAY AWAY - DON'T USE - TELL EVERYONE - BIG BIG RIPOFF,1
"Maybe they are right, they are not a financial company!  Should be illegal",Interest is to high!! My balance has not gone down at all!! they don’t take inconsideration that you have other obligations to pay but they take 2 payments out at the same time if you need emergency money consider another option not CashNetUSA,1
I badly need a loan,"Service fees are far to much. Borrowed $2,000.00 made my first payment of $290.00 still owed over $2,100.00 next payment two week later n the amount of $272 . I know I signed up for this but damn to much for to little. Will pay this off ASAP and never use it again!",1
Outrageous daily fees,I have to pay more than what I owe and still continuously trying to take money out of my account leaving me negative of rejection to their payment. Even if I requested a new payment date they still trying to take money out . They robbing us badly . Please don’t apply to CashNetUSA. My info is stuck with them until they got all the money they want from me . I wouldn’t recommend this at all.,1
All is well,"If you can help it, 🤬 NEVER!! 🤬take out any type of payday loan. The payments only increase every month making it almost impossible to pay off. Just get another job or rob a 711 first (jail time is better than the interest rate on theses types of loans!)... I’m so glad I am finally rid of this high interest rates debt!!! Oh praise sweet baby Jesus, I’m free!!!! 🥳🥳🥳🥳",2
I hate Facebook,"Biggest crooks in the business. Highest interest rates I have ever incurred. No interest in helping when issues arise. Literally the biggest mistake of my life. I owe 1900 on a 1500 loan and paid them $700 last month. Makes perfect sense, eh?",1
Total rip off!,Be very careful payment plan is very deceptive.  Payments are ridiculously high,1
I appreciate them for being there in my…,I made a mistake by applying for a loan with this company. I then find out they don’t offer loans in my state. It’s been a few months now and I received an email from their collection department saying I owed more than $600. This email said they had my email and SSN. It said they tracked my IP address. Of course they have my info I applied but I replied to the sender letting them know which state I lived in and wanted all info pertaining to the loan sent to me I didn’t hear anything else. Don’t give them your information,2
If you are late in payment an you do…,"They are good for very short term, if you are late you will be in the hook and will pay 3 times what you owe.",1
Super predatory loans,The fees are triple of a normal check loan on lines of credit.  They do have customer service after you get a $500 interest fee if you have questions. I believe I've paid $1600 in fees and interest in 80 days on a $1500 LOC. They put you in collections the same day your fees are due by 5 pm that day if you haven't made the payment. They prefer ach so they can force your bank. I thought it would be like a higher interest credit card but Cash Net managed to far out pace a bad credit card in fees. Luckily I can pay for this mess but alot of people wouldn't. Their only possible business plan would have to be to get as much in interest as possible before you quit playing it or go bankrupt.,1
It was great to acquire this loan so…,Don’t ever get a loan from this place they charge you up the wall for daily interest you will end up paying TRIPLE For a loan with these guys You are better off saving your money or asking a family member or friend to borrow the money. RUN as far as u can from these loans,2
I would recommend you stay away,I log into my account and reset My password why I can't get in to borrow money,1
They Are Thieves Stealing From The Elderly,"It's ok if you just got to get a loan, but pay them back as quickly as possible because they CHARGE YOU A ARM AND A LEG TO USE THEIR MONEY!!!!AND I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY TO NOBODY THEY ARE LOAN 🦈 SHARK!!!!!!!",1

Check ur balance if u can't use ur line…,"I’ve been a customer with this lender well over seven years. Initially they were awesome, however now they are horrible. It states that you can get same-day funding after paying off your loan if you reapply by 10:30 AM Eastern time. Unfortunately they are not submitting the information to Veritec in the state of Michigan in a timely manner. Therefore you are not able to reapply until after 3:30 PM and funds are not sent to your account until the following business day which would be Monday.This is definitely misleading and false advertisement.  State the truth to the customers informing them that if they live in a state where Veritec has to approve the loan let them know it’s not gonna happen until after 3pm so stop saying same-day funding.!!!!!!",1
Your interest are to high.,Don’t waste your time. If you can’t pay this loan off on one lump sum then all your monthly payments go straight to interest. I’ve made multiple payments and zero have went to principle. It’s robbery,1

I have told them I cannot make a payment and could they move my payment dates because of my salary structure is different. These fools are still trying to get me to pay on a particular date that I don’t receive my pay on. I told them about this a week ago and they are still trying to get money out of me.Update after Cashnetusa’s reply:If there were other options, customer service nor collections never reached out to me about them, but continued to send me emails about missing a payment.",1
Interest too high,I usually get snabby people but simone is very nice,2
This place is a waste of time .i asked…,I have tried to apply for this loan several times and it keeps telling me I'm not approved because I have no credit line which is really weird because I have had loans and paid them all back on time and I have never had any issues getting a loan anywhere except for this one cashnet. But from the bad reviews I see on how much they charge I think it's best to stick with my normal ones. Not even gonna waist my time anymore.,1

My Balance has been at $1800+ For the last few statements even though I’ve paid almost $700 in payments in the last 2 weeks. You would think that when I make a payment my balance would go down, but it doesn’t. I’m basically just giving them my hard earned money instead of it going towards my balance. At this rate I’ll be paying for the next 5 years!! DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR ANYONE!!! So glad they are not offered in Va anymore. It’s probably because everyone got tired of being robbed of their money!! Yes I know I borrowed from them and I am paying them back but it would be more of a relief if my balance would go down instead of up when I make a payment!!! So disgusted!",1
If I could give zero I would!,Giving the lowest rating because I filled out an application online and I made a mistake and didn't put the bank account number correct and Cashnet sent the money to the wrong account number. I fault Cashnet partially because it was a 10 digit account number and accounts have 12 digits so how am I supposed to pay it back and never received the money? I have called about every few days explaining the mistake I made and never received the money but it is still charged to me. It was a 10 digit account number which isn't even valid for any bank. Calls to customer service and the bank isn't a help because I am still held for the money I never received. How is it my bill? I never received the money,1
I’m upset with Cashnet,"These people are crooks. If you're looking cash in a bind with no high interest rates I urge you to try LendUp or Speedy Cash. They offer loans and depending on your payback history, multiple ones at the same time. Cashnetusa used to be reliable & descent when they offered the $300 payday loan. As soon as they switched to installment loan option I was done. You will end up paying 10x or more what they loan you. I urge you to PLEASE go else where and stay far away from these crooks.",1
Incompetent!,"cashnet should not be allowed to operate in this lifetime, they gouge to the public at 189% per loan",1
Whatever you do,"I made the unfortunate decision to borrow money from these leeches in 2019. The interest rates are ridiculously high and I paid them back in full in September of 2019. I just received a letter in the mail January 2021 about how they've sent me to collections on a $350 debt that I don't owe. I took pictures and documented everything and I paid them off IN FULL. They said they only credited $1000 even though my bank account shows that it was charged more than that for the full month. Every time I try to call the people are completely useless. Their customer service is just as atrocious as their 300% interest rates. If they were going to send me to collections for a debt I already paid, why wait a year and a half? Were they hoping I would forget about it so they could get more money from me? This is the worst place I have ever done business with and I'm not paying a penny more to them.Edit: I've called twice and the customer service reps refused to help me and all they did was tell me to call collections. They said they could only drop it if I get a letter from cashnetusa  saying that my debt was paid in full which you refuse to do. My debt was $1,133.44 and I paid you $1,134. They only credited my account with paying $1,000, so did you pocket the extra $134? I even called cashnetusa THAT DAY and they said I paid it off. When I called collections they said you sold my ""debt"" to collections 9 days after I paid it off, but I just got a letter about it THIS MONTH, almost a year and a half later saying I owe $350. So, no. I won't be calling your joke of customer service. What I will do is go to the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Consumer Affairs. Cashnetusa is nothing but a bunch of criminals.",1

At a time where the country is in turmoil to charge almost 600 a month on a 2k where the interest doesn't allow the balance to move down at all is hurting the people who are already suffering. Lower the interest rate to help the people.,1
Horrible Company,"It’s great that you get your money super fast. However in reality it is not worth it. I borrowed $500.00 for unpredictable car expensive. And I have to have car to get to and from work. So I got the money I need from them real quick. But what they get you on daily fee. Each day you don’t pay the loan off they charge you a fee. Even if you have not missed any payment or been late. So reality I am paying them 1,202.48 for a $500.00 loan . So it’s just worth bouncing a couple bills and paying the late fee then getting a loan from them!!!",1
I paid $500 a month for almost a year,Will not allow extra payments to pay them off to avoid some of that high interest.,1

This thing is a whole mess they said back in 2007 I applied for a loan with them and I used  a JP Morgan Chase bank account at that time. Well that is not the bank that I used when I applied yesterday. I don’t have that bank account anymore and haven’t since 2007. So they took it upon themselves to try send my loan to a closed bank account. I was advised this morning to wait until January 8th for Chase Bank to reject the loan. This place is the only source where they have a decent review rating. Everywhere else people have nightmares dealing with them...makes me wonder. So now I need to wait until the 8th and  pray that I don’t become one of the nightmare stories of them hounding me for money that I never received.

I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!!,1
During this time when we are all…,Horrible customer service once you have paid down your balance and are not asking for more money. I have been told for at least 3 months that my account is in review which means they lock your account and do not allow you to see statements. I have never missed a payment.  I have called and emailed and my issue remains unresolved.,1
DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!,"Every time That I inquire about the best time to make an additional payment that will go towards my principle balance, I am never given a straight answer.  I just paid over $1100.00 towards my balance in a 10 day time period and only $600 went towards my principle.  That is ridiculous!!!!  I made the extra payments to bring down my principle balance but the way they have these loans set up is to take as much principle up front as possible.  Which prevents anyone from paying them down quickly.  They are never able to tell me when is the best time to make an additional payment that benefits me.  Total SHAM!  How anyone can give this company a rating above one star seems suspect to me.  I do not believe that these are legitimate ratings.",1

The money is direct deposited in your account within 24 to 48 hours and you make payments based on your pay cycle. It is unfortunate that it is not clearly explained how expensive it is to get a loan or line of credit from them. The interest is accrued daily on the outstanding balance of the loan. The annual APR is 299%. Yes!!  My advice is to read the fine print, ask questions, tough it out, go to your local bank. This was by far one of the worse mistakes I have ever made getting a line of credit while going through medical crisis, recovering from family related COVID-19, and struggling with financial hardship to pay for medical bills .",2

They lie on their response they flat out corporate criminals not here to help you at all! They know what they are doing is wrong and should be locked in prison for all the people they have ripped off over there existence!,1
Used my information,"Cashnet is one of the biggest crooked money lenders that charges a ridiculous intrest fee so that you will never pay back your loan and be done with them especially at this point in time when people are jobless and struggling to make end meet. This is a crooked loan site, stay away and do not get caught up in there debt scheme",1

I took $1,550 last year and today 11/30/2020 I called them and asked how much I already paid, they said, 3,048.00 and still owe them around $700 according to customer service, This company is not helping people but drowning them more in debts. Honestly is putting me in a worse situation then I already was in. Paying them 2x a month and getting an interest of 100% is not enough. It's killing me. Just a lesson learned. After paying them $3000 for a year I still owe $700??? This company is a thief!!!! I hope the management will rot in hell.",1
The fees are triple of that of a check loan,I will never borrow money from them again because I did not know you couldn't pay it off with a credit card that is 0% APR,1

It was paid back on next check, but no one mentioned they did not take $20 NSF fee. I found this and paid it on our own. Next time I applied, their employee told me for 15 minutes I was denied due to an outstanding loan, and that I was delinquent. A supervisor eventually figured out the $20 NSF showed as a PDL out in ND. Now I get denied every time I apply, stating my credit isn't good enough. Highly suspicious, and unfortunate they lose a 5 year customer after around 20 loans because an undisclosed $20 fee.",1
It's ok if you just got to get a loan,The payments are to high and too often every paycheck. Glad to have paid mine off. Don't advise this type of loan. Find a once a month type loan.,1

Don’t waste your time,Fees more than the loan and high payments...unless your desperate it’s not a good idea. Friendly staff though...800 loan 1100 in fees lol nope!,1
Did not follow through with their offer!,Terrible I write my email and after submit it comes back with 11337 Vilage brook Dr. There is no way it will reset my password. Emergency please!!!!!!,1
Save yourself the turmoil... avoid!,If I could give this company no star at all I would. I borrowed my max which was $500. I paid 3 payments already and now my balance is over $600.00 . I understand interest.. but this is ridiculous.,1
Nothing but confusion between me and…,"CNUsa great for in a pinch. My first loan was great i knew all expectations. However by my 3 advance, i started noticing the payment would flux. One day my balance would go down but two days later it would be higher by $3-$4 not something so big to notice. But i noticed. I always paid $20-$50 more than the payment due. This should bring the balance down and possibly my payments..wrong my balance would go up like i said $3-$4 and my payment fluxed between same $10. I hate when large companies think its okay to take from a needing hard honest bill paying person. Who has NEVER missed a payment OR EVEN ASKED FOR AN EXTESION DURING THE COVID PANDEMIC. Wow...really CNUSA jst replied a vague response. Im nit complaining about the contract. Im upset that upon my 2nd and 3rd issue of money your company stole from me. When i call to get an explanation your reps hang up on me. Im done i paid my bill in full and i will be sure to warn others of your approach.",2
I contacted Cashnetusa because I needed…,I got a letter in the mail saying I was approved for 800 dollars with an offer code. It said I could go to the website and then I seen it was another form for verification so I called and was told I was denied for I filled out the form again and wasn't accepted. I was softly denied that's right there made me upset.,1
I usually get snabby people but simone…,Great  service and friendly customer service,1
I have tried to apply for this loan…,Its worst service compare to GlobalCheckintoCash Loans USA,1
I regret getting this loan,299% apr. Daily rate nearly 10 percent. Please be careful out there. Ask your friend and  family beg them if you must. Pay them as of you would those lenders and pay them on time. Do not ever miss a payment to put your family in a bad spot. 0 interest (potentially) Pay your family first. Before you pay lenders like CashNetUSA who will take advantage of you financial situations. They will ask you why you need it and then spit on your face with an offer you absolutely can't refuse.  Please watch out.,2
Overall a major loanshark,They have some great customers willing to assist but not being able to get funding because of a 3 year old application decision of not being able to verify credit is dumb as hell. This policy is stupid! I applied 3 years ago and was denied for not being able to verify my credit and attempted to apply again today after 3 years and wasn’t able to submit a application! Shame on cash net USA and I don’t recommend this company it’s bogus! Send me all types of offers in the mail but when I attempt to apply I get turned down from doing a freaking application! I don’t recommend this source for emergency funding ahead of a hurricane or anything else to any family,1

Worst place ever  borrowed 500 and in the first 4 months already paid 58r back and still got 8,To be honest this is not like a credit card this is like getting a loan from the mob and you are charge three points a day so a person that is only getting a check once a month is paying out of their butts so I don't like this cash net and once I pay it off I'll never return again.,1
Bunch of thieves,Horrible service and they were very racist and degrading,1
This place is basically stealing your…,The application was easy and approved quickly. Thank you .,1
Giving the lowest rating because I…,Cashnet reduced my available credit shortly after covid 19 shut down a lot of places. Even though my income was not affected at all. Nothing changed for me. They just reduced my amount available for no reason. When people needed help the most Cashnet failed to help. This is the worst kind of company. Instead of being there for their customers they made getting money harder. Don't do business with this company if you care about companies that are actually there for their customers.,1
They are crooks,"If you are desperate enough to use cashnetusa you should probably rob a bank. You won't get screwed in prison as hard as cashnetusa will screw you. I had used a different service and expected the fees would be similar, but cashnetusa charges much higher fees and they start the interest on day 1. No chance to avoid the interest by paying in full within a month, they are hammering you from the very start. But the absolute worst thing they do is they hold your payment so they can continue charging their exorbitant interest. Made a payment 2 days ago, they acknowledge the payment was made, but my balance does not reflect it and the 8 bucks a day in interest keeps getting charged.",1
cashnet is a loanshark,This company has been drafting payments from my account for over a year..on the wrong day. When I changed jobs my payday changed but they would not change it to match. This has caused countless amounts of overdraft fees for me. I have reached out to them several times to help. But they won't.  This has to be unlawful.  I think I'm going to seek some legal help.,1
I would rate 0 stars if I could,I got a loan last year when my car broke down . They increased my limit and I always make on time payments. If you have the money to pay them off instantly then sure . But making monthly payments is a no. My BI WEEKLY PAYMENTS were 250. A piece so 500 overall. My loan was for 1700. No matter how much I paid or did I could NOT pay it off. I also asked for a settlement offer just anything to get this debt off me and account closed. Customer service informed me that they don’t do settlement offers which I’m sure is a lie. Anyways I did some debt consolidation and just paid the whole thing off and I hope to never deal with these ppl again . Definitely would not recommend as a lender . The high interest rate makes it impossible for you to pay them off. Yesterday my payoff was 1823 and today my payoff was 1872 . Please unless you’re seriously desperate do not go this route ! There are definitely better lenders with lower interest . Good luck,1
Really suck I tried opting out before…,"These people prey on the needy, and then hit you with their excessive and abusive fees / service charges so that you end up paying back more than 10 times what you originally borrowed.",1
I appreciate the service I received in…,Easy to get approved but the interest rates are ridiculous! 276% interest rate on a 1200 loan! There is a reason they approve everyone so they can make their money on these crazy interest rates! I nearly paid $2500 in just interest before even paying back my loan!,2
Good,"Absolutely ridiculous. I was approved for $800 yesterday and was told I would get the funds by end of business day. I realized I may have made a mistake on my account number so I chat with someone and I give them the proper account number who then confirms it as correct. Awhile later I hadn't gotten my funds yet so i called and gave my account number to confirm, they also said it was correct. I called back one more time not understanding why NY funds are not in the account just to find out, it wasn't the right account number. I tried giving her the right number and was told I couldn't, and it could take up to 5 business days to correct then error. Is this some kind of scam to get my social security number, bank info. Etc??? U can either deposit it on the right account as I asked or I can take it up on social media, the new, or better yet my father works for a radio station out here called The Fox. They do the Chiefs games which hundreds of thousands of people watch and listen to just for that one on day. I am not threatening, but I need that money asap",2

So I will not be recommending Cashnetusa to my family nor my friends or anyone else for that fact. I will take my business somewhere else then. Screw them,1
Sending my loan to the WRONG bank!!!,I use to love cashnetusa but I went to go to apply for a loan and they say that they don't use online banks. I  have always had the same banking information but now all of a sudden its always been this way that apparently. Really wish I could get my information off this website but no they get to keep my info.,1

I went to a loan company online the name is RISE , got a loan on the spot interest rate was 28%....  I was stupid to work with them as the charge not 299% interest but over a 1000%.as you see their response ...they have no answer...and they did not address any of my complaints ...I am working on revoking their license in my state as many other states already did.",1

Avoid,"This is the 2nd review I am given this Company.I have been using this Company for more than 2 years i had been getting the 1800.00 payday loan.Then Covid 19 came and they discontinued it and only had 500.00 loans which don't help me very much if I need to fix something in my house or car.Anyways I really just thought the World of Cashnet USA until....two days ago i looked at the loans and they had put the 1800.00 payday loan back.Well i called and i applied online too to sign documents.My Plumbing in the back yard is leaking really bad and I need it fixed last 2 weeks i had borrowed 500.00 from them to pay for the plumber to fix the front faucet it was also leaking bad and had to get a new fawcet put on cost 385.00 almost all of the money I borrowed from them. I Called them on payday and gave them my credit card..to pay off my 500.00 loan Then when I went online and saw I could now borrow my old 1800.00 I was going to go ahead and fix the back yard fawcett and fix my indoor bathtub fawcett. I am having problems with it too.I apllied and spoke with this girl and she said she would put it through.Then I got a call from cashnet usa about 10 minutes later and I answered it and they hung up..this was in the morning then about 530pm I get another call from a different girl telling me that now I have to send her my bank statements.Hmmmm thats odd after two years of loans from them and a loan I just did 2 weeks ago and paid back now I have to send them my personal bank account statements ..( and these people are working from home) No way I am not sending my bank statements to anyone.This just does not sound right all of a sudden now they need my bank statements.So I told Her I don't want to do the loan because I am not going to send ANYONE my bank statements they want to loan me the money and get the 300.00 or 400.00 back from loaning it to me that's fine ..But its not fine that all of a sudden they need my bank statements.So the next day I called to speak with a supervisor and of course not available and then this rep told me that I now need my front and back of my ID and I also Need my Bank statements too. I told her I want to know why now you need them after more than 2 years.(She couldn't give me an answer)I won't be using Cashnet USA anymore they won't be making several thousand dollars off me ANYMORE ( I have opted out my info to them on their end) and I have other Companies who will loan me money with my bank account info my social security number and my signature.I USED TO WORK FOR CITI BANK FOR 10 YEARS AND I AM NOT APLLYING FOR A HOME LOAN ( THEY DO NOT NEED YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION UNLESS THEY ARE PLANNING ON SELLING IT OR USING IT ) THIS IS A SMALL LOAN FOR 1800.00 NOT A 50,0000 OR HIGHER LOAN.ITS ALRIGHT ITS THEIR LOSS NOT MINE BECAUSE THERE IS ALOT OF OTHER LOAN COMPANIES THAT WILL BE HAPPY TO TAKE MY MONEY FOR BORROWING SHORT TERM FOR EMERGENCIES.DONT WASTE YOUR TIME UNLESS YOU LIKE GIVING ALL YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO A SMALL PAYDAY LOAN COMPANY WHICH I JUST WOULDN'T RECCOMEND TO DO. ESPECIALLY SINCE COVID AND PEOPLE OUT OF WORK AND PEOPLE DESPERATE FOR MONEY.NO WAY! I WOULD ONLY USE A COMPANY THAT NEEDS THE BASIC PROPER INFORMATION. ANYTHING MORE I WOULD BE VERY LEARY AND SUSPICIOUS..ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE GUARANTEED INCOME COMMING IN ON A REGULAR BASIS COVID OR NO COVID.AND OPT OUT OF COMPANIES IF YOUR NOT PLANNING TO USE THEM AGAIN..AND FYI  A SUPERVISOR NEVER CALLED ME BACK EITHER.THANK YOU CASHNET USA FOR SHOWING ME WHO & WHAT KIND OF COMPANY YOU REALLY ARE..",1
The worst rip off ever,I have been a customer for a few months never had a issue until now I made payments but I’m being told I’m confused you can’t confuse math my availability should be more but going over the math 4 times with 4 different people including a manager they are still not caught all they way up mentally so I will never NEVER NEVER NEVER MESS WITH YOU AGAIN EVER your not sensitive to customers during this Rona and you think ur high credit line help no Go play in traffic all of you,1
CashNet did not submit my ACH in…,its good to get some money but paying back five thousand dollars in interest no no thank u never again good that i had to work sommore to pay this off and they dont give u the chance till u pay about a 2000 dollars in interest to pay it off.... done payed.. cost me about 4000 had a whole year to go 404 a month,2

lied to me about the funding time,"cash net is great for a payday loan only. if they offer you a line of credit do not i repeat DO NOT!!!! take it. They offered me a 2,000 credit line with the interest rate at 299% annually which i had no knowledge of until i called and asked.You will be paying back 4 times more than you borrowed. It is a set up and unfortunately i was suckered. They don't explain to you that the interest is accrued $10 daily regardless of your due date. ex: If your payments are 175.00 bi weekly only $75 will be applied to your principle $100 towards interest but by the time your next due date the $10 daily interest had accrued. It is will take me 18 months to pay off this TRAPPED loan.  These people are a rip off. i will look into filing a class action suit . i do not recommend applying for line of credit with CASH NET. Stick to a normal payday loan only if its an emergency.",1

Offered me many loans via email and…Don't trust or count on them,I've paid back my loan twice now. The virus hit me hard and these people decided for the second time to overdraft my bank account.  I called twice in one day to arrange payments.  Then they just take one hundred dollars out of my account!!!! What a joke!!,1
Quit showing your commercial if you don't offer,"Warning!!! Never Ever get a loan with these people no matter how much you think you need it. I promise you will totally REGRET it before you’re done paying it back. RATES are outrageous, payments RIDICULOUS, not knowing your upcoming payment amount UNHEARD OF until just before due date, understanding why you’re expected to make the upcoming due payment when you’re scheduled to make an arranged payment that was set up, but they’re still expecting a monthly payment as well, if I was able to make a regular payment there would be no need to make a payment arrangement in the first place. You may have paid the borrowed amount back but it doesn’t end there, trust their system, you will pay much more than you expected unless you just pay what they tell you is the balance in full at once. My advice to new APPLICANTS, DON’T DO IT, DON’T DO IT.",1
Interst rates is ridicolous,"I’m hoping anyone who sees this actually heeds this warning, I took out a $1250 loan with this company about 7months ago, and have paid them back close to $4000 in that time yet somehow I still owe $1000. I made a $500 payment and only $200 went to my outstanding balance and the rep told me that the rest went toward interest. They don’t want you to pay this loan off. They want to take whatever money they can from you until you can’t stay afloat anymore and offer you to draw more credit. Don’t get a loan with this scam of a company.",1

I tried  to call 3 times. Asked for a manager. Was told manager would call me back. Instead received an email at 09:30 pm NO phone call; email read  it’s too late to call now, call us back tomorrow if you need more assistance. Called the next day to start the same process. Still have not spoken to a manager while they keep charging interest in a fictitious balance. Very shady company.",1

DON'T DO IT...ITS NOT WORTH IT,This line of credit is an easy quick source of funding but it is highway robbery. The amount of interest these thief's charge should be illegal. Its absolutely ridiculous. I strongly suggest you try all other options before this one.,1

They continue to add daily interest which they say just started in April 2020. During a pandemic when people are out off work. Makes no sense! You make a payment to lower your balance and then the next day it increases again. Almost like something that never ends. They dont want you to pay off they'd rather keep you in debt. Very frustrating and inappropriate.,1

This is a PREDATORY loan american…,This company is such a racket do not use them. You can find better ways of accessing cash. They charged me over $450 to use $1700 for 17 days. I am reporting them to whatever agencies will listen to me. They are doing nothing but taking advantage of people who find themselves in a bad situation. Shame on them. After seeing the response? I just want to say that I have contacted your company and I was not satisfied with the response. I asked for a copy of the contract that I signed and I have not received it.,1
Cashnet is one of the biggest crooked…,I am submitting another bad review because I still cannot access my account. This is complete and utter BS. I cannot see how much I still owe nor how much my monthly payment will be. I feel as if this is illegal.  I used to love this company but not anymore.,1
"A Thief Company, Don't borrow or YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!",Cashnet USA cut my available credit in half during a global pandemic.  Customers will never forget this and other company's conduct during this crisis!  I guarantee all the good reviews on here are FAKE!  You have lost a valuable real-life customer.,1
I will never borrow money from them…,"It was fast, but as I'm counting my monthly payments, I'm paying more then 100% intrest, which means you have to pay double of your loan amount and it's alot. I won't recoment this for anyone.",1
I regret taking a loan from them,"Awful period... the interest is ridiculous you will never get finished paying them, when I’m done I wont be dealing with them again.",1
I have been a CNUSA customer for 5 years,"I use  to love this company. A little expensive but okay. That is until they switch my loan from a payday loan to a line of credit. The line of credit adds interest to your account everyday depending on how much you borrow. My loan adds between 40 and 50 dollars daily for a month. By the time my payment comes out only a couple of dollars goes toward my loan, the rest is interest. With my payday loan I always made 4 payments and it was paid off. Do not except lines of credit.  If they don't do payday loans in your state please consider another way to get the money you need.  They are worst than loan sharks. I wish I had read the terms first  but I just assumed it worked like the payday loans. Been with them for years. I called a said I couldn't make my payment of 347.00 dollars so they told me I could pay 128.00. When payment came due, they charged me the 128.00 plus the 347.00. How was that for help. If I could afford the 347.00 why would they think I could afford 2 payments at once. That was almost 500.00. My account paid it and I had an over draft fee.PLEASE RECONSIDER YOUR OPTIONS BEFORE DEALING WITH THESE PEOPLE.  If it's a payday loan that's fine but PLEASE DON'T DO A LINE OF CREDIT. IT SHOULD BE ILLEGAL FOR THEM TO DO THIS.",1

I give you a five star review for…,It was very easy getting a loan but it has been a hassle trying to get logged in to check my account. I will not be using this company for future needs. Very unacceptable.,2
To review all of this CashNet USA is…,payments broke down keep you paying more over time than structured payments. Makes perfect sense to keep a person on the hook. If you don't need a 300% interest loan don't do it!! I dont have any questions for you. I understood the interest rate i understand repayment what i did not understand is fluctuations in payment that didn't even cover the principle and then one that did I'm sorry but steady payment of the same cost across the board is kinda a practice that needs to be adopted by screwing you out of a lower payment to not even cover the principle at all is kinda a poor way to extend a loan well past the payoff time. Food for thought.,1
Fees more than a loan and high…,Normally I like this company but my account has been under review for like 2.months so I cant login and they can't tell.me whats going on. My account is always paid on time..so what is the deal?,1
Terrible I write my email and after…,"I'll start with the positives first. . .The application process was super easy and the funds were deposited into my account the next business day!  Now for the real story. . . for the $1350 that I borrowed for an emergency, I have made $1300 in payments over the last 3 months and the balance is STILL $1377.  Needless to say, I will be making additional payments from now on with a goal to pay this thing off ASAP!!!  I would only recommend CashNetUSA as a LAST resort if you know that you will have a windfall of cash in the near future to pay them off because an APR of 299% means most of your payments are going to interest.  This type of predatory lending creates a cycle of debt that is very difficult to break.",1
If I could give this company no star at…,This company refused me a loan after I had several loans with them and paid them off. Never late on payments. Nothing has changed on my stuff but they still declined me. What company does business like this. So it dont matter if you are a good customer any more.,1
Limited funding.,This company  does not help. you pay back 10 times more than what you receive even if you try and pay extra it takes your extra payments and doesn't apply it to you account. Sorry but not sorry!!!! Then once you talk with customer services they have  very nasty attitudes.,1
CNUsa great for in a pinch,HIGHWAY ROBBERS!!!! PLEASE DO NOT TAKE A LOAN OUT WITH THEM!!!,2
I got a letter in the mail saying I was…,"I DO NOT recommend using this loan company . This is a complete rip off . You pay way more back  than what you borrow .

Great  service and friendly customer…,"No way this many people can be happy with this company. Fake reviews, please read the negative reviews as well. Before agreeing to the terms make sure you read the terms carefully. It’s a 299% interest rate folks. 299%!!",1
Its worst service compare to…,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE. THEY TAKE YOUR MONEY AND OVER CHARGE AND THEY'RE NO HELP. NEVER TAKE OUT A LOAN WITH THESE CLOWNS.I THOUGHT THEY WERE A GOOD COMPANY. BUT NO HORRIBLE. I CANT SAY THIS ENOUGH HORRIBLE.,1
299% apr,Outrageous interest rate and payment setup that makes no sense. Do not make your situation worse by borrowing money from this company. Most of not all of the 5 star reviews are fake. This business prays on the poor and keeps you in the hole and in debt to them. If you can pay off your loan with them and go to a credit union. This company is setup to keep you making payment that do little to your principle balance because the interest rate is sky high. It should be illegal what they do but I’m sure some lobbyist has paid off senators to keep them in business. I got $1400 and when I started paying it off they lowered it to $1100 and said it was due to Covid. So at a time of crisis you lower my line of credit. Ended up paying back over $3000 in just 6 months and that was because I paid it off early. Not worth it. Please listen to my review and steer clear.,1
They have some great customers willing…,They are taking more from you than they are actually helping you. They putting you in more debt than what you started with before borrowing. The interest is being charged every single day of the billing cycle which is a complete RIP OFF. They add extra to the interest and it make it impossible to pay them off. THEY ARE BASICALLY LEGAL ROBBERS.,1
After messaging my loan approval and to…,"They aren’t worth 1 star.  Horrible company.  Trust me, you don’t need money that bad.  What they charge for repaying the Absolutely undoable.  And they tell you that they will give you extra time on a payment—nope, they tell you they cannot.  I cannot believe they are 4.5 stars.  I don’t know who they are getting to do their reviews.",2
To be honest this is not like a credit…,"I have paid over $1400.00 in a months time on my loan. The information on Cashnet's portal is not kept current.They keep charging daily interest on the balance owed from the previous month. Trying to speak with any customer service they do not have the current information either. I have been told 3 different answers why my account was not current. It takes 2, 3, 4, business day's for Cashnet's system to clear a payment. In checking my account my last payment in the amount of $4270.00 has not posted as of 5/27/2020, payment was made on 5/15/2020. My account was behind due to the loss of work due to the corona viruse. payment arrangements were made. I caught my  account up on 5/8/2020. Their system did not see the account was current , so on 5/20/2020 their system took out a $99.00 payment. This after paying $1300.00 in a months time. For get about trying to get a hold of any live supervisor. and if you call in and you're over 50 you get connected to a solicitation for life alert not a live customer service rep. I will never use Cashnet nor would I recommend Cashnet. according to my accounting, and I run my own small business, cashnet owe's me because they have taken more than I owe,",1
Horrible service and they were very…,They use to have loans up to $600 but not no more with no reason why.  I have used them for 2 years and never missed a payment.  Not Happy.,1
The application was easy and approved…,"Please take heed to what I’m about to say! If you need money and have the means to pay it back in full within 2 weeks,  then by all means do it. But the reality is people who need money are not in a position to pay it back in full. This company preys on the low income people because they know they can’t pay it right back. This loan is meant for repayment within a few weeks to keep from getting those ridiculous customary fees. It should be against the law to charge the amount this company charges. My customary fees are over $10 per day plus $1.00 of interest per day. It’s outrageous! You can’t pay towards the original balance, it doesn’t work that way. If you pay more, it’s eaten up by the high customary fees. Just pay it in full and be done with them.",1
Thanks for the help!!!!,"This company is horrible to borrow a loan from. What they don’t tell you is for $100 borrowed they add on $15. On top of that you gain interest every single day to the remaining balance. My loan was $850. After the additional $15 it was about $985. I have already paid $1075.15 back. But due to the amount increasing by 0.8192% every single day I still have to pay $742 back. That amount will increase every day until my next payment date I set up with automatic payments. DO NOT GET A LOAN FROM HERE. I make 2 payments every month and it’s never a flat amount, each time the amount I am paying is different from the time before. This company is a total scam. Do not fall for the reviews on their site. I’ve asked a customer service rep for help explaining this process and they did everything to try and avoid my questions by repeating the same thing over and over and then had the audacity to ask if I could pay the remaining balance today. If I could why the heck would I have taken out a loan?!",2
Cashnet failed to support it's customers,"Beware! This company doesn't deserve one star! Apparently my account has been under review and when it's ""under review"" you cannot access it but in the meantime they continue to charge me interest fees and late fees. Their  customer service has the worst attitudes. Please do not do business with this company.  Shady is an understatement!",1
"don't worry, they'll pay to have this removed",High interest loans. You pay so much more back. So make extra payments. I will NEVER take a loan out with cashnetusa again. Two representatives gave me misinformation leading to a surprise charge when this whole time I thought the loan was paid in full. Customer support and their representatives are useless.,1
This company has been drafting payments…,If I would have known what I know NOW; I NEVER would have taken this loan. I borrowed $1000 dollars in December 2020.. I have been paying from $120- $140 every two weeks ($230-$250 a month). I checked my balance today 05-14-20 and it’s $730. This company is a RIP OFF.I called to see if I could set up 3 payments for my balance to pay it off and the young lady told me I couldn’t do that. I had made a payment on the balance of $750 and only $35 went towards the balance. I will NEVER pay this company off!!! THEY ARE A RIP OFF!!!!!!  WHATEVER YOU DO; DO NOT TAKE  OUT A LOAN WITH THEM!!!!! I took this loan out in December 2019 for $1000 and I still owe them $750.....I’ve been paying $200-$250 every month!!!! RIP OFF!!!!!!,1
I wouldn’t do it again but,"This is the most horrible thing I have ever done in regards to receiving a loan. I know now I am a sucker and did not read my contract carefully. Companies like this should be SHUT DOWN!  They take advantage of people in need. This is my story- I borrowed 2000 and realize now I will pay back over 3500. Of course, it will be less if I can pay back more each month. I can't do this so therefore, I will pay over 3500.The interest rate is outrageous. Read carefully and Please do not use this company or any other one like it!! You will regret it! I hope this helps anyone thinking about using this company!!",2
These people prey on the needy,"Don’t buy into these fake reviews. Be sure to read the fine print. Their interest rate is ridiculous, 299% to be exact. I would recommend using another source if it’s a high loan- it’s not worth it. They whole “the money was in my account the next day” is only beneficial if you have a pressing need, but you will ultimately suffer in the long run. Stay away!",1
Beware interest rates!,RUN!!!  Borrow from literally anyone else!!!,2
Absolutely ridiculous,I paid them off and they still charged my account 4 days later . Made me over draw my account. No fun.....,1
They Did Absolutely Nothing For Me..I…,Terrible!! Don't get suckered into this! Needed money for a family medical emergency and the quick loan helped but solving one problem created five more! In four months of paying every two weeks I have paid back the loan but with the insane interest all the money I've paid has barely touched the balance. Every penny has gone towards interest! This is terrible! Save yourself from making the same mistake I made by taking this loan!!!,1
Shady,"I would not recommend Cashnet., only because with the interest rate of 299% they have been paid over the value of my orginal credit line. Right now I'm paying over 200 dollars and they charge 168 dollars interest for the month. I have had my credit line over a year. They have always been professional and while I needed the money this type of credit line in the end becomes a greater debt than the orginal reason for my request. I would highly recommend a traditional loan and if you can't get one borrow from family and pay them back. Exhaust all your possibilities before considering a credit line even if you have bad credit. If it weren't for the ridiculous 299% interest rate they would other wise be fine. In addition in light of COVID 19 you'd think the company with all the money they have made would bring the interest down to a traditional one to help their customers instead they reduce the credit line line which isn't horrible but the monthly cost still...is outrageous. Please look at your options before coming to this company. The people who own this company are not generous, this is purely business and they are not a life line to your financial problems.,this is business and you need to seriously consider that when looking for money for a short term problem.",1

"Bait and switch ,","Wish I could given only ONE star.  This company has made A LOT of money off of me over the years because I went through a divorce and my credit was shot.  I always paid off my loans faithfully and was eventually extended a line of credit of $2500.   Imagine my surprise when the pandemic hit and out of no where, my credit was reduced to $1600 with no warning.  Mind you, I am a single parent, working as a nurse on the frontlines, and I needed all the resources I could get.  As it turned out, I was eventually furloughed, so I got unemployment and this was the first debt I paid off. I asked for my account to be closed immediately as I refuse to give this company one more penny. My credit is good now, so bye bye outrageous fees!  I hope this company suffers as much as they made their loyal customers suffer.  Take heed, Cashnetusa, bad business leads to bankruptcy. Please don't patronize me with your cookie cutter response.  I already emailed your ""support"" team and got no response then, so don't ask for my input now.  You just got it.PS. Thanks for the canned response I said I didn’t want 🙄.

BE AWARE!!!!!,"I was in a tough situation and borrowed money from this lender in Jan 2020! I wish I never had! Their interest rates are horrible!

I tried seeking help from this company to get help paying them off with a social security check coming in monthly and they would offer no help at all, just saying that I signed the contract to deal with it.  I would NEVER suggest anyone to borrow from this company unless you're rich enough to pay them off before the due date and pay their fee and interest for the amount you borrow in full the first month. Otherwise you get yourself into a vicious cycle where the is no light at the end of the tunnel. Again, DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.",1

Understand that your interest rate is per day, so if you have a balance of say 1675.00, the interest on that can accrue upwards of 177 - 180 for a 2 week period, which means you are practically paying about 500 a month, and very little of it goes towards paying off your principle.  So unless you can pay off that amount immediately or borrow less than 200., IT IS NOT WORTH IT!!!!",1

Which makes no sense because my bank status, credit, and income never changed.     I'm blessed to be able to work from home.

I have had no problem taking out 600.00…,"Very unprofessional. I overpaid the balance showing on thier website by more than $100. After showing my payments my new balance was over $200. How does $822 minus $1016 equal $216? I called to get some answers. The first rep had no idea what she was doing but was nice and clearly put into a position without proper training. After not being able to answer that math question she said her supervisor would call me. Before I go on note that interest is charged daily. The next day (there was around 6 hours left in the curent day) around 10:00 AM I get a call from Alana the manager while I was with a client of my own. I asked if I could call her back. Maybe 30 min later I call. I am told she would call me right then. She didn't return my call that day. I called again asking why no call. I'm told she would call me in ""less than an hour"". Still no call. Today she calls. Understand that I don't really care for my given first name and have gone by my middle name for about 45 years. After I point out this fact Alana, or as I shall refer to as Lucy, calls me by first name every time she speaks and tells me that she has to. That's just the rudest thing I have ever heard of. Back to the point. Lucy tells me that I should have taken a screenshot of the web page showing the $822 balance and since I didn't have that she wouldn't do anything. So I am left with having to pay over $200 more plus $5 of interest charged while waiting for Lucy to do nothing. I knew going in that this was a high cost loan but it was a 90 day turnaround that I was ok with. I had no idea that I was going to get gouged and treated like crap.Don't use CashnetUSA!ALLEN",2

I realize that this is a company that helps those in need with not the best credit score. And if you need a small amount, and can pay it back quickly, it's ok. But, dont be fooled by the bi weekly payments.  Very little of this money is used towards your principal. DO NOT MAX OUT YOUR LOAN!! My issue with this company is the lack of training they provide to their employees.  No one can explain why your balance is what it is, which leads me to believe that Cashnet currently has some possible fraudulent activity going on. CASHNET IS NOT BBB ACCREDITED. When Covid-19 hit, Cashnet immediately decreased everyone's actual approval amount. This company does not care about being there in your time of need, nor do they care about their customers. SHAME ON THE CEO, AL GOLDSTEIN, AND HIS SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM! Fortunately,  I  was able to pay my loan off quickly, and did not suffer as most have from their dealings with this company.

It sucks and I do not like it I cannot…,"This is a crooked place to take a loan from. I would advise you not to, but I had no options. It doesn't matter how much you pay down as you still pay the interest rate based on taking out the complete loan. Mine was a $1,000$ loan. Every day it added 8-10$ to the principle. I paid down 200$ towards it and same amount each day. I paid another hundred towards it a day later and same amount put back on the card each day. It's down to 776$ this past Sunday and I look at it now and it's back up to 826$. That's a crooked rate but they can do that because of how POS the place is. I put down 300$ more towards it but will just pay the thing off with my next check and never come back to them. There are laws in place that protect consumers from BD interest rates like this but I guess that doesn't apply to this type of company. It's the reason why they don't report to credit agencies. It's very shady and if I were you I'd sell something or put something you own up for collateral at a bank. This is the old mafia way of doing business. That's my honest review.
