Not my typical good review,"I usually leave entirely positive reviews because I have had great experiences with your amazing staff. But this last visit to the store wasn‚Äôt up to the usual standards and it deserves to be noted. You cancelled a product that many of your customers used without any notice, explanation or warning. We were ultimately forced do the new loan, because we counted on the previous product and it‚Äôs much more expensive, that upset me, because I would‚Äôve shopped around for the best rates and I didn‚Äôt have that opportunity. Plus, everyone walking in has to be there 3x the normal time, if no one is in front of you. I took me an hour and a half when I‚Äôm used to 15 minutes. I would‚Äôve planned differently. Bridget handled it flawlessly and was still her usual cheerful and helpful self.

Even when I wasn't sure I what day I was going to get paid that week they let me know that I would be ok and gave me a day or 2 just in case. Then after I got my direct deposit from my job I came it to pay my payment in full and Alison took care of me and I decided to get another loan that was much easier for me to do and for some reason their system wasn't taking my bank account number and I thought I wouldn't be able to do it and Alison was so patient and helpful and we both figured that I was missing 2 digits extra and she put it in and it worked (besides I learned something new to make sure I have the 2 other digits I need for my account lol ) I really enjoyed these 2 ladies professionalism and courteous attitudes they shown and understanding of my situation.

I love the ladies at my store,"I payd off my first loan in Fremont Ohio way early. I thought this would allow me more additional credit. I went to Michigan where on Hoover Rd michigan applied for a loan they approved me for only the same as before, $200 they processed a payday loan . The manager at this store promised I be able to go to a additional store in Michigan and be alloud to borrow a second loan . I travel there to my surprise they would not allow me a second loan . Then once to Ohio, the sore in lasky told me I was able to have one on line loan to my surprise I did every thing they ask of me and the in line sure would not give me the  option to borrow. I'm very upset and discouraged in the lack of correct procedures and running me on a goose chase it felt. I am still wondering why my one payday loan is in Michigan why I can borrow in Ohio now ??",5

I have been trying for over 2 weeks to get a increase on a loan I had been paying in good faith even in hardships, but at one point there was a missed payment, by one day, 2 months ago due to their fault of not automatically drafting it. I paid the next day when ai realize it wasn‚Äôt drafted, but they said it takes 6 on time payments to even be considered a increase. My next one was around the corner making it my 6th, I paid it a few days earlier to see if that would help and still no answers, nor help.These guys are not the go to guys for loans anymore, I would say. They‚Äôve had enough time and a early payment should have definitely meant something, but doesn‚Äôt in their eyes. Forget Advance America at this point. There are better ones than them.

But this month, with the holiday, YOU were able to get my money early!  You were paid back on the 2nd of September! Today, on September the 12th, I was finally able to get my new loan into the bank!  This is because I didn't ""ride the website"" with my normal immediate debit card  which allows me to payback my loan and immediately reapply the same day!  It was a nightmare!  Thankfully, my family covered the $255.00, or I would have had checks bouncing all over town!  I was NOT at all a happy camper, and I have been dealing with you for literally YEARS!  You took my money out YOUR WAY and made it impossible for me to immediately reapply the same day!",5

She seemed to be unable to get me out of there quick enough, clearly unattached from the fact that customers, as myself, are the reason she gets paid. We are her paycheck. As stated, the past experiences were better, so this rating is overall, but be ready to possibly deal with bad attitudes the whole process thru. Better luck to you!",5

It was quick and easy,"This was my first visit to a new Advance America store, one closer to my residence. Able to complete my transaction flawlessly. Wonderful experience.",5
Polite and very efficient in her work‚Ä¶,"I am a returning customer.  I recently paid off my loan.  I decided that I needed another one, so I came to Advance America first because I had a good experience with my previous loan.  I anticipated this being a quick and easy process, but that was not the case, as it turned out. When I first submitted my new application (nothing had changed), I was initially offered $1500.  As it turned out, I only needed about $900 but it was good to be offered more than I needed.  As I went through the process, and came to the bank verification, the system never could connect with my bank, so I decided to follow the alternate route of sending in my check stub (pay advice).  I sent it in as directed, and suddenly I was only offered $150.  This was very frustrating and I could find no reason for the dramatic decrease in my offer.  Even after calling customer service, they just said there was nothing they could do about the amount offered, and they refused to look any further into the matter.  I was quite disappointed in customer service.  I still do not understand why the offer was so low, but I was in a bind, so I went ahead and accepted the offer of $150.  Can you explain why all of this happened?I would love to revive my confidence in using this company in the future.",5
Good service,"Your online service is lacking. After several attempts To email, chat to no avail! I requested a change to payment to make the process faster and was told to wait from the 1st to the 9th! There has to be an opportunity here for improvement.",5

Great Service,Thanks for the quick cash it got me what I needed and only took about 20 minutes of my day,5
They were there when I needed them!,"I have used advance america for a few years now off and on. I really appreciate that the entire process can be handled online. From application to approval to payments. Anytime I‚Äôve been unable to make a full payment or a payment at all, all I need to do is call and the customer service agents are so friendly and helpful with a payment arrangement. The negative reviews I see are from people who don‚Äôt really understand how companies like advance america work. They allow people with bad or no credit access to EMERGENCY funds (this is not to be used for bar money or clothes shopping) but you are going to pay a huge fee for their risk. Understanding that up front will make for a really positive experience.",5
My review,Quick easy and great payment plan,5

Everything went smooth,"Awesome Company To Do Business With . I have been dealing with this company for 13 years, Hawthorne Location was well as the Covina Location . both Locations are great",5
Margret was awesome,"I initially took out a payday loan with this company, which I successfully paid on time. Then the clerk had presented me with a line of credit, which she I could barely hear her, and she kind of sped through the loan. They do all agreements online, which I signed on this tiny device. I went online to check the account which I thought the interest rate was reasonable. I though this was cool and had planned on paying off the loan in two installments. I didn't realize they were charging me an exorbitant interest rate, and the loan amassed $375.45 in interest charges in the first month. Initially, only $25 was shown to have been applied to the principal. I missed the first payment, then I paid towards the second payment. They started generating random checks each month without my knowledge or permission, a few days prior to the due date to ensure that they receive their money on time. I had other bills that I needed to attend to, and their collection practices are predatory. I found out that the state I live in, they weren't supposed to have me as a customer. I'm in another state. I'm glad that I will no longer be using them as a lender, nor will I recommend them to anyone else. When they took my loan into default, I was under the impression that they were to negotiate with me on making a payment arrangement. The loan went into default after one month of being late. If I could give them zero stars, I would. According to the CFPB this type of behavior from a predatory lending institution is not uncommon. Once, I've made arrangements to take care of this bill, I will never do business with this company ever again.",5

They prove to be very helpful in advance,"No longer give a good grace period. Not happy about that.

NOT HAPPY WITH THE SERVICE NOW. I think they have lost me as a recurring customer.",5

When the money didn't arrive, I called customer care and they said I would receive the money into my checking account on August 9, 2022. Instead, I never received my money. My daughter received her money on August 10 without her referral incentive. I called again to customer care and was placed on a 29 minute hold before I hung up. They keep saying that the money was sent. However whenever I checked my account, the $200 deposit was not there. Then, Advance America continues to send me ways to pay back the money! That's not going to happen because I never received the money. Called them several times and I still don't have the money. At least give my daughter her $20 that you SAID you would for her referral (me).This company has continued to tell me that they're so sorry about that! I forgive you but I'm not dealing with you anymore! Wish you the best! Deuces!",5

You help me every time  and help me‚Ä¶,The agent was very helpful with explaining the documents needed,5
I could always count on advance america‚Ä¶,I have had nothing but a good experience with Advance America. Except I have found paying the loan off is not as important as paying the monthly amount of payments. When someone gets a loan pays it off then tries to get another so the person can pay off other debts and they only give you 250 dollars less then the loan before then it keeps you from taking care of the debts that you are trying to get rid of. Buy the debts are my fault. But. All in all this loan service is pretty fantastic. Good people trying to help. Thank you for what you have done to help me climb out of a terrible situation.,5
Fast and easy.,My experience has been good. I think you should be more upfront on the process of turning the payday loan into a loan with payments. Instead after so many payday loans you get something on the last page that mentions an easy payment option. If your doing a loan on line it's easy to over look.,5

Everybody here at Advance America great‚Ä¶,"Fast, Quick, and Easy.  Always there with the extra to make ends meet.",5
The ladies in the D'Iberville store are‚Ä¶,"I received superb, professional customer service from the staff at Advance. However, the cost of repayment was far more money than I can afford. It was necessary for me to rescind the loan within the 3 business days provided by law, and made possible by a dear friend. It left me wondering --what has all this ""payday lnder reform"" accomplished?  Perhaps the interest rates are lower cumulatively. but the payments per 500$ loan have more than doubled which is prohibitive for people like myself on fixed income. Micro-loans are a needed and necessary part of a sane society that acknowledges the terrible wealth gap. But whoever pushed for middle class laws affecting the poor left common sense and affordability of repayment completely out of the equation. ADVANCE should be proud of the professionalism of their employees--but however the only loans proffered to me by computer algoritms did not adjust  to lower monthly rrepayment, becasue when the amount borrowed was decreased, the payback term of payment also decreased..VOILA! virtually the same cost to repay a smaller loan rather than longer time to repay resulting in smaller monthly repayment  increments Not user friendly , Advance.  You can do better.",4
Excellent services!,"KUDO'S  -""praise and honor received for an achievement.""I rarely write reviews but I think this company deserves the highest KUDO'S that can be offered in today's business world. The staff (Pat and Tera), both approach each customer straight from their hearts. They want you to have your loan as bad as you do. I haven't met the company execs, but I've found that this type of attitude flows from the top down.  I hope you can keep your generous approach to helping people. Particularly in these stressful times where folks are trying to keep their body, soul, and family together.",5

Thank you so much,I just love this company.  I started out using the Dunnellon branch.   The staff there is very friendly and knowledgeable.   Then they showed me how I can apply online so I  don't have to come down to the store.  Here's another reason why I love AA.  If you go to Amscott... you must give them a check. which means you have to find a branch  near you.   And when you only get paid monthly they onlyallow 2 weeks to be paid back. No working with senior peeps.     Thanks AA for helping when I need it.  Cindy T,5

I am doing online now because the‚Ä¶,"Your Three Rivers, Mi store was its usual self; friendly people and good service, always a pleasure. Your store on S. Westnedge Ave in Kalamazoo was another story. When I got there it was apparently closed for lunch with the sign indicating that it would not reopen for over an hour. Some people had been waiting for a half hour when I got there. When a worker returned I had been there for a half hour, others over an hour. What really cheesed everyone off was the fact that they didn‚Äôt reopen for another 10 minutes or so and apparently there had been someone inside all along and she breezily told us it would be about 15 more minutes as she apparently was just going to lunch. By the time the young lady finally reopened, there were about 8 of us waiting outside in the heat, one lady almost passed out. I‚Äôve never seen crap like this in one of your stores before and if I experience anything like it again I‚Äôm taking my business elsewhere. I don‚Äôt know what the problem is with keeping help, but if you‚Äôre going to train somebody after a holiday weekend, especially when most people couldn‚Äôt re-borrow because of Michigan law and had to wait until the weekend was over, you should at least take that into consideration and staff accordingly. Though I must say my friends in Three Rivers had no problem and gave their usual prompt and friendly service.",5

The Manager @ the 5140 Foothills Blvd‚Ä¶,I had an bad experience someone was acting like they worked for the company sent me an approval letter telling me I was approved for a loan but then asks for too much information as far as my bank login information which I find very weird because that has never been asked before normally they would call my bank for verification but he wanted all of my information and he stated I would get funded $657 that I would have to go into a store active a prepaid debit card and make a payment to them then I would get my loan I said that‚Äôs weird to me because what company asks for money up front so than he does my bank verification but some how I found out he was disputing transactions on my account and making it seem like it was from their company but it was actually  my bank crediting my account for transactions he disputed. He was texting me which I thought was weird and kept blowing up my phone for me to send money back and he was trying to rush me so I knew it was a red flag and changed all of my information because I felt he was a scammer his name is Brandon Day please be aware and please be careful he threaten to have my account negative if I didn‚Äôt send the money that actually belongs to me to him and legal action against me which I am not worried about because he‚Äôs a fraud and scammer,5

I complained again and still haven't heard anything from anyone about the way I was treated. Most unprofessional service I've ever received. This experience was so bad that I refuse to go to that location which was a half mile from my house and traveled 15 miles to get good service.  I contacted the BBB and left a review on Google  about this terrible experience.  I was contacted by the ""Pissed Consumer"" website about making a video about my treatment and how you guys never responded to this lady's terrible attitude about a complaint about a computer problem. Since I get no satisfaction from your management team,  I'll let it be known that you don't care about customers and to seek loans elsewhere.",5

Very helpful,My experience was great. Very friendly and very detailed about my loan. Would recommend them .,5
Great Service with professionalism,"THE WHOLE PROCESS WAS A NIGHTMARE.    First I went on line to get loan, then decided I would go pick it up myself. I was told that It would be ready to pick up in 3 business days. That was too long. I tried for some time to cancel the unfinished online loan process, but could not find a way to do it. Then I drove to Advance America on West El Camino, and was told they could not give me a payday loan because I already had a loan  ""IN PROCESS"" and I would have to drive home and finish it.    So I did, but was too upset to safely drive back to West El Camino, which is quite a distance away. So I went the next day and it was closed in the middle of the day. So then I drove back today and they said my loan went thru, but they didn't have any cash. . I asked it they could just deposit it in my bank account, but was told that he couldn't do that unless I  called the number he gave me and cancelled the loan. I tried to do that outside in the parking lot, but the Advance America lady on the line told me that "" YES, THEY COULD CANCEL THE LOAN IN PERSON AT EL CAMINO"", so I went back in. They couldn't, or maybe they just didn't know how.  So I ended up driving up and down Stockton Blvd for 45 minutes to find the other store in the heat. I had to call 3 times for direction, but at least they had the cash.    HOW IN THE H--- CAN A PAYDAY ADVANCE PLACE (West El Camino) RUN OUT OF CASH????? IT WAS STILL MORNING! And NO, they could not just transfer the loan to my bank. You folks must be really hard up for capable workers.This is way too much trouble to do business with Advance America. Poor management all around.",5

Melissa was very helpful and customer‚Ä¶,"Your customers come to you primarily because they need money to survive and because banks wont lend them money. It is very un likely that entrepreneurs get loans from you. Given that the excessively high APR, and fees don't help them. Typically, payday loan companies don't report ontime payments to the credit bureaus but they do report delinquencies to the credit bureaus. How fair is that?The terms and conditions are carefully designed to make it very difficult to make the required payments on time for customers who are already struggling to survive. There needs to be a balance between your company making a profit and really helping those in need. Companies such as your are service companies, aren't they?Every payday loan probably conducts business similar to you but it doesn't necessarily justify these business practices.",5

Maria and the other lady there showed‚Ä¶,"I was in need of a quick, last minute loan. Advance America made that happen! Although the starting loan amount was less than I needed, it still helped.

Customer service,"Always very friendly and helpful. Never seen anyone in a bad mood. The manager, I think, is always training and helping the new employees and taking care of the customers all at that same time. I saw her stand between 2 trainees, and communicate with customer at window and say hi and greet other customers as they entered..friendly, fun and professional. Also saw her handle a problem customer, who had been told numerous times that he needed a bank statement showing a positive balance, not a letter that he brought from the bank. From what I saw, she has told this man over and over again like 5 times, different days, and he just don't get it. He was waiting in lobby for his turn, and she asked him if he had his bank statement, no but I got this letter,  she said I'm sorry sir, but we have been through this many times, which then she was backed up by another saying, sir we have told you everytime you come in here, we cannot use that paper and you have been told what we need. We are sorry but we cannot help you again today",5

Great review of 5 for talladega s Advance America,"I must give mention and heartfelt gratitude to TyKeia at the Summer Store location in Memphis TN.  I recently lost my puppy, Roxii, after 12 years of companionship and love. My heart was heavy and broken. I was applying in hopes to put a down payment on another puppy. The care, concern and genuine care TyKeia gave me was above and beyond her duties. I am 69 yrs old and I never had a daughter, but I felt like I did that day. I didn't know her before and I have not spoken to her since, but I just had to tell you how valuable of an employee and human being she is. I'm sure that you get a lot of negative reviews as people are just on edge these days and I understand that as well. I pray that some people can remember the nice things that people do. The manager and the other employee was kind and friendly with everyone who walked through the door. I dealt directly with TyKeia, and after leaving her, I had renewed faith. Thank You for having a person like that in your company. You were very smart to hire her. God Bless You and thank you for your time.",5

This year I found myself in need of a loan, and applied for a loan not with my former cash advance place, but with Advance America. I was shocked when they only offered me $400 for an installment loan (I make very good money, have a fair credit score, own my own house, etc...). But I needed it that day so I got it. I will be paying the balance off this Friday when I get paid in lieu of the installment process....and next time I'll not use Advance America. Heck, even a payday loan would have netted me $500.",5

Ended up having to borrow more elsewhere, which cost me.   If your going to be a big loaner, you have to have cash on hand!!  Afraid I won‚Äôt use this company if you don‚Äôt provide your offices with sufficient amounts of money.  I think I should get my finance charges waived since I had to borrow somewhere else also!   On the positive, the young lady at the office was very pleasant and try different options to try to help.  She called your help center, and they tried to have me pickup cash hundreds of miles away.  Help center was no help for the young lady.",5

They automatically know this. But since you made changes to how they are suppose to process checks it caused me a bunch of grief. It caused me several trips to my bank and gas that no one can hardly afford today. I am not pleased with your company at all. There are many check writing places in New Albany, Mississippi but people chose yours. But doing this type of stuff to people is a good way to run off business. Your company is the only one who has ever done this to me.",5

I recently got a small loan for some‚Ä¶,"The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars are the crazy high interest rates. Makes it very hard to pay off an installment loan when you've paid $1400 and the balance has gone down by $200. Other than that, these loans are very easy to get and the funding is instant. Also you can make a debit card payment online instead of waiting for the ACH to go through and it applies the payment immediately. If you can pay off fast and save yourself alot of the interest its a good deal but if you can only make the minimum payment you will end up paying 4 times what you borrowed.",5

Awesome Managers Service,"I hadn't been in the office for a while, but needed a loan for some upcoming event. It was a pleasure to see the worker who has been there for me before. She's extremely pleasant. I usually ask her if she's been vaccinated yet. Prior to this time, she's reported no. I didn't ask her this time, because I've come to the conclusion that if she isn't vaccinated by now, nothing I could say (or nag about) would change that. I was just glad there was a see-through divider and I could keep my mask on without being harassed. I do wish Advance America would require vaccination of its employees, but that's life in America; it seems, that my understanding of common sense is not the understanding of the common sense of others. C'est la vie dans Les Etats-Unis, I guess. Be well and prosper! You guys come in handy in a pinch. And pleasantness counts for so much in this world :)",5

I ended up not picking up the money and instead ended up asking a family member for money because I had to work and used what little gas I had driving to these three locations, these hours should be reflected online so this doesn't happen to others, I understand its hard finding employees and people to work but this was definitely not an ideal situation.",5

Always an easy app for me.,"On Friday 3/25 I asked the store attendant (Dick Pond Rd, Myrtle Beach SC) if I take out a PayDay loan today, am I able to come in and 1) PAY that off on MONDAY and then 2) apply and get a Line of Credit loan that same day.  She said YES but gave me the customer service number to call in my payment.  Well today is MONDAY and no customer service rep can take my payment (not in system) and the local branch has no way to do it either (her systems are ONLY for lines of credit). I applied for the Line Of Credit which is $1000 BUT you can‚Äôt give me ANYTHING of that until my PayDay loan is paid.  I am going out of state on Wed and needed more funds before I left.  The online chat agent said it takes 4 calendar days before PayDay shows up for me to pay off.  Neither the local Myrtle each agent nor 2 at your customer service stations knew that either.",5

I kept receiving emails that I needed another selfie ID, I called several times and kept being told I needed something else, but the only email I received said selfie ID, then when I would login, it would have me verify by banking info, which I had done several times. The website is not very user friendly and makes it hard to deal with. It was very frustrating to go through that. The website/email system needs to change to be less confusing and state what is needed and allows us to only enter the information that is needed. I had to make several phone calls.

Advance America are the leaders in the‚Ä¶,"I should have done this review a week ago, but I am technically challenged and didn't know how. My review is regarding the store in Steubenville, Oh. On March 1st I needed money to take my fur child to the Vet for all of his shots and meds. Prior to my visit, I called the day before to see if I would qualify because I was still paying the $500 loan off. The rep was clearly busy, as evident by the conversation heard as I talked to her. She apologized telling me she would call me back. She did, at which time the policy regarding loans was explained professionally with the kindness I wish all CSRs had. I met her the next day, paid the balance of the open loan and was approved for another. Your company helped once more. I am most thankful, as is the dog, the Vet, all pet lovers! who do what we can to ensure the health of our pets. By the way, she was better in person than on the phone. GREAT EXPERIENCE!",5

Good job,Advance has helped for a long always great service . My Goal is to get out of the Advance America wheel im on this year with the Goals i have set.,5
The website crashes too often,Great place to get a little extra cash before payday. Also the woman who manages the location I go to is very kind and understanding we've got to know each other on a personal level I just love dealing with her. In fact after the 1st loan was paid back ive continued to get payday loans there and didn't need to at times just to keep having conversations with the manager at the location. And she knows that life can throw curve balls at us sometimes and we may not make a payment on time but as long as you communicate with her everything is just fine. She makes a note in your file of your conversations and when you will be able to make your payment. But I've recently found out the company is closing this location and my newly acquaintance friend is going to be out of a job. But she's not worried and in fact taking time off from finding another job right away. I'll miss you buddy all the best to you I know great things will come your way!!,4
The gentleman that helped me was polite‚Ä¶,"It has been awhile since I have needed some quick financial assistance.  Your office has updated with a lot of technology and a new boss lady.Well your boss is fantastic.  I'm 76 and not the best technology expert.

Fantastic service and the young lady was a technology expert on top of everything.

All I can say is that,I‚Äôve had to resubmit paycheck stubs multiple times. I use the verification system to link to my bank.

If I were a first time customer I would have just went somewhere else but I knew either I just got a bad rep or she must be new but even new should know better. I will still do business but now I‚Äôm a little hesitant about recommending. I don‚Äôt want my recommendation to have a bad experience like that.,5

Web site is Very easy to use,"While the young man in the store was wonderful - helpful, polite, professional, and efficient, the fact that I had to go to the store at all was extremely inconvenient, and the two ""people"" who attempted to assist me via Chat on your online platform were useless. I had already tried everything they told me to do. I could get to the point where my password was accepted, and it said, ""Welcome, Leslie, blah, blah, blah,"" then gave instructions to enter the verification code you would be sending. I received verification codes via text and email, and each time I entered them and clicked Verify, the yellow ""Verify"" box turned pale and no further action would occur. I understand that multistep authentication is being implemented to improve security, but perhaps you shouldn't roll it out until you've worked out all the bugs. This experience was a nightmare.",5

Friendly,"I was in Winnsboro, SC and found a Advance America location and decided to go in to get an advance. Since it was closer to me at the time. I was expecting the same customer service that I get from the Two Notch Road location. To my surprise, it was not at all what I am use to. To say the least the representative acted as if she didn't want to wait on me. The store had a be back at 3:00pm sign on the door and I arrived at 3:10pm the representative told. E she was still on break but would assist me. I should have left at that point, but gave it a try. The representative made it a point to me that all their customers get checks we don't keep cash. Not friendly at all. I should have known because it has been my experience that mostly all the people in the Winnsboro area are rude and unprofessional. I will Not go back to that location again. The two at the Two Notch Road location are very friendly from the time they unlock the door until they finish your transaction. Winnsboro has a bad representation for visitors and customer service.

Also, when paying back payday advances via direct debit, the system process it and then sends a text loan paid in full but then a few minutes later another text that says ‚Äúpayment returned‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt make sense. Other than that I would recommend AA to others.",5

I had very good service got the loan‚Ä¶,"Ever since you got the process available to do online its been amazing.  No more going to a store and standing in a long line and filling out a lot of paperwork. it's just a few minutes and the process is done. it's easy to upload any documentation needed and it's put right into my account. yes, the interest fees are a little high but for the convenience now it's worth it.",5
great customer service,"Applied for a pay day loan, gave verification of pay stub and received confirmation that document was received also received confirmation that loan application was in review.  This was all before 8:00 am.  Next thing I know I'm receiving an email stating that verification of pay was needed. I submitted the pay stub once again.  Received the same confirmations.  It asked me a third time!  Very ridiculous!!",5

Teresa was unprofessional and I know that to be true from our exchange. Overall in-store courtesy was 360 degrees from what I experienced on-line. Thank you, you get 5 stars!!! Not to be associated with Teresa...",5

Tiffany is awesome she went above and‚Ä¶,I have used these services for several years. The last few months have been the most disheartening and disrespecting. The Center I used was shut down without any warning. It allowed me to pay in the office but told me I would have to go to another office to reborrow.. This recent transactionI called and explained I had tested positive for COVID19 and if it was possible to complete the transaction over the phone including reborrow of the funds. I was told that I could. After the money was paid. I asked what did I need to do to reborrow. I was told i/could not be done. I explained that I was told I could. They explained that it could not be done. I said excuse me I asked you that before the transaction and you said I could.  They told me sorry for inconvenience let me transfer to customer support. I explained what happened and they said we don't do that. But I was told that initially and would have tried to make other arrangements.  I was told to go online and apply. Going online takes away from me being able to pay my bills as I have in the past. I feel thatI was misinformed and taken advantage of due to being in a situation beyond my control with COVID19.  As I stated I have used these services for several years even paid it out and in the process of doing it again. I explained before paying  I needed to pay AND reborrow. I was told ok. Then after paying told I could not. That's false information and I don't want to have the funds taken from my account. I would rather do as I have been down. I pay on time.,5

This is my second loan,"I was an in-person customer of Advance America a while ago, so I knew there was a 24hr wait time if you needed to renew the loan. Last week I did a loan online for the first time. The money was deducted out of my account yesterday and has cleared. Being 24 hrs later I tried to renew and was told by customer service I have to wait 3 business days. There was no mention of this that I saw online. They told me if I would have paid with my debit card prior to them taking the payment automatically then I could have renewed in 24hrs. Again, no mention of that either.  I asked if I can show them my bank statement showing that the payment cleared, they said I could but I would still have to wait 3 business days. Not very willing to assist. They have lost a customer.",5

Great service very pleasant,"I applied Thursday early afternoon. No one reached out or asked for anything. Come the next day, I reached out and asked if there was anything else I needed to do (again, had not and still haven‚Äôt received what was needed). I was informed an ID was needed. So I put that in. Later that day around 4:45 - 5 - I logged back in and it said it was approved! Awesome! It may take a little time. Then it tells me it won‚Äôt be available until the next business day (and weekends aren‚Äôt business days). After that, the site updates to tell me due to Mondays holiday, they won‚Äôt come through that day either. So now I will (maybe) be receiving the money into my account literally three days before I‚Äôm supposed to pay it back. How is that ok? Why was I not informed BEFORE hand? The site said nothing about that until after 5 on Friday. I can‚Äôt talk to anyone about it because you guys were closed all weekend apparently. I‚Äôd already  applied and was approved so I couldn‚Äôt go somewhere else, which forced me to have to wait, in silence, to hopefully be able to call on the 18th and explain the situation. I‚Äôll be honest, I was super relieved at first when it went through, then I found out all the other information and it instantly made me feel far worse. My opportunities were taken and I feel like the company took complete advantage of me in my time of need. I‚Äôm seriously upset about this. I didn‚Äôt need the money on Tuesday, on Monday, noR Sunday. I needed it Thursday or Friday, Saturday at the latest. Not a whole week later. At this point, it‚Äôs going to cost me even more money to borrow this money, AND I still got hit with late fees. Literally, this whole process and the lack of transparency has cost me about $150 in fees, not including the fee for this. I‚Äôm in a worse spot than I was. I really do feel like this was done predatorily. I‚Äôm not the only one who experienced this, and it makes me think it was done purposefully. The lack of communication, the fact I had to reach out to find out what else was needed, the fact the site said nothing about the 17th until after the fact, etc. I‚Äôm not trying to be rude, but this has caused a lot of problems when it should have been helping to solve them.",5
"Fast, üîê, and options.","My experience at the physical store location was great. The staff was helpful, and the service was fast. This is the only reason I gave 3 stars instead of 1. My experience with the online system and online application process, not so much. The online system was terrible, hard to navigate, not user friendly, and very aggravating. Not to mention the fact that after being lead to believe the loan was a done deal, there was additional verification I had to go through, which caused me to have to take more time out of my day, and undergo more stress. If I didn't need the money, I would have just given up. Website definitely needs improvement.",5

Everyone is always courteous and‚Ä¶,"When doing an online payday loan the date populated a day before my payday. I quickly reached out to the store in town that I had usually gone to about this. I let them know and the gentlemen said that he would have to manually change the date to the next day as he was unsure why it was populating that way and that I was not the only customer that had called about this concern. Unfortunately, he did not manually change the date and the loan went through a day before my payday causing my account to go negative. I was told there was nothing that could be done but I could purchase another loan the next day to help. I have been a long time customer and there definitely could‚Äôve been something done for the gentlemen‚Äôs mistake. But there wasn‚Äôt. Starting the new year off with a negative account was not ideal.",5

Jack is great!!,Keep up the great working helping  those people who are in the need of extra money or short on payday.,5
I have been very pleased with the‚Ä¶,"Bait and switch.  I had completed all of the paperwork needed to obtain a loan and then was told this location was closing so I would have to deal with either Des Moines or Marshalltown for payment of the loan.  I received no cash only a check.  I have no idea what was wrong with the printer but I folded the check and placed it in my billfold.  Upon arrival at the bank the ink was so smeared and illegible that the bank would not accept the check.  Upon return to the store I was told there was nothing that could be done until Monday.  On Monday I was informed that we had to wait 24 hours for the cancelation on the check. Staff should have informed me the location was closing before processing any loan information/paperwork to ensure I wanted to proceed.  The check printed and issued to me should not have and issue with smearing or rubbing off, like it did.  I should not have to had to wait 4 days to ensure the transaction had been cancelled and all business issues resolved.  This was by far the worse action I have encountered with payday loans in the last 20years of my life.  I can see why the location is closing!!",5

Don't believe their lies of helping Americans to advance in life. Because the only ones that Advance are the banksters, who are  true money loan shark gangsters.",5

Honestly,"I‚Äôd give a good review but I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôve been doing payday loans with you for years and have always paid off my loans. Every payday I pay off loan and apply for a long term loan and get denied. I‚Äôm borrowing $500 every 2 weeks and paying $88 in interest which equals $166 a month, if I can successfully maintain paying that, I should be able to have a long term loan. You loan companies are loan shark gangsters. I‚Äôm about to find other options and plan to never use your service any longer but I‚Äôm sure that won‚Äôt affect your company because y‚Äôall will take advantage of many others in a bind to make your harsh interest charges.  Y‚Äôall really act like you‚Äôre helping people but really just gangsters are given permission from our also gangster government.  Whoever reads these for the company will wear this on their shoulders and conscience as you know your company is wrong.  Eat crap",4

Love this location,"This is coming from a real Advance America customer, not a bot, not a paid client or anything else. I am a single mother of two teenage daughters. I live off of and support my family with my income as a teacher (which everybody knows doesn‚Äôt mount to a hill of beans unfortunately), but nothing else. I don‚Äôt receive child support or have income coming in from anywhere else. My rent is nearly half my monthly take home pay, so as you can imagine, money is beyond tight, and Lord help me when an emergency arises. I would get so far behind on everything if the slightest unexpected financial obligation popped up. I‚Äôm still working on building my credit from a divorce, so bank loans are not in the cards for me right now. The first time I became in dire straits, I searched and researched every possible avenue for finding a small loan to help me support my family and get me back were I needed to be. The best option I found to fit my needs was Advance America. The initial loan process was a bit tedious, but that‚Äôs only because I‚Äôm pretty introverted and I‚Äôm uncomfortable speaking to people in person at times. In reality and for everyone else, the initial process is a cakewalk lol. I have used Advance America since that first loan, and it‚Äôs been as easy as uploading a picture of my paystub and hitting ‚Äúsend‚Äù. I love that I don‚Äôt have to go through all the verification steps anymore. It‚Äôs so simple and they are always there for me in my time of need. The fees associated with the loans are by far the most reasonable fees anyone in my position could ever find. If I was an accountant, I‚Äôm sure I would be appalled by the fees, but then again if I was an accountant, I would be more financially stable and wouldn‚Äôt need Advance America either, so for me, I don‚Äôt mind paying the fees because it‚Äôs worth it when I need it. Anyone who complains about the fees honestly just needs to more appreciative and grateful that they are as low as they when compared to other payday loan companies. You won‚Äôt find any other company who‚Äôs fees are as reasonable as Advance America‚Äôs, who‚Äôs loan process is simple and quick, who can fund your account as quick, or who‚Äôs payback date is far out enough to give you the time to get yourself financially comfortable again. Advance America is a life saver. I highly, very very highly recommended them for anyone who finds themselves in my situation. It‚Äôs not a hand out, it‚Äôs a hand up, and they don‚Äôt take advantage of people in their times of vulnerability like the vast majority of payday, title, or small loan companies do. If you‚Äôre reading this review trying to compare other companies, or just deciding whether or not to pull the trigger on using Advance America for your loan needs, I‚Äôm here to say look no further and don‚Äôt hesitate. You will feel that relief that you so desperately need, and it‚Äôs not just an instant gratification then regret it later kind of relief either. It‚Äôs a thank Goodness for Advance America kind of feeling of relief that will not leave you ending up feeling disappointed. Honest review from a real customer here. I want to stress that because I know reviews can be misleading. I‚Äôm not here to mislead anyone, I‚Äôm leaving this review to help others who find themselves in desperate times like I have found myself in many times.",5

Julia was really  sweet,"I have been doing business with ""the other guys"" for about 2 years ago and they have so many loopholes and hurdles that you would think they want you to be late with your payment. Like you can not pay with both cash and debit card, its all one or the other. At Advance America, no worries, pay however you want. I had this issue first week in December where I could not pay my loan with ""the other guys"" and decided its just a hassle to do business here now. This is my second loan with Advance America and its been nothing but 5 stars and true customer service and satisfaction right from the start. On this particular loan, I dealt with Allen who far exceeded all expectations. Not only did he allow me to pay my loan with cash and 2 debit cards, which got the job done, his particular location closes at 2pm on Saturday. Not only did Allen stay late with another customer and myself still in the store, he still answered any phone calls that came into this location. He was on the ball, extremely professional, helped me beyond what you would expect, made sure I was able to pay my loan and apply for another and he moved with such precision that I was not sure how he did everything so fast. Kudos to Allen for all of his efforts. Unlike the other guys"" who start yelling at you if you were to walk into their location at say 145pm and they close at 2pm, to get out, they have to close at 2pm on the dot, etc. You get the idea. Doing business with Advance America is well, like a new America, where you are not just a loan or a number but are actually treated with the respect and dignity one would hope to be a recipient of from any payday loan company. Advance America has got the right vision looking forward and they obviousily train and instill into their employees, these same visions and how to treat another human  being and one that had something happen in their lives which brought them into the lobby of a payday loan lender. It is not the easiest thing to do and you have to swallow your pride but one has to do what one has to do. I expected no this, no we can't do that, etc. when I left the location of ""the other guys"" and came over to this Advance America location. Allen did not utter a single no to me and it was yes we can, yes we can, yes we can and I am happy to say I left with the new loan I needed to sustain my present living conditions.",5

I HAVE NOT HAD ANY PROBLEMS AND I GET‚Ä¶,"4 1/2stars! I would give Advance America 5 or more stars if: A lessor fee was charged for payday loans paid back with in 2 weeks. I only needed to get through 5 more days of the month but the same fee was applied. I am extremely happy with the service in spite of the one issue. Perhaps Advance America will consider implementation of a lessor fee for situations like mine in the future. If so I would have to give 10 stars! The website is easy to navigate and the response was immediate. Also, after approval, if the funds were not deposited right away I had (have) the option of canceling online and then applying again at the Advance America store near my home to receive the cash much sooner. I did not have to do this because luckily the funds I applied for Sunday night were deposited the next business day mid afternoon. Thank you! Please consider my suggestion for a lessor fee for loans paid back within 5 to 15 days! Respectfully A.C. Santa Barbara, Ca.",5

Was very friendly and gave me her‚Ä¶,"I used Advance America online recently, got approved quickly but never got my loan proceeds. After paying over $1100 for gift cards to obtain my loan, I gave up because they still wanted me to spend more money out of my pocket before I could receive my loan proceeds. Living on Social Security I really couldn't afford to lose this kind of money. Once I gave up they told me I wouldn't be reimbursed for my expenses of $1100 because I didn't receive the loan. I should mention that one of the reasons I had to purchase so many cards was after purchasing and sending the cards through both email or text message I was told the card was invalid. I checked the value of the last card I sent and 2 hours after Advance America confirmed they received the card, there were 3 transactions made (for $99.98 each) for one specific merchant. The card then had a value of $.06. Out of 6 cards I purchased either online or in store, only 2 of them were good according to Advance America.

The only thing I wish is that after a patron has proved themselves worthy with good payback history, they could increase the amount that you could borrow a little bit even if they had to break the payments up in two months instead of one I've often thought that I could use a little bit more than 450 and I've been an excellent Patron as far as paying back.

Cindy was a very happy and helpful‚Ä¶,"This company is not what they say they are. They are pushing trying to get people to buy bitcoin. They take all your personal information, and then they are wanting you to send them money back by either going to some store or through bitcoin. They do not work with you on this, they will not use any of the other sending money options that are well known and trusted, not even to gain a customer. One of the questions in the beginning of the process was if I use bitcoin. I said no, and asked why they ask that, and they would not respond to that. Then later I asked if they are a company that sells bitcoin, they stated no, but would not work with me any other way. Complete waste of time, and not good customer service at all. I spoke with Jason Green, Sr. Loan Analyst who just kept saying ok, ok, ok, ok.... I would not recommend this company to a person even if they were a last resort. They are not what they say they are and at the very least, they for sure have horrible customer service and are not willing to do anything more convenient for the sake of gaining a customer.",5

You guys are the best,I applied and requested an in store pick up - 1 arrived at 1130 after driving an hour and a half to the closest store and was told they didn‚Äôt have any money to fund my loan - no options were provided- I returned the next day and was told the same thing- I called customer service and was told they would provide a debit card or check - this process required 3 trips to complete and cost me $ 40 I‚Äôm gas and 4 hours of driving- the dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever heard was a loan Buisness that doesn‚Äôt have money,5
Okay the store that I deal with is run‚Ä¶,Terrible place. Do yourself a favor and give any other loan place a shot. I settled my account with them in June. I tried to apply for one today in October and they tell me that I have a unsettled account. Waste of time and gas. Mind you it wouldn‚Äôt allow me to apply on line. I called them to verify that my account was in good standing they suggested that I go to the store and my account was fine. Just for them to say my account is unsettled but they see I paid it off months ago so to try again in a few days. Unorganized and unprofessional.,5

Y'all did great üëç,"I was using a different online payday loan place (Check N Go) for a couple years and needed to borrow back the $255 for rent each month. Things were going smooth until last month the website (Pocket 360) kept saying ""Verification Failed"" and i couldn't log in, rent was due.Their Support made me take a screenshot of the Banner that wouldn't allow me to log in and send it to them, i did, easy enough. Then they sent it somewhere within their business and told me to wait for an e-mail that was suppose to arrive between 24 and 48 hrs. I waited 24hrs and contacted them twice each time their hands were tied and i was told to wait for e-mail..RENT WAS DUE so i called Advance America and spoke with Emily here in Redding. She let me know what paper work was needed for Verification. Because i kept all that important stuff together already i was at the store in 30mins.Thinking to myself oh god here we go again, something always goes wrong or back home for different papers. My mind was blown when we were done and i was out the door in under 30mins... They really stepped up when i needed it.. Thanks Advance America    Larry",5

I have had problems with your on line‚Ä¶,"Called in June 2021 to compare rates, spoke to a very knowledgeable man on the phone who gave the information to applying online versus in the store. Came in person in October 2021 after going to a competitor for a few months. Was given twice what the other place gave me, and up to 4 months to pay it back. I was loaned one-third of my gross monthly pay, based on your last paycheck only. Different man waited on me than on the phone, equally as professional. Nice to see all employees wearing masks and hand sanitizer for the clients. They have revolutionized the short term loan industry. Will recommend to friends. My advice to you, pay back early if you can or pay a little more than due each time so they are at least charging interest on a smaller amount, as you are saving a lot in interest if you do. You really do not want to pay that interest.",3

Service was great!!,My husband had made a loan through Advance America online. There was notes made at the store that it was not supposed to be taken out on the 8th which it said online instead the store put it for the 13th when my husband got paid. They had pulled the main girl from that store to another store for just a few days and the person that was there went ahead and sent it through our bank on the 8th instead of doing her job and reading the notes that was left for her. Now they say it takes 5 to 7 days great to get back to them and them reimburse us what's in the meantime I'm overdrawn because of it and I cannot use my debit card until Advance America gets this back to me. NEVER TRUST THE ONLINE,5

Quick simple application,"I have been working out of town on a project and made a special trip back to Michigan to reloan last Saturday October 2, 2021.

There was a problem and your system said I still had an open loan but SoM said they were all closed with the new online loan open. The store manager Lisa was on hold for 40 minutes with customer service trying to get this resolved. She never got through. Driving back to Michigan was a huge waste of a day.

I have been trying for over 2 weeks to get a increase on a loan I had been paying in good faith even in hardships, but at one point there was a missed payment, by one day, 2 months ago due to their fault of not automatically drafting it. I paid the next day when ai realize it wasn‚Äôt drafted, but they said it takes 6 on time payments to even be considered a increase. My next one was around the corner making it my 6th, I paid it a few days earlier to see if that would help and still no answers, nor help.These guys are not the go to guys for loans anymore, I would say. They‚Äôve had enough time and a early payment should have definitely meant something, but doesn‚Äôt in their eyes. Forget Advance America at this point. There are better ones than them.

This month I must have tried 4 times kept ending up saying to upload documents and I gave up. Plus then stopped at the local office and they were out to lunch and when I came back after they were to be open they still weren't there and there were 4 people waiting outside.  Then a day later all of a sudden the loan was in my account.  Something isn't right.  This was I believe started on 10/1/22 , stopped twice at the office on Monday Oct 3rd but didn't stay after second attempt nor did I have contact with employees. And it appeared in my account on October 4th.",2
They are a joke!,They fail to tell you everything upfront. I gave them the correct paydays when I got my line of credit and they put them in wrong. Then I did what they said paid it off not once but twice to correct my payments and then I called them to correct it and they tell me well you have to close it you can‚Äôt just pay it off!

NOT HAPPY WITH THE SERVICE NOW,"No longer give a good grace period. Not happy about that.

But this month, with the holiday, YOU were able to get my money early!  You were paid back on the 2nd of September! Today, on September the 12th, I was finally able to get my new loan into the bank!  This is because I didn't ""ride the website"" with my normal immediate debit card  which allows me to payback my loan and immediately reapply the same day!  It was a nightmare!  Thankfully, my family covered the $255.00, or I would have had checks bouncing all over town!  I was NOT at all a happy camper, and I have been dealing with you for literally YEARS!

My last loan payment Aug 7th 2022,"My last loan payment Aug 7th 2022, was not allowing me to use my credit card, which delayed my payment, which delayed my account status, extending the time of my bank receiving and clearing my payment on time!This delay caused hardship due to 4 additional days before I was allowed to apply for a new loan! Paying by credit card is a more efficient way for a customer to make payments online and on time without delays!

Bad place to get a loan,Bad place to get a loan. I took a loan out cause I needed to pay something Monday. I got approved rather quickly and easily but then I went to pick up my loan and they had no money.

I was told I had to cancel my current loan so I could reapply and be able to do online deposit. Problem was that now the money was going to be available Tuesday instead of Monday when I needed it. If taking out a loan as an emergency please do not consider Advance America. They are slow at giving you your money.,1

255 if I drive 200 miles a measley 132‚Ä¶,I had an bad experience someone was acting like they worked for the company sent me an approval letter telling me I was approved for a loan but then asks for too much information as far as my bank login information which I find very weird because that has never been asked before normally they would call my bank for verification but he wanted all of my information and he stated I would get funded $657 that I would have to go into a store active a prepaid debit card and make a payment to them then I would get my loan I said that‚Äôs weird to me because what company asks for money up front so than he does my bank verification but some how I found out he was disputing transactions on my account and making it seem like it was from their company but it was actually  my bank crediting my account for transactions he disputed. He was texting me which I thought was weird and kept blowing up my phone for me to send money back and he was trying to rush me so I knew it was a red flag and changed all of my information because I felt he was a scammer his name is Brandon Day please be aware and please be careful he threaten to have my account negative if I didn‚Äôt send the money that actually belongs to me to him and legal action against me which I am not worried about because he‚Äôs a fraud and scammer,1
No more,Larry & staff are always so Welcoming & great to work w/.,1
I had an bad experience someone was‚Ä¶,"I initially took out a payday loan with this company, which I successfully paid on time. Then the clerk had presented me with a line of credit, which she I could barely hear her, and she kind of sped through the loan. They do all agreements online, which I signed on this tiny device. I went online to check the account which I thought the interest rate was reasonable. I though this was cool and had planned on paying off the loan in two installments. I didn't realize they were charging me an exorbitant interest rate, and the loan amassed $375.45 in interest charges in the first month. Initially, only $25 was shown to have been applied to the principal. I missed the first payment, then I paid towards the second payment. They started generating random checks each month without my knowledge or permission, a few days prior to the due date to ensure that they receive their money on time. I had other bills that I needed to attend to, and their collection practices are predatory. I found out that the state I live in, they weren't supposed to have me as a customer. I'm in another state. I'm glad that I will no longer be using them as a lender, nor will I recommend them to anyone else. When they took my loan into default, I was under the impression that they were to negotiate with me on making a payment arrangement. The loan went into default after one month of being late. If I could give them zero stars, I would. According to the CFPB this type of behavior from a predatory lending institution is not uncommon. Once, I've made arrangements to take care of this bill, I will never do business with this company ever again.",1

Never got my loan now they saying I‚Ä¶,"THE WHOLE PROCESS WAS A NIGHTMARE.    First I went on line to get loan, then decided I would go pick it up myself. I was told that It would be ready to pick up in 3 business days. That was too long. I tried for some time to cancel the unfinished online loan process, but could not find a way to do it. Then I drove to Advance America on West El Camino, and was told they could not give me a payday loan because I already had a loan  ""IN PROCESS"" and I would have to drive home and finish it.    So I did, but was too upset to safely drive back to West El Camino, which is quite a distance away. So I went the next day and it was closed in the middle of the day. So then I drove back today and they said my loan went thru, but they didn't have any cash. . I asked it they could just deposit it in my bank account, but was told that he couldn't do that unless I  called the number he gave me and cancelled the loan. I tried to do that outside in the parking lot, but the Advance America lady on the line told me that "" YES, THEY COULD CANCEL THE LOAN IN PERSON AT EL CAMINO"", so I went back in. They couldn't, or maybe they just didn't know how.  So I ended up driving up and down Stockton Blvd for 45 minutes to find the other store in the heat. I had to call 3 times for direction, but at least they had the cash.    HOW IN THE H--- CAN A PAYDAY ADVANCE PLACE (West El Camino) RUN OUT OF CASH????? IT WAS STILL MORNING! And NO, they could not just transfer the loan to my bank. You folks must be really hard up for capable workers.This is way too much trouble to do business with Advance America. Poor management all around.",1

Horrible,"The loan came through.The only thing is that I was going to do a partial payment and at the end the took all the amount, i even spoke to an agent at a location and she said they weren't takin anything until I called and made a payment.That is really unprofessionaland that's why I'm giving you this review",1
Great customer service,"Advanced America dropped the ball this time. Am not for sure if this organization is truly committed to being a catalyst for assisting people with a real opportunity in having a ‚Äòpay day loan‚Äô or if it‚Äôs just a slogan used to market services, creating  any chance for inconveniences to customers and opportunities for stakeholders profits with underlying unethical intent!",1

Still waiting on money to hit my account,"I had a insulting experience in Texas, I was treated like a criminal. I have a Georgia driver license because I‚Äôve been staying with my daughter.I live in Lansing Michigan. I am visiting relatives in Houston and went to apply for loan and was denied.When I realized that it was not worth the hassle and ask agent to stop she insisted to call a supervisor and then she erase my file. I left upset and I am considering no longer having business with Advance America",2
only issue is your fees are to high.,Did not deposit the next day like they said on the site.,2
I love your service,I was disappointed after being approved for certain amount this gone week unfortunately to my surprise that amount of reduced to the lowest that I never thought on very disappointed up till now.,1
Doing a good job,I called but never talked to anyone and when I pressed 1 no one ever called be back so it is not a good look!!!,2
Totally Disappointed.,Everything was going great with the application until the last guy called me and said that he needed a signature from my CHIEF to complete the application! I wonder if everyone else that applies for a loan has there MAYOR or GOVERNOR sign for them. This is PREJUDICE!!,1
Poor service in customer care,The manager of the location has a very bad attitude! The day I walking in to get loan she was sitting outside on the phone and when I walked I said are you open and she said what you need?? I was like damn I don't want to go in there but I proceeded because I needed the cash until that Monday! I sent my husband in to pay the 500.00 back because via my contract it stated that I could pay back loan without the fee and she wanted to charge him the full 587.50 which my husband called me and told him that what my contract says and i told him to her to call somebody! The manager of this location is simply unprofessional and she is not empathic at all. I can honestly see why the location is closing because I promise you I am not the only feels this way!,2
Disappointed,"Pre-pandemic, I used a competitor when I ran into emergency issues. This year I found myself in need of a loan, and applied for a loan not with my former cash advance place, but with Advance America. I was shocked when they only offered me $400 for an installment loan (I make very good money, have a fair credit score, own my own house, etc...). But I needed it that day so I got it. I will be paying the balance off this Friday when I get paid in lieu of the installment process....and next time I'll not use Advance America. Heck, even a payday loan would have netted me $500.",1
Fast service,They didn‚Äôt ask my payday to take out loan payment,2
Saved my life,I never received my loan wich bank account did you send to,2
Not friendly didt care what happened‚Ä¶,"I am not happy with my recent experience. They have never sent my check to the bank. They know if I can't make it on my due date they know I will be in the next morning. Sometimes my doctor's appointments fall on my due date and I have to wait until the next morning to pay my check. They automatically know this. But since you made changes to how they are suppose to process checks it caused me a bunch of grief. It caused me several trips to my bank and gas that no one can hardly afford today. I am not pleased with your company at all. There are many check writing places in New Albany, Mississippi but people chose yours. But doing this type of stuff to people is a good way to run off business. Your company is the only one who has ever done this to me.",1
I thought i was given 2 weeks tonpay‚Ä¶,You guys are the greatest!  So patient and compassionate!   Thank you!,1

Advanced America dropped the ball this‚Ä¶,"Cashier was rude, also they did not have cash as I requested. The check I was given by the cashier said I could cash it at their bank, but  the bank would not cash as I was not a member. Just a hassle and not a great experience at all.",1

I had a insulting experience in Texas,Your manager has bad customer service she gives your customers bad attitude she is not nice to the customers you guys should give her training on better customer service,1
Did not deposit the next day like they‚Ä¶,"At the beginning of last month I took a loan out to help with my transplant related expenses.  While I was there a announcement was made that a  computer glitch happened and that only those paying back loans could take out loans.  People were disappointed but understanding.  When I paid my loan back I couldn't take out the usual amount because of the same glitch. I took what I could and left. The same or next day I got a email asking for my opinion on the experience.  I said the ladies were very nice and that they were very professional. I didn't have a bad thing to say about them. I did however tell them my disappointment with not being able to take out my full loan. The next day I recieved a call from whom I assumed was the manager of that location to discuss my review.  Instead of it being a wonderful conversation,  I spent the next several minutes justifying my review. I was told  that  I didn't tell everything and that I was given the option of coming back later when the system was back up.  My thoughts was what if it didn't come back up in time to pay my bills? I didn't understand why I was justifying my review about a computer issue that had nothing to do with the staff. Not once did I say anything negative in 3 years I've used this company.  She then proceeded to tell me the options given to me to compensate me for the inconvenience of not getting my full loan. I chose one and updated me review.  In my updated review I praised her and the company.  20 minutes after I hung up from her, I got another call from her stating that my information was outdated and i needed to bring in updated information.  I get SSDI  and always give the the paperwork once a year.  I took in my paycheck stubs just a few months ago so that I can get approved for a larger amount.  I'm  wondering why after 3 years of never ever receiving a call from this company, that I get two in one day. Why is it that my account is getting this much attention when all I did was give a review saying the computer system glitch made it impossible to get a full loan? No one should ever be treated this way because of a review that had nothing to do with any employee. No one should ever have to justify their opinion.  This by far is one of the worst experiences I've had with a company that I had a good relationship with.  As the day drew closer to pay my loan back, I had anxiety about having a confrontation with this lady or having the staff treat or look at me in a different fashion.  So I decided that I'll pay back my loan via over the phone and discontinue my relationship with this company.  The company gave  me some nice choices to choose from. Me passing up those options should speak volumes on how I felt after the experiences with this employee.  Let me say again,  this was a computer issue so why did she speak to me like I totally trashed her and the staff in my review. All this over a computer glitch.  I have done many reviews on many platforms.  My reviews have well over a million hits. I get that many hits because I don't need to lie or make up things. If I do make a mistake I own it. If this is the way you treat people who patronize your business,  then this is not the company I want to deal with. Its a shame because my fiance and I both just had transplants 6 months apart and we live 2 minutes away from this location.  I dont want anything else to do with this lady so please do not have her call me ever again. All of the staff I really like and its a shame I have to   end business dealings with them.",1
I was disappointed after being approved‚Ä¶,"Nothing special here, payday loan. I originally gave them 3 stars, but I received an email asking to adjust my score, so I did.",1

As a customer I have a right to make a decision on wearing face mask on my own, if the manager wants to wear one, fine. But to make a customer wear one when no law exists to require one, is unfair and wrong.",2

"Lies, Lies Lies!",I already have a payday loan with you'll in vicksburg Ms . I applied twice for an installment loan and was turned down .

They made me go to bank and get a print‚Ä¶,Very high interest rates and fees. Rates were substantially increased last year  Need more choice of loans specially with lower interest.

She said YES but gave me the customer service number to call in my payment.  Well today is MONDAY and no customer service rep can take my payment (not in system) and the local branch has no way to do it either (her systems are ONLY for lines of credit). I applied for the Line Of Credit which is $1000 BUT you can‚Äôt give me ANYTHING of that until my PayDay loan is paid.  I am going out of state on Wed and needed more funds before I left.

Your company sucks,Terrible! I have used Advance America for payday loans here and there. They have my history of when pay day is for me and still the mess up on the payment withdrawal from my bank. I get paid on the 30th and 15th. My last loan was withdrawn on 3/28. WTH!...this caused an overdraft in my account. I will have to tell people not to use them. I will postmy bad experience In all social media.,1
It's too expensive,Jeremy at the riverview office is extremely rude.  He argues with the customer and has to prove the customer is always wrong. I will not go to that particular store again. I will drive out of my way to avoid him.,2
I have dealt with advance America for‚Ä¶,I was 1 day late paying on a loan and was called and told that my check was process it bounced.

Then when I got off work I went straight to the bank withdrew the money and went straight to AA to pay the loan but asked the teller if my check was rejected they stated it never was processed. The worker named Amber lied to me twice first on the call then when I went into AA. Very disappointed I‚Äôve never had an issue before.,2

According to the manager the state of Missouri sets the interest rate. That's B's . It's all about the money for this company. Sure they help you with money you need fast but believe me it's not worth it. I got an email saying I can refinance it. What a joke. That's so my payments start all over and are higher. Not happening. People really do research before you take out a loan with them,1
Your on line app is faulty,"They don‚Äôt even have cash in the stores! I got my loan approved online for cash pick up. The 2 stores in st. Joe didn‚Äôt even have cash. It‚Äôs absurd they have a ‚Äúget cash at store option‚Äù and then have no cash. I was mad and embarrassed for them, had to go to Leavenworth for cash.

You screwed me,"My brother passed away and had a title loan with this company.  I tried to call to just get a phone number for assistance and Tish was so unprofessional and had to make snide comments under her breath.  I have NEVER been treated so poorly on the phone.  She actually hung up on me.  Tish is at the Fairlawn office, so I called Arlington Rd and they were SUPER helpful.  I will be writing to Corporate about Tish and her attitude.",1
Online system  doesn't work worth the‚Ä¶,I have been using advance America for over a year and the new employee at my branch is very rude and disrespectful. I honestly probably will not renew another loan after mines paid just because of her.,1
My loan was due in under 2 weeks,You people suck. I spoke w/ 3 different people w/ my actual due date. My Social Security ck comes on the 4th Wed of every month. When I went to the Clairemont Mesa store Bea held my debit if it was over 30 days. I explained that to Kim since you debited my acct early. She indicated she'd reset the due date accordingly but she promised I would NOT be debited again. Then I spoke w/ Oscar about the problem & he assured me you would not be debited again till my correct date Feb 23. Then I spoke w/ a 3rd person who forwarded to another dept where I stayed in hold for app 1 hr. You people are a joke. I had to renew my current loan but once that's due in 3/23 you will NEVER see me again. For your measly $255 loan I do NOT need this aggravation.I do hope you post this review so other people can beware of your unprofessional company.,1

I could get to the point where my password was accepted, and it said, ""Welcome, Leslie, blah, blah, blah,"" then gave instructions to enter the verification code you would be sending. I received verification codes via text and email, and each time I entered them and clicked Verify, the yellow ""Verify"" box turned pale and no further action would occur. I understand that multistep authentication is being implemented to improve security, but perhaps you shouldn't roll it out until you've worked out all the bugs. This experience was a nightmare.",1

Stupid high interest,"I was in Winnsboro, SC and found a Advance America location and decided to go in to get an advance. Since it was closer to me at the time. I was expecting the same customer service that I get from the Two Notch Road location. To my surprise, it was not at all what I am use to. To say the least the representative acted as if she didn't want to wait on me. The store had a be back at 3:00pm sign on the door and I arrived at 3:10pm the representative told. E she was still on break but would assist me. I should have left at that point, but gave it a try. The representative made it a point to me that all their customers get checks we don't keep cash. Not friendly at all. I should have known because it has been my experience that mostly all the people in the Winnsboro area are rude and unprofessional. I will Not go back to that location again. The two at the Two Notch Road location are very friendly from the time they unlock the door until they finish your transaction. Winnsboro has a bad representation for visitors and customer service. I thought the Advance America in the area would be different but not. They didn't even provide or offer water or snacks.",1
TISH needs training in Customer Service,Approved me for a loan the same cost as my payout for previous loan making a new loan necessary and pointless,1
I have been using advance America for‚Ä¶,I have used these services for several years. The last few months have been the most disheartening and disrespecting. The Center I used was shut down without any warning. It allowed me to pay in the office but told me I would have to go to another office to reborrow.. This recent transactionI called and explained I had tested positive for COVID19 and if it was possible to complete the transaction over the phone including reborrow of the funds. I was told that I could. After the money was paid. I asked what did I need to do to reborrow. I was told i/could not be done. I explained that I was told I could. They explained that it could not be done. I said excuse me I asked you that before the transaction and you said I could.  They told me sorry for inconvenience let me transfer to customer support. I explained what happened and they said we don't do that. But I was told that initially and would have tried to make other arrangements.  I was told to go online and apply. Going online takes away from me being able to pay my bills as I have in the past. I feel thatI was misinformed and taken advantage of due to being in a situation beyond my control with COVID19.  As I stated I have used these services for several years even paid it out and in the process of doing it again. I explained before paying  I needed to pay AND reborrow. I was told ok. Then after paying told I could not. That's false information and I don't want to have the funds taken from my account. I would rather do as I have been down. I pay on time.,2

I was thankful it wasn't much that I owed my bank, but the point is , very bad experience, money was tight already!",1

They told me if I would have paid with my debit card prior to them taking the payment automatically then I could have renewed in 24hrs. Again, no mention of that either.  I asked if I can show them my bank statement showing that the payment cleared, they said I could but I would still have to wait 3 business days. Not very willing to assist.

Terrible,"I applied Thursday early afternoon. No one reached out or asked for anything. Come the next day, I reached out and asked if there was anything else I needed to do (again, had not and still haven‚Äôt received what was needed). I was informed an ID was needed. So I put that in. Later that day around 4:45 - 5 - I logged back in and it said it was approved! Awesome! It may take a little time. Then it tells me it won‚Äôt be available until the next business day (and weekends aren‚Äôt business days). After that, the site updates to tell me due to Mondays holiday, they won‚Äôt come through that day either. So now I will (maybe) be receiving the money into my account literally three days before I‚Äôm supposed to pay it back. How is that ok? Why was I not informed BEFORE hand? The site said nothing about that until after 5 on Friday. I can‚Äôt talk to anyone about it because you guys were closed all weekend apparently. I‚Äôd already  applied and was approved so I couldn‚Äôt go somewhere else, which forced me to have to wait, in silence, to hopefully be able to call on the 18th and explain the situation. I‚Äôll be honest, I was super relieved at first when it went through, then I found out all the other information and it instantly made me feel far worse. My opportunities were taken and I feel like the company took complete advantage of me in my time of need. I‚Äôm seriously upset about this. I didn‚Äôt need the money on Tuesday, on Monday, noR Sunday. I needed it Thursday or Friday, Saturday at the latest. Not a whole week later. At this point, it‚Äôs going to cost me even more money to borrow this money, AND I still got hit with late fees. Literally, this whole process and the lack of transparency has cost me about $150 in fees, not including the fee for this. I‚Äôm in a worse spot than I was. I really do feel like this was done predatorily. I‚Äôm not the only one who experienced this, and it makes me think it was done purposefully. The lack of communication, the fact I had to reach out to find out what else was needed, the fact the site said nothing about the 17th until after the fact, etc. I‚Äôm not trying to be rude, but this has caused a lot of problems when it should have been helping to solve them.",1

Unfortunately, he did not manually change the date and the loan went through a day before my payday causing my account to go negative. I was told there was nothing that could be done but I could purchase another loan the next day to help.

Upon arrival at the bank the ink was so smeared and illegible that the bank would not accept the check.  Upon return to the store I was told there was nothing that could be done until Monday.  On Monday I was informed that we had to wait 24 hours for the cancelation on the check. Staff should have informed me the location was closing before processing any loan information/paperwork to ensure I wanted to proceed.  The check printed and issued to me should not have and issue with smearing or rubbing off, like it did.  I should not have to had to wait 4 days to ensure the transaction had been cancelled and all business issues resolved.

After paying over $1100 for gift cards to obtain my loan, I gave up because they still wanted me to spend more money out of my pocket before I could receive my loan proceeds. Living on Social Security I really couldn't afford to lose this kind of money. Once I gave up they told me I wouldn't be reimbursed for my expenses of $1100 because I didn't receive the loan. I should mention that one of the reasons I had to purchase so many cards was after purchasing and sending the cards through both email or text message I was told the card was invalid. I checked the value of the last card I sent and 2 hours after Advance America confirmed they received the card, there were 3 transactions made (for $99.98 each) for one specific merchant. The card then had a value of $.06. Out of 6 cards I purchased either online or in store, only 2 of them were good according to Advance America.

The lady at 63rd street next to price‚Ä¶,"They do what they say - they loan you the money for a ""Payday Loan"" and deposit it into your bank account by the following business day, BUT, they also take the money you owe them out of your bank account THE DAY BEFORE YOUR PAYCHECK IS DEPOSITED INTO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT...  Hence the term ""PAYDAY LOAN"", which means a loan until your next payday or pay date. The result of Advance America taking the money I owed them out of my bank account the day before my payday caused my bank account to be OVERDRAWN. I would give a ""ZERO-0"" Star Rating if Trustpilot gave that option.",1

I got the loan and I asked how quick I‚Ä¶,"Only reason for the 1 star is there isn‚Äôt enough staff on Fridays. The last month I have come Friday and there has been a closed signed. I know this is due to training a new customer service person and having to take lunch at the same time as the trainer. This last Friday she was there by herself and again closed when I went. The customer service what‚Äôs always been friendly but not having specified times to be closed to lunch is very frustrating. I shouldn‚Äôt have to make multiple trips because the times that it‚Äôs closed is never consistent. The poor girl there last Friday 11/12 couldn‚Äôt even go to the bathroom because there were people in the lobby, that is horrible for her to endure.

The loan came out of my account on November 4th and made my account negative! After a full day on the phone with them again they said they couldn't reopen the loan and there was nothing else they could do. After years of being a loyal customer they royally screwed me in the end. I will no longer do business with this company and will tell others not to either. Thanks a lot for not correcting YOUR COMPANY'S ERROR!! I'm still trying to get my account out of the hole!,1

My biggest reason why I gave it low stars is because when he called his colleague, they shared all my info by phone (by this time there was a customer in the lobby) .

The Best ladies of the south.,"This company is not what they say they are. They are pushing trying to get people to buy bitcoin. They take all your personal information, and then they are wanting you to send them money back by either going to some store or through bitcoin. They do not work with you on this, they will not use any of the other sending money options that are well known and trusted, not even to gain a customer. One of the questions in the beginning of the process was if I use bitcoin. I said no, and asked why they ask that, and they would not respond to that. Then later I asked if they are a company that sells bitcoin, they stated no, but would not work with me any other way. Complete waste of time, and not good customer service at all. I spoke with Jason Green, Sr. Loan Analyst who just kept saying ok, ok, ok, ok.... I would not recommend this company to a person even if they were a last resort. They are not what they say they are and at the very least, they for sure have horrible customer service and are not willing to do anything more convenient for the sake of gaining a customer.",2
I applied for a payday loan and for two‚Ä¶,Awful I needed the money on Saturday I didn't get it until Tuesday.  I don't need it now.  A waste of time that now is actually costing me money.,1
The worst customer service ever,I recently took out a cash loan for 300 dollars for emergency medical care.  It ended up being more than expected and I called the same store to see if I could borrow a little more. The guy got smart with me and actually started laughing at me because I didn't know I would have to pay back the 300 first. That was not explained to me. Will never use them again,1
I have been trying to contact someone‚Ä¶,I applied and requested an in store pick up - 1 arrived at 1130 after driving an hour and a half to the closest store and was told they didn‚Äôt have any money to fund my loan - no options were provided- I returned the next day and was told the same thing- I called customer service and was told they would provide a debit card or check - this process required 3 trips to complete and cost me $ 40 I‚Äôm gas and 4 hours of driving- the dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever heard was a loan Buisness that doesn‚Äôt have money,1
You were suppose to deposit the money‚Ä¶,Terrible place. Do yourself a favor and give any other loan place a shot. I settled my account with them in June. I tried to apply for one today in October and they tell me that I have a unsettled account. Waste of time and gas. Mind you it wouldn‚Äôt allow me to apply on line. I called them to verify that my account was in good standing they suggested that I go to the store and my account was fine. Just for them to say my account is unsettled but they see I paid it off months ago so to try again in a few days. Unorganized and unprofessional.,2
Gift Card Scam with no loan,"I understand many places are short staffed right now, however in a customer service business leaving a customer holding on the line for almost 2 solid hours(i just sat my phone beside me on speaker) well that is ridiculous.

Never got thru to chat not phone services. I just sent in what was requested before it was requested and the loan has already been approved but was somehow ""pending"" after approval? Eventually it was approved, which i did for in store pick up because i needed it that day, only to be approved 4 minutes after the store closed. I was almost 4 hours in total trying to get it taken care of. This was not my first loan so I'm not sure what the issues actually ever were.",1

Good Customer Service!!!,My husband had made a loan through Advance America online. There was notes made at the store that it was not supposed to be taken out on the 8th which it said online instead the store put it for the 13th when my husband got paid. They had pulled the main girl from that store to another store for just a few days and the person that was there went ahead and sent it through our bank on the 8th instead of doing her job and reading the notes that was left for her. Now they say it takes 5 to 7 days great to get back to them and them reimburse us what's in the meantime I'm overdrawn because of it and I cannot use my debit card until Advance America gets this back to me.

There was a problem and your system said I still had an open loan but SoM said they were all closed with the new online loan open. The store manager Lisa was on hold for 40 minutes with customer service trying to get this resolved. She never got through. Driving back to Michigan was a huge waste of a day.

Never do an online loan through Advance America,I have put out many complaints about the Alexander city branch yet I still find that the head manager there is still working.

The woman  that did my loan had attitude,"Yes, there‚Äôs been a couple of mistakes and problems that we‚Äôre not exactly handled the best. The first problem was I called the customer assistance number to get onto a government payment plan for my online loan. After being on hold for 51 MINUTES  I was finally disconnected. And this is since I gave up and just really long which cost me a extra $30-$40. Next, was a mistake made by a customer assistance operator. I called in to once again get on a payment plan (I couldn‚Äôt make it to the store) this time for my in-store loan.  I had just taken out an online loan about 2 to 3 hours earlier. I talk to the customer care assistant and they said they could put it on a payment plan no problem. Come to find out they put the loan I just taken out three hours ago on a payment plan and my other loan was still due. So fast forward two weeks later and I‚Äôm in the store to pay back and re-loan and I‚Äôm told that I‚Äôm not eligible. I called customer care and was told I had to clear it up with a agency in Michigan. I called the agency up and they said they have no way of taking me off a payment plan and I need to call back to advance America. I was able to get on with a different customer care specialist and they were able to solve the problem. Unfortunately, this took me over an hour to get cleared up. So you might ask why after all these problems didn‚Äôt i file complaint before. I understand in these times businesses are having trouble running as efficiently as they would like. But you did send me an email asking for my feedback, so I‚Äôm providing it. I hope that not only for your business but for all the other businesses that are struggling things get better.",2
Associate very RUDE,I wanted to cancel my loan before it funded.  First I tried holding for over an hour and no one ever answers.  Then I tried requesting the call back.  No one ever calls you back.  Then I tried chatting.  No representative was available.  Then I tried emailing.  No one has answered me yet.  I logged in after the funding came through hoping to pay off the loan.  Guess what?  No option to make payments online.  All around awful AWFUL non-existent customer service.,1
Excellent service,I've done business with the office on Rainbow for years. I've never late with a payment. Because I questioned getting a courtesy call my customer experience was the worst I have EVER had. Once this loan is paid I will have to find another service to use.,2

Your employee sent us to both banks and then told us we would have to go to Walmart or Dodge‚Äôs where they cash checks to get them cashed.  We even asked her if she could give us cash the next day and she said probably not.  We needed this money and we are on a limited budget and cannot afford to be paying out extra money to cash these checks.  We are great customers but may not be using you again.",1

Didn't help me out at all wasted time‚Ä¶,"Ive given 5 star reviews before to advance America, but this time I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be going back. I used the new online option to request a payday loan. All went well, all information verified, and all contracts signed money is ready for pick up within the hour! Great! No. I get to the store, go up, tell her I did the online loan and got an email to come pick up the cash or check. The lady looks at me and says ‚Äúwhat, what online thing? I‚Äôve never heard of this, oh great just what I wanted to do on a Friday morning. Hold on let me call my boss because I don‚Äôt know how to do this stuff. Give me your I‚Äôd‚Äù I give her my ID and copy of the email and loan number from online. After waiting about 10 minutes she says she finds it. Hangs up with her boss, and then says she doesn‚Äôt have an option to give cash. So I say ok, a check is fine like I do every other time. She says well then I need your bank information. I said uh ok.. it‚Äôs in system? I come here a lot, and I verified it online last night with the loan app. She says ‚Äúwell I still need verification‚Äù so I give her my account and routing number. ‚ÄúWell it says it doesn‚Äôt work, and it‚Äôs not letting me click on verify‚Äù. This is now going on being in the store for 35 minutes.  She then tells me that she‚Äôs going to have to cancel and do everything over again manually so I need to print out all my documents I had submitted online and bring them to the store. I said forget it. I had to get going, and tried using the online tool because of ‚Äúhow much faster and convenient‚Äù it was to do online. She says, ‚Äú well why‚Äôd I just waste all that time trying to get it to work!‚Äù I just smiled and politely said so much for that being a faster process. And walked out. The online tool says that if you do not pick up your money by closing time 2 days after you sign the documents then your loan will be cancelled. Well 3 days later I get an email reminding me of my payback date for the money I never received! Now, no one can explain to me what happened and I still show an open account. The only reason I gave two stars instead of 1 is because I like the idea of Advance America in general and had never had a bad experience until now. But it made enough of an impact for me to not want to go back.",1

As if  you do not charge enough‚Ä¶,Print the first review that should give you a to you again the people at the site were awesome but because I wouldn't take four little dollars in cash in the rest on the card and time was limited went to an ATM nearby it wouldn't let me do it because it was a crap ATM and I knew I was going to make it to my bank y'all need to get a better way but because of what y'all done to me well I'm never going back to y'all and now I'll probably going to jail but I'm not going to let that happen so I'm probably going to have to buy the farm and I guess I'm going to have to do that myself kick the old bucket because I'm tired of starting over because of companies like you and PayPal when I never had to come to you guys are PayPal I want to kelp my paycheck and put me in a 45 dispute so I gave me y'all to catch up and now I'm even more behind because of four little dollars in cash did you want to take so I will not go to jail never been never will go so I rather kick the bucket but you'll get your money the people are great though the corporate sucks me buying the farm stays on your mind forever that you ended something that I was trying to build and made me completely give up for four little dollars you couldn't take in hand hey maybe my family take action on this towards you since I'm not going to be able to,2
I have put out many complaints about‚Ä¶,"This was the baddest I've ever dealt with, please don't send anything to my house again.... thanks for nothing",1
You're doing great.,"Awful website.  I have been trying for two months to log online and all I get is a constant loading sign.  I reported this concern several times but to no avail.  Now, I have to go into the store and apply for the loan.",2
I never got the money,"Everything went very smoothly,  but stupid me, didn‚Äôt read entire thing, I didn‚Äôt realize the entire 300 would b due on sept 3, I really need to make payment, just like the rest of the world I‚Äôve been struggling trying to keep my head above water,,  can someone pls let me know if it‚Äôs possible to make payments on this loan ty Susan",1
Did not work to get more time to pay‚Ä¶,It is so easy to take care of business.  I love it,1
Bad business,inflation interest rate are to high for a small loan think about it.,1
Never return or answer call,They told me that I was approved then said I wasn‚Äôt,1
I kept trying to call the customer‚Ä¶,I haven‚Äôt received my loan I got an email saying I was approved but hasn‚Äôt been deposited to my account‚Ä¶‚Ä¶,1
I would say that your service at this‚Ä¶,They lied about payment after I was told a different pay time period she told me I would pay every 28days then turned around and said every 2weeks after the check was cashed on Frankford 2 females a white and black one then said they just started working there,1
I tried to call corporate I have‚Ä¶,"I recently went in to get a loan. I‚Äôd recently borrowed and had old documentation uploaded to my account. I Thought that some might be out of date so I uploaded new pay records to my profile online. I went in to the store and the rep told me that she needed new documentation and I advised that I uploaded new paperwork. She told me that the ‚Äúonline department‚Äù is totally different from in store and they do not have access to see what is online and vice versa. This caused her to have to fill out a hand written form and me to have to pull up all of the information on my phone while in store. The hand written form was then uploaded online. Just not sure why the option is there to help with convenience, but then not recognized in store. Especially with COVID, passing my phone back and forth was not an ideal situation.",1
Honest opinion,Unhelpful and quite frankly disappointing,2
"I received a late notice ,paid 9/3",I've been using my local store for years and never had a problem until now. My payday advance was processed using my bank debit card to deposit funds in my bank account. I went out to my car and while still in their parking lot tried to make an online debit card purchase but funds were not yet available. No problem I went to bank to pull funds from ATM. The next day I saw bank charged NSF fee. Funds from Advance America were never deposited. I called the local store 2x's but reached corporate without reporting. Later that day I talked to local store was asked to come in. The lady that processed my advance wasn't there. I was told my transaction was processed as cash and given the transaction amount in cash. I said my debit card was swiped for the transaction and I need the $35 NSF fee refunded. She reiterated it was processed as cash and no refund made. I didn't get an apology either. I'm on SS and I need the $35 refunded AND AN APOLOGY.,2
I wanted to cancel my loan before it‚Ä¶,10 yrs of on time payments and new management thinks taking two extra days to get monies by seizing it from bank one day early are somehow beneficial to company ! Promise it are not and will be proven to be incorrect time after time !,1
Time to move on,"The location I used ran out of cash, that's absolutely unacceptable! I had the choice of using a check to cash at my bank the next day, or getting a damn Netspend card. I had no choice but to get the debit card and I did not get to use the full $445 because of their fricking fees! This was wrong Advance America! You owe some type of refund on the fees I had to pay to use the dsmn debit card!",1
It was so easy to make a payment but‚Ä¶,"I was promised a call back from a supervisor, have not recieved any call. I have tried to call, or start another chat but the wait time gets longer  and longer while I'm in que. If I press 2 to call me back, no phone call. I feel like you think I will go away. Hopefully on Monday I can take this higher up. I need answers!",2
No money,"The communication process isn't always clear. Some things were sent in the mail about payments but not my email and vice versa. Waiting period to hear back from an employee was longer than expected. Sometimes phone calls were received but the caller id didn't show and no voicemails were made, but if its policy to not leave a voicemail is understandable.",1
Slow on responding,This company doesn‚Äôt care about the customer. I had a loan due August 4th. I paid it off June 30th. Renewed my loan and I got confirmation that it was accepted and my loan was due to be paid on 8/15/21. August 4th they deduct my account. I‚Äôm overdrawn because of there mistake and they won‚Äôt help. Th excuse is the system I set up that way but if we were late the system would work fine. This company is horrible and I won‚Äôt recommend it to anyone. Then I get a response that someone will contact me back and no call. Just like I said a horrible company. Do not use this lender.,1
I called Customer Service over an hour‚Ä¶,"Taking money out of my account without even calling me first is not very professional. My entire paycheck was taken from me the day I got it, WITHOUT contacting me.",1
The people are rude and customer‚Ä¶,"I came in for a Title Loan and because the lady didn't know how to do her job, I left with a Payday Loan! As we were doing my title loan, an older lady came in to pay on her loan and your employee put the payment on my paid off loan from 2020. So the customer had to come back when she realized the receipt was not in her name. So your employee had to do a hand written receipt for her & then couldn't figure out how to take that payment off my paid account so after 2 hours I had to leave with a Payday Loan!! This lady was very unprofessional and basically said there was nothing she could do until the computer fixed her mistake!!",1
Ive given 5 star reviews before to‚Ä¶,u send me a email on aloan go to store say iowa people cant ? i emailed in and havent heard a word back ? what u dont care of ur iowa customers ?,2
Requested the money on Fri- needed no‚Ä¶,"On July 28, 2021 I went to advance America to get $250 loan. After the lady did my application she opened her drawer to get my money and said that she was short of cash but she could do a deposit directly to my account. I said no I need the money right now I think the bank will hold The check for 10 days before depositing it.  The lady said no it‚Äôs a direct posit it will be there in five minutes. I said ok but it Hass to go in in five minutes because I have to have the money today. When I went to the bank there had been no deposit I went the second time to the bank there was still no deposit I went back to Advance America and the lady told me that yes it has been deposited I told her I had just come from the bank and there was no money in my account. She told me she couldn‚Äôt help me I ask for a phone number for someone that could help me she told me she could not give me that phone number because it was a cell phone. It‚Äôs now August 2 and there are still no deposit in my account. I think this is so wrong and I think it should be illegal for your employee to tell me it would be there in five minutes and when it did not go she still couldn‚Äôt help me. I have done business here before but this is been the biggest nightmare ever!! It just shows me that advance America does not care anything about a client.  I think this direct deposit is fraud and now I‚Äôm in a worse shape than I was in when I went to get the check advance in the beginning. Word of mouth is the best advertisement but it‚Äôs also the worst advertisement for a business! I will never ever go back to advance America and anybody that asked me I will tell them the same thing.",1
Your interest rate is ridiculous and‚Ä¶,Your refer a friend program is a joke. Some sort of scam. When the store manager put my info in my phone for me twice and now she says it's to late. I was looking at my loan documents online and my info is different than the store. Store manager says it a programming problem. Not sure how to resolve it.I'm paying my loans off this month and I will not be back or any of my friends.Carl Sink,1
Very good service always helpful,"A week ago , I email you and asked you to block me from your system that I have a gambling problem . It seems to me you don't care as long as you keep making $ 45.00 almost every week.  You even made it easier for me to obtain a loan even during non bussiness hrs. I have currently 4 payday loans pending and I am going to need more time to repay this loan. I know that ultimately it is my responsability and I will pay you. But if I asked you for help, why did you ignore it ? Once I am in a casino I have no control and I will do whatever it takes to get money. I ask for the second time , d I not lend me money anymore. I am getting help for my problem , please do not contribute to my problem. If speedy cash did it so can you. Thabk you.",2
not enough cash,"I have had great response and respect for your company before.I have had several loans and had paid back no problem.after I moved from Wyoming to Dallas i needed a loan again after severalyears I up dated information as requested and after talking with the rep they said yes you have done everything needed so I applied for the loan again and i asked whets the loan amount i can expect to get she told me $1,800.ok great thank you update my information. only to find out i can only get $700.00the next day MORE INFORMATION NEEDED, I again spoke with someone and told me i was good  okay so I fill out that.next day MORE INFORMATION NEEDED.so iI complete all of that and was supposed to be good to go.then the day i was supposed to get the loan computers go down and I can't get the loan until Wednesday ! well my bank was supposed to get the funds I needed to avoid some service charges and bam i get those services charges hit me at the tune of $240.00 well the 700.00 dollar loan was gone in a flash due to fees and didn't cover what It was  supposed to.my fault for not attending to my own checking account but i wasn't expecting a hit from a company that took money from my account, thus the reason I needed your services.  your company should have been more informative and honest about what was needed in the beginning and  should have been more attentive to the paper work needed in the beginning. not happy with the end result at all but this will probably fall on deaf ears anyway.i do appreciate the loan but not the run around and Inefficiencies that the way this was handled.",2
I left a loan Application couple days‚Ä¶,I received my fist payment on the 26th of the month and i requested a monthly installment plan for the loan. But your excepting the payment back in 7day on the 3rd of the following. When I CALLED to extend the due date the wait time hold was 30 minutes and you had no resolution to extend the day i was told to go delinquent instead.,1
After presenting my paycheck of net‚Ä¶,"Getting the money is fast and easy.  However, Advance America knows that I get paid every other Friday.  Last loan they took the money the day before payday and the next loan they are taking a day early too.  I have tried to call and chat with them for days and cannot get through, one time was on the recording for over an hour.",2
Advance America withdrew $575.00 from my bank account for a loan I did not ask for. I started an application but never finished it because I thought better of it. I'm having a hard time reaching AA,Everything started out great after I have done business with this company 3 times for a payday loan. I applied recently several times and kept getting denied even after my payments were made in full and on time. I don't know what the issue was or is but I will never business with them again.,1
Love the ease of use,When their system messes up your payment it is considered your fault. Customer service through the phone is useless and extremely unprofessional. I have never had a issue with my card working and I‚Äôve been pushed through to multiple people running my account and then was told I did it too many times and their system has a error but I‚Äôd have to ‚Äúfigure it out‚Äù. This is a joke. I have used them for 2 and a half years and have never been treated as poorly as today. Horrible.,2
no coordination between store and‚Ä¶,Tried getting help by talking to a customer representative and one hour waiting no one still answered. Very bad service.,1
I go to advance America for payday‚Ä¶,Everytime I use the online services for a payday loan the system enters the pay date the day before my payday and the customer service line closes before I get off work. This time due to long wait times I was unable to reach someone and I know am going to be charged a $30 overdraft fee by my bank. I'm not using advance america again.,2
The people at the store are extremely‚Ä¶,"Every time I try to use the online loan process, I have to wait for 2 days, and then I have to cancel the loan and go into the store. The nearest store is 30 miles away so this is a major inconvenience. I even input my debit card for a quicker deposit turnaround. However, when you are taking payment from me, it comes out of my account immediately. Debra, in the Shelbyville Indiana office, is the nicest person you have working for your company. She is the only one who ever goes out of her way to help the customer.",1
I am stuck in your never ending circle‚Ä¶,THE FIRST TIME I EVER GOT A LOAN I CAME IN WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE. THE 2ND VISIT WAS HORRIBLE UNPROFESSIONAL AND THE LADY THAT ASSISTED ME I CANT EVEN SAY HELP WAS VERY UNSURE OF WHAT SHE WAS DOING AND I DEFINITELY WAS TOLD INFORMATION TOY DIFFEREBT FRON THE FIRST LADY. I REALLY JUST WANTED TO LEAVE HOWEVER I GOT ANOTHER LOAN I WILL PAY IT FRIDAY BUT I WONT VISIT THIS LOCATION AGAIN. HOWEVER THE VERY FIRST TIME I LEFT I THINK HER NAME WAS TASGA A EXCELLENT REVIEW.

I usually would give 5 star's but my‚Ä¶,One of the female receptionist in the 500 Mark branch location seemed BIAS- I asked if she had a fax number she replied NO. But of course we know that not true. I notice she was warm to other customers. I just didn‚Äôt appreciate her energy. Please Fix It!,1
Very rude discriminating,They're getting people hit with  false  charges. An my husband is being  framed!!!,1
Staff were very professional and‚Ä¶,Can never get anyone on the phone. Always put on hold for at least 2nd and disconnected,2
So I go into the warrens burg store to‚Ä¶,I enjoy advance America but recently you have moved employees around and some that has been at the blanding Blvd store aren't very nice on the 14th I went to that store i was there at 10:00 am the woman came went inside turned off the alarm i assume then she came back outside got in her car started smoking and on the phone I waited about 10 minutes and decided to go see if it was open the she told me it wasn't going to open until later on so I left and came back in 1 hour and it was finally open I don't want to keep going on there was a couple more times me and my wife had problems at that store I'm  sorry but someone should be checking on these employees . The man that was working there was the best.,2
I was sent a response to my loan‚Ä¶,The last two months I have done my loan or tried to do in my loan as far as renewing it on the app website and both months I have had pure HELL I am not happy I am very dissatisfied has nothing to do with the storm deridder because they have been as helpful as they can be it has to do with how you‚Äôre running things I don‚Äôt like the new system and I‚Äôm very disappointed,1
Took and a very long time to get‚Ä¶,The computers were down for a long time and 4 or 5 of us had to wait for almost a hour before getting service.  The two ladied behind the counter seamed to not know how to handle transactions.,2
When I went to website to do the‚Ä¶,The clerk that I applied the  loan with which was also the manager not only was she rude and disrespect full but she also falsified information she entered in order for me not to recieve a loan I didn't know she had authority to how much amount I could receive. And had the power to enter information regarding my loan altered to the way she wanted this is the worst place to get a loan I am attempting to contact a attorney as we speak because I know what she did was completely illegal,1
Print the first review that should give‚Ä¶,"Would literally never loan here again if I had to. I‚Äôve been a customer for several years, and I‚Äôve only had a few minor hiccups before, the last time I loaned was an absolute nightmare. They ACH my payment and it took over a week for my loan to clear, even though the money came out of my bank account immediately, I could not re-loan. All of my money was then tied up. The absolute worst customer service when I called to try and fix it.",1
This was the baddest I've ever dealt‚Ä¶,$300 is not enough money at 34% and is not worth my time.  I would definitely not recommend borrowing such a small amount only to end up paying back twice the amount that you borrowed.  Save up an emergency fund and make a budget.  Peace.,1
Awful website that won‚Äôt allow you to log on.,You guys perform well during customer service,1
Everything went very smoothly,Very poor online and in store service.   Also I don't have time to sit on hold for another 2hrs last time I called the 1800 number.. I'll tell the storey here..I applied for a at 4am didn't hear anything by 8am so I sent few emails to customer service asking how I would know if I needed to do anything else so it would be processed same day to my bank. So after numerous emails and live chat no response til after the cut off for same day processing. They informed me that only was to get it same day was in-store so I canceled my online application and when to store (20 miles away) Upon arrival 2 employees was standing by door smoking no biggie. I explain to ladies assisting me as soon as they greeted me that i just canceled my online loan because i couldn't get money same day and neither one said a word...so i do my application everything goes fine until they ask how I want my money lol I'm like cash haha they are like sorry we only have $20 in our drawer but we can give you a prepaid card haha so needless to say I canceled that loan also üòÖ,2
It is so easy to take care of business,Customer service could have been a little more professional. If I didn't really need the cash I probably would have left.,1

Unhelpful and quite frankly‚Ä¶,"on July 3rd I came in for a loan. She set it up and  at the end I asked what dayit was to be payed on. she said 29th of each month. I am on a fixed income and I came in on the 3rd to make sure it would be taken out on this day. After all paperwork was done then she told me it would be taken out then.. You can bet I will not being doing loans with you again. I was told if I had a problem with it take it up with office and she then gave me a number and toke it up with them. If it is taken out of my account before 3rd it will cost me $45, over draft fee. Thank you.",1

I ended up calling them to see what was wrong and the woman was very nice, however, told me that I not only had to send in my bank statement and ID photo but also photos of the back of the ID plus a photo of me holding the ID.   These steps were not listed in the instructions and I didn't find out about them until I called.   I went to the store itself and got the loan within minutes instead of waiting for a week.   I will only go to the store and never online again.    I gave one star for this website but 5+ for the lady at the store.",1

Taking money without permission.,"I have been utilizing the Advance America for the last couple of years.  I have seen some serious changes that are affecting customer service.  The first being that this facility has a problem having money to give to their customers.   They either refer them to another Advance America, or say that they can deposit to their debit card.  The second item is that my debit card is PNC that is utilized for my UMB account through Fidelity investments.  I had no problem paying my payments with my debit card through the !-800 number.  Now  Advance America can not take my payments from me using this PNC debit card.  I have to travel there to make my payments, where as before I called the 1-800 number and made the payment.  Also Advance America can not even deposit funds onto my PNC card.  Becoming a major inconvenience.  Third, I had to delay my payments because of a medical situation.  I called the corporate office and they extended my payment date.  However the branch processed my payment on the initial date, which caused a serious issue with me because I was unable to obtain heart medication because of the action of the branch.  When I questioned about it they said the corporate office could not do the extension only the branch.  When I contacted the corporate office they refuted that and said they have authorization to do such an extension of a payment date.  It seams like the branch and the corporate office are not on the same page.  I did this once before about a year ago and had no issues have it was authorized by the corporate office.   Something has changed and it is not in the best interest of the customer.  Lastly, I am unable to get a loan online, because I am unable to have the deposits made into my bank, do to Advance America not allowing a PNC debit card to be utilized.",2
I came in for a Title Loan and left with a Payday Loan!,When u get a loan it's to much interest that's my opinion,2
u send me a email on aloan go to store‚Ä¶,"I came to this location to pay my loan and was very disappointed with the service. Ive been going to this location for years and never experienced this type of service. The lady helping me actually stole $100 from me and did it while the cameras were on. She claimed I only gave her $200 which was false because all I had was $300 in my wallet. She pulled this, you only gave me $200 when I clearly gave her $300. She acted as if something fell over her counter which was the $100 she said I was short. This happened this past 25th of June around 11 am or so with only 1 employee working at the time. Worst experience I‚Äôve ever had at this location.",1

Your refer a friend program is a joke,I have into your store's for a payday loan no issues very professional. This last time I did it on line and I was given a shorter time to pay back my loan. So now I have to go a competitor of yours to get a loan to pay you back.,1
Problem Gambler,"I love using advance,  been with them over years. However, with the online customer service help, they need to allow authorization from 3rd parties. My husband and i use advance and he cant call due to his job. I have been put on his account to change, update, or pay on his behalf.

Everything started out great after I‚Ä¶,If I'm already in the system why is that going to constantly go back to show my direct deposits and everything else if nothing has changed within the past 90 days it just speeds up the process and delaying it,1
Decent unless you need help,"I find the service acceptable, though, one time it took for ever to get an approval and it cost me. It was a hard pill to swallow.I do believe it was not the local office fault but at the corporate level.That's all I have to say for now.",2

Horrible online service,"Took 25 min to even get to the window to do my transaction.  UPDATE: Received a response from customer service,  Ashley. She was helpful, above and beyond.

The last two months I have done my loan‚Ä¶,Wonderful very patient and kind works with you üòä,1
The computers were down for a long time‚Ä¶,Love everyone that works at the Dillon ax store,2
The clerk that I applied the  loan with‚Ä¶,No help at all and they didn't do a good job.,1
Horrible.,"I spent several hours trying to go online to apply for a loan.  I finally gave up after IT specialist and a customer service person couldn't figure out the problem.  While the customer service rep was very cordial, I went to a local office an took five minutes of my time to obtain the loan I had spent 2-3 hours trying to obtain.  Your online service is deplorable!!!",1
$300 is not enough money at 34% and is‚Ä¶,I took out a loan online and I never received the money.,2
You guys perform well during customer‚Ä¶,I was not happy this time with my Loan I just paid the loan off two months ago and to get the same loan amount I had to show proof my income and then the payment went up $20 more on the month that was uncalled for,1
Very poor online and in store service,Advance America makes it easy to get a small payday loan. Payment plans could be better for customers and larger loan amounts would help people in cocid crisis.,1
Customer service could have been a‚Ä¶,I get SS on the 4th Wednesday each month and this last month the payment was taken out 2 days  early overdrawing my checking account and costing me a fee of $36.   I do not have the same DATE each month it varies and I do not have the money until I get paid.   If this is what is going to happen each month I will have to find another loan that will do it on the day I get SS.The loan I have now is due 2 days again before I get paid and I do not have that kind of money before payday.    Please fix this so it can be done on the customers day of pay.You have helped me out a number of times and do not want to leave.Thank you,2
Always have trouble with the 2 week‚Ä¶,The processes are dated in comparison to other options. Setting up a payment plan or adjusting payment dates requires going into a store which can be inconvenient. Support wasn't helpful in this particular case but have been other times. This will likely be my last time using AA.,2
Customer service doesn‚Äôt answer your‚Ä¶,"For the last 3 months the women who has waited on me has been rude, hateful, and on one occasion has been nosey. I prefer not to go to her but she has been the only one working. I am seriously thinking of changing locations.",1
Misunderstanding with NetSpend about a‚Ä¶,I been dealing with you guys for almost two years and I never miss a payment and my loans stay the same after I pay this loan back I‚Äôm done with the company,1
Applied for a loan got approved then‚Ä¶,Love you guys...your awesome...been good to me...thank you,1
It was impossible to get the testing‚Ä¶,Paid my balance but still called and harassed me three days in a row.,2
on July 3rd I came in for a loan,I took out a loan on April 9th. Recieved money on Monday April 12th. Now I see that on April 21th you will be taking out my 1st payments. Something is not right here. I took this money out to pay some bills. Thinking I was ok and my 1st payment from you would start next month. Why is my payment coming due 2 weeks after I get loan. Can this please be fixed. This is not right at all. Now that puts me behide on a bull. Can this please be changed to next been when my 1st payment is do. Never hear of such a thing.,2
Advance America has help me over the‚Ä¶,Had to wait for my deposit although I was told be there next morning and had to wait till closing next day....when I no longer needed it....,2
Don‚Äôt like the new loan system,I have been a loyal customer. I finally earned the payment plan and paid that as well. I then take another loan and am not offered the payment plan. Now i am forced to repay the entire amount and no further ahead. I am totally disappointed and will no longer be using your services. Darlene C,1
Your manager is very helpful and polite‚Ä¶,The two females they were working there were two grumpy whatever they had going on they were not making the customers happy two grumpy and grouchy,1
Trying to get a loan online here was a‚Ä¶,They have a easy system to use. Plain and simple without extra browser uses.,1
I went online 07/01/21 and paid my loan‚Ä¶,"I spoke with Daisy from corporate. she stated I owed money, as she was on line I open my account an reviewed with her the incorrect statement she made and then confirmed with my bank statement. I also informed her I have been a loyal on time customer for over 2-3 years. and for her to call me with incorrect information and not be knowledgeable of her job. then she tried the blame the employees on the lower level. It was very sad, disappointing and a deal breaker. She could have acknowledge the mistake(her error) and just say we are calling because we notice you have always use ACH now you pay with a debit card and went from there but she tried a  threat game. No more business from me. I will pay my dues and not recommend this service to anyone. NO Stars.",1
The process is normally simple and very‚Ä¶,My payback date keeps getting changed. I have never had a thursday pay back always been fridays. I have called many times and still no change.,1
I have been utilizing the Advance‚Ä¶,The interest rate way too high had i known better i wouldn‚Äôt have took out money,1
When u get a loan it's to much interest‚Ä¶,"Horay, Horay, I am very happy with the different platform and changes you all have made to help us customers with our needs, When your store manager explained the different account I was glad, it also helps me with getting adjusted to help me, Again I thank you with ideas, much faster and less Pape work, I called my friends and told them of the new changes, Kiddos to you all.",1
I came to this location to pay my loan‚Ä¶,I am very angry with my last experience. The lady deposited the amount I asked for into my account and then gave me cash also.  She gave me more than she should have and we did not realize it until after I left.   She called and said she gave me $100 more and asked if I could bring it back.  When I got to the store she said I owed $200 back. I was very upset because I did not have an extra $100. I had already set aside the money for my bills.  After much debate I took a hundred dollars from my bills just to end the argument.  I am now behind on a bill because of this.    As soon as I can I will pay this loan off and never go back to that store.,2
Horrible person I just spoke to,The new personal in Apopka not to pleasant trouble to receive the money. The other CSR were pleasant,1
I have into your store's for a payday‚Ä¶,After giving them my username and password for my bank account. I had to ride to the store to send back the $450 they deposited into my account before they could deposit the funds. The next day the loan was supposed to be available. Needless to say they were not. The phone numbers were disconnected and it's like they vanished from existence.,1
Online/phone authorization,They have always been their for me. Thank you advance america the computer changes you have made are outstanding and so much easier. Again thank you for being their.,2
I called your Co,They didn't put my money on my atm card. How embrassing at the store for my card to decline. I had to go back the next day and get the cash. Not impressed.,1
You should hire friendlier employees,Should have been approved for more in a time of need,2
I have been trying 4 2weeks now just to‚Ä¶,"This company is the absolute company I‚Äôve ever worked with please save your time and money IT IS HORRIBLE don‚Äôt be stupid like me , get a loan elsewhere",2
If I'm already in the system why is‚Ä¶,"One of the cashier representatives has an disdain (lack of respect) demeanor towards clients. Each time I've went into  the store on Greenfield rd. In Oak Park, she has the same attitude. Everyone has bad days. But, this is her norm. Highly unsatisfied with the personal skills of the cashier representative.",2
I find the service acceptable,"I originally started my account with the Haleyville office and was extremely happy with the courtesy ,professionalism, and knowledge of the staff. This office was recently closed down so i had to switch over to another office an hour away from where i live. I have had nothing but one problem after another with the staff at the new office. They are not professional, knowledgeable ,or courteous. I almost lost my vehicle over 0.90 cents due to an error on their part and they never did make it right, so i borrowed $700 from someone and immediately paid off the title loan account. Sadly, i am still in debt for a payday loan. I drove the hour it takes me to get to the office and there was about 10 customers ahead of me. This was on the 3rd of the month when people who receive social security disability get paid. The person who came with me has an account there also and is also disabled and awaiting surgery. We were in severe pain and there were not enough chairs and he had to sit in the floor. When we finally got to our turn, the manager apologized for the wait and i remarked that there are usually 2 staff members in the office to wait on customers and she replied that she had alot of customers earlier and then it got a little slow so she sent that employee to another office to help them. The 1st and 3rd of every month is going to be very busy because this is when people with disabilities get paid and every Advance America office should have at least 2 employees working all day on these 2 days every month. As i stated, these are disabled people who have alot of physical problems and pain already and are not able to endure these long wait times. You have to come in person to renew a payday loan. The staff did recently mention implementing a way to make payments and renew loans straight from a bank account but this method is how i almost got my only vehicle repossessed by Advance America over 0.90 cents so i am too afraid to do it that way. Hopefully, all Americans are about to receive another stimulus check and i am going to use mine to pay off my loan with Advance America and pray i never have to go back again. The person who accompanied me who had to sit in the floor and whose blood sugar dropped too low because he had to wait so long and not have food, is also going to pay his loan off. We have been very good customers for a very long time and your company has made alot if money off of us and would have made alot more, but what started out as a great experience at the Haleyville,Alabama office, turned into a very dreadful experience at the Hamilton,Alabama office.",2
The one star is for your El cajon‚Ä¶,Took my payment out a week early and then would not even acknowledge that they had taken the payment even though it had been pulled out of my bank account I was told to come back for the loan five days later just to be told I need to go to the bank to get my paperwork showing that it had went through my bank and and y'all had collected it even though you acknowledge that it's been paid y'all still wouldn't let me do it and I've been a customer of yours for years I've y'all have not had a problem with me paying paying the loan back I was just trying to pay it back early that way I could go ahead and pay take the loan out right before payday so I'd have a little more time to pay it back again so once it was paid I should have been able to get the loan now I'm broke down on the side of the road because I had to go get the information and no I'm not real happy with the way I was treated not by your customer service,1
Took 25 min to even get to the window‚Ä¶,My experience with online has been the absolute worse.,2
Very rude and confrontational employee‚Ä¶,I left 2 stars only because they would not give me my military discount I did not have my card on me and the lady was kinda rude about it so I wasn't very happy,1
Horrible the worse customer service in‚Ä¶,"I would like to know why - when I am taking an advance why I can‚Äôt repay this in Monthly payments. In the past, I was able to borrow $ 1000 and pay back in monthly payments.What is reason?",1
I had excellent service again I telly‚Ä¶,"5 Star - Excellent customer service and qualified loan amount! They are good with me and the other visitors.0 Star- However, bloody bad interest rates! You can't justify it.",1
Your closing down the local locations‚Ä¶,"Since our local store closed everything has to be done over the phone. Hold time is howards of an hour. Weekend payments don't process until the next business day. You have to call in two days ahead to prevent them from automatically withdrawing payment. When they do it themselves you turn around time to reloan is days. If you do it manually it's immediately...you just have to sit on the phone for a lifetime. All the convenience is gone without the store. Over the phone is horrible. Online is ok, wish they had an actual app.",2
You was very helpful,"Last 2 times I got a payday loan. My payback day was off, I was late on paying back. I get paid every 2 weeks.  I never had issues until recently.  Otherwise customer service is always great!",2
Real nice took no time great service,If I could give you a zero I would. Your phone lines would not answer your chat would not pick up and your online app would not take my signature.Needed the money early morning ended up spending 2 1/2 hours on the app and phone finally ended up driving to a store where had to wait there. The store only had one girl working.,2
Refused to acknowledge payment,I appreciate your  service. Thanks,1
Never received my second loan were its‚Ä¶,"I regret using the store in PRP Kentucky. I usually go to Shepherdsville Ky. At the Pleasure Ridge store. They had some trouble sending part of the money I borrowed to my bank. So went outside to contact my bank. When I came bake in. They had no it the $300.00 on a Netspend card. Having never had a pre-paid card. I ask if it was like a debit card. They said yes. Well, Netspend card charges the individual who possesses it. A 2 dollar fee for spending their own money. So needless to say. Mine doesn't exist anymore. But, not before they got me for upwards of $20.00. If anyone reads this and still purchases a pre-paid card. You're a fool. An idiot! They charge you a fee to spend your money. That's extortion should and I do it. Screw the Dixie Hgwy store.",1
I don't like this don't recommend to‚Ä¶,"Last month was very disappointing.  I paid my bill online, but then when I went to withdraw funds online, I was unable to.  I called the office in Lancaster, and I was informed that they could not extend funds to me because I paid my bill online.  This is very confusing.  I called your office, and the woman who spoke to me was very nasty in informing me that I had been informed as to the policy change which did not allow me to withdraw online right after I paid online. She even went so far as to state that this new change was in my paperwork.  When I asked her where this was cited, she started reading something that had nothing to do with the so-called new policy; and she was as nasty as sin!!!!!  I ended up driving 20 miles again to go into the store for clarification, and I was informed that if I had paid my bill in the store, I was able to do another loan at the same time, and that they were very sorry for the problem.  So, I'm not happy about this at all.  What you advertised as a convenience did not turn out to be a convenience, even though I've been a good customer for a long time.  I don't get it.  This is not good customer service!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
The older lady on  vanborn in Merriman‚Ä¶,I was in the store and had to wait 30 minutes to get waited on because the new system would not work for me then it froze. Other than that service was great.,1
I have been a client for around 20‚Ä¶,It tried to make a payment online it would not let me pay on my due date. It would not take my debit card. It made my check be deposited and I had to wait an entire week for it to clear. The staff at the office were unable to get it cleared. So I was unable to get another loan and had to use an alternative. Their technology sucks they need to update to Real-time payment technology,1
Just not like it uses to be.,somebody filed a loan in my information i tried to file a police report but they said i needed more info i tried to get it from the customer service but they were no help.,2
Wonderful very patient and kind works‚Ä¶,I took out a loan for $1000 I was approved for it I receive $700 cash and a $300 check which I tried to deposit at my bank and they say it‚Äôs already been cashed. So I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on with this. I called the office and they said this happens sometimes and it‚Äôs an issue with the banks. So the bank has the check at the moment it‚Äôs been in a bankers desk since Wednesday of last week. I haven‚Äôt heard from anyone and I‚Äôm really interested in finding out why.,1
Love everyone that works at the Dillon‚Ä¶,On Saturday the customer service rep was so rude!! I will never go back never again,1
No help at all and they didn't do a‚Ä¶,The online process was horrible and that's why  I'm giving it a 2 star. I recommend going into a location which I chose to do after my online experience and the experience was so much better and faster. If I could rate that location I would give them a 5 star rating.,1
I spent several hours trying to go‚Ä¶,The employee was on drugs. Literally kept zoning out and ‚Äúfalling asleep ‚Äú while completing my loan. Will not recommend or return to this place.,1
I took out a loan online and I never‚Ä¶,Well regarding the experience it was a little bit disappointing because I wasn't given all the information I needed. I was told the good thing was that you could do it online you can save time so you can get the money that way but I wasn't told do it online and pick it up at the store because if it's your first time you won't get it until one business day later the problem with that I did it on a Friday and I have to wait until Monday midday to receive it and I did need it on the Friday or Saturday the most then I was told after I called them that I could cancel but it takes 3 days to do the canceling and then I won't be able to get anything either way down until they settled it within the three days so I just left it like that and waited on till Monday I was almost deciding not to get it but if I'm not able to get it again for the second time if and when and that's a big if I need it then I'm not going to deal with her no more and just not go through you guys because you're here to make it easier for us I appreciate it that you're there for our need miscommunication we need better customer service on that form by going above and beyond would be give more information ask question to see what we need as a customer,1
I was not happy this time with my Loan‚Ä¶,"If I could give a half a star or less I would! I never did get the funds in my acct, I told you guys numerous times the acct number was wrong. However I‚Äôm still getting reminders to make a payment on money I have never received!!!",1

I get SS on the 4th Wednesday each‚Ä¶,I have been a customer for a long time and when they tried to do an installment loan it was declined I have always paid u as it needs to be and what really upsets me is that a friend that I recommended u to was able to do one and she ha declared bankruptcy in the past and she had no problem I pay my bills and u of all people should know that Judy Jones,1
The processes are dated in comparison‚Ä¶,I never had any problems up until now. I called to let them know my debit card on file had to be disabled due to my acct being hacked with fraudulent transactions. I was told that my old card would not be processed and to make the payment on my due date with my new card manually. I paid the loan in full and on time but as I tried to apply for a new loan I was denied 3 times only to find out that they still tried to process the payment on the disabled card anyway after I emailed and called a head time to let them know not too. I wanted to get a new loan to keep from getting behind at least until my bank credits my money back in my acct that was stolen from me.,2
For the last 3 months the women who has‚Ä¶,I called n I was supposed to get a call back in 20 min but they never did.,2
I been dealing with you guys for almost‚Ä¶,Online process is to slow. Applied online at about 5pm and still haven't received funds the next day by 3pm. Called and was advised it would be sent by COB today. To sum it up the online process takes about 24 hours.,1
Love you guys...your awesome...been‚Ä¶,Was told when I did my first loan with u that I can add my old man's income for more $$. Was told this time I could not use his income. I was very upset  and disappointed.  Will probably be the last time I deal with u guys.,2
Paid my balance but still called and‚Ä¶,"The new person you have in charge never smiles she acts like she is making you a favor, all other people you had in the pas before her were super friendly, as soon as I can I will pay my loan and never use your services again!",1
Deputing 1st payment!!!!!,"You are quick to withdraw my payment due, but take what seems near an eternity to close ny payday loan! I cant believe it takes that long to clear, when the transaction clears that very same withdrawl date. I will look for someone faster,  on my next payday loan.",1
Interests rates are too high!!,How could you take advantage of the people in need. 300% charge ? That is outrageous!Some people can never get out of the cycle of abuse you are doing.You should be ashamed for taking advantage of the pandemic!,1
Yaw suck!!!,My recent payday advance took 5 business days to clear. Previously I have been able to re-borrow the same exact day I pay my balance.,1
I have been a loyal customer,Have not received my loan and its been more them 2 days and everything they said is the opposite,1
The two females they were working there‚Ä¶,Your manager at this facility need some people skills training. She did not smile once and made me feel as an undesirable for the need to borrow money. If she had personal problems she should keep out of work. I think I‚Äôll go to another store if I have the need again.,1
They have a easy system to use,"My Service Representative was extremely honest...it was the end of my work day - I had to rush getting there,  several ATM machines were down, I finally got the money I needed. Once getting to the store location I had totally forgotten I took out extra funds, so I handed over $800+, and she was extremely honest, made me aware of my error and returned the extra funds. In addition she was thorough, patience and friendly.",1
I spoke with Daisy from Corporate,I went to advance America in Anderson at 10 am no one was there and didn‚Äôt show up until 11 I went to the one in Redding and got my payment done I won‚Äôt be back to Anderson anymore,1
My payback date keeps getting changed,I have been with you guys for years and never had a problem until this last time I took out a loan.Yoy guys held for 5 days cause me late fees on my other bills. I always use my debit card to make my payment and receive my money . However this last time they said I used a check and held it for 5 days which meant I couldn't take out another loan until today but my bills are due last Friday.Nit very happy at allüòû,2
The interest rate way too high had i‚Ä¶,"I applied on the 15th and didn't get my money til the 19th.  I realize there was a holiday, but come on this was rediculous and then on top of that you want me to pay back the money on the 27th.  One week later pay it back.  I get paid once a month, so I have one question for you.  If I was to get another loan on the 1st, and don't get paid til the 24th of February will the money be due on the 24th?  I never had this problem before at the Huntington Beach store.  They always made it due to pay back the 4th Wednesday of the month when I get paid.  I hope I wasn't too hard on you, but it sure was aggravating to get my money.Thank you for listening even if nothing will be done,  Cheri",1
Horay,I needed cash immediately and it was sent to my debit bank card instantly. I also got 25 dollars for referring a new client. Thankyou,2
I am very angry with my last‚Ä¶,"The ladies at the Lancaster Advance America Office have been very helpful, friendly, and very professional over the many years I've done business with Advance America.  They assist me and grant me an extra 2 days for payment every month because I receive Social Security checks on the 3rd of every month, and they understand this.  However, I can't say the same for the online assistance, where I informed them up front that I could not make the recent payment until the 3rd of January (while receiving a bunch of e-mail reminders that my payment was due at the end of December)   Yet, when my Social Security check arrived early to my surprise, they immediately ignored my request and immediately took the funds out of my account on December 31, 2020.  Apparently, my request was ignored even though I've paid in full what I owe consistently and on-time by the 3rd of every month.  Consequently, I do not plan to utilize Advance America anymore.",1
The new personal in Apopka not to‚Ä¶,Excellent service very polite.Was .great explaining everything .,2
Fraudulent,"Never deposited after approved. Also, never responded to my email.",1
They have always been their for me,"I was approved for a new loan on Dec 24th at 7:40 am (with email confirmation), and supposed to have same day deposit. I still do not have the money I really need on the 26th, and now it won't be available until the 28th at the earliest. Then, payment is due already on the 31st?? I have been a long term customer with all loans paid in full. Also, I have had the instant deposit to my debit card in the past. Now all of a sudden I was told it was not an option? I really hope to hear from some one there to discuss what has happened, and maybe even change the payment date at least??? We will see.....",2
They didn't put my money on my atm‚Ä¶,"I am very upset with how long Advance America corporate is taking to return my money back to my card that I over paid them in the amount of $200 because they still processed my check after I paid in person. This time of the year is already stressful and I already had to make my pennies stretch so the fact that it‚Äôs been over a week and the money is still not back in my account is very disappointing and has caused my holidays to be very stressful not to mention they closed my account and won‚Äôt allow me to take out another loan because of my returned payment which their claiming is fraud but that‚Äôs not accurate at all  , so I has to pay $600 all at once and then they took another $200 out my account still ...The fact that I can‚Äôt use their services any longer is probably a blessing in disguise because they really screwed up my account & this should‚Äôve been resolved ,  especially with how advance technology is. It definitely made me never want to take out another pay day advance ever again in life.",2
Should have been approved for more in a‚Ä¶,I would do a zero if I could.... Going through this link sent my information out to tons of people and I started getting spammed within minutes!!!!!,2
This company is the absolute worst company !,Last time i came in to pay i was told that i was late .but in reality i was on time because i have alwas gotten to weeks to pay but the employee only gave me one week .so my account went into collection and my credit score was effected.,1
Cashier Representative,I am not satisfied with the amount. I have done Business with you for quite some time when you were doing payday loans I was doing the maximum of 500 now a personal loan with you you‚Äôre only allowing 260 it makes no sense I have paid you on time every time and don‚Äôt intend to change thank you,1
Down and out in Double Springs,Applied at 9:50am got approved and thought would hit my account that day it didn‚Äôt. It hit next morning at almost 9am! Causing me to get two $36.00 over draft fees. Had I known that I would‚Äôve picked up the cash in store to avoid the  inconvenience! Very upset,1

I would like to know why,"I arrived @ 1:30 pm Friday afternoon 12/18/20, when store opened after lunch break. 6 customers waiting for store to open. I was #4 of 6 in line. To my unbelief only 1 store associate on duty. Cheyenne was only store associate working with 6 people in line for help & the phone ringing off the hook. What Poor Management to only schedule 1 store associate on Friday afternoon. The wait time was 18 minutes for me to finally get helped.Cheyenne did a wonderful job with all the stress of customers looking at her & phone  ringing off the hook.I suggest the Store Manager gets written up for this very poor scheduling. I feel bad for Cheyenne having to go so much stress, but she handled it like a champ. I believe Cheyenne should be the Manager & demote current manager for customers having to wait so long on Friday Afternoon, probably the busiest day of the week.Very unhappy with poor management decisions to not schedule properly & make customers & numerous phone calls to waite while Store Manager isn't even @ work to help on busiest day of week!!!!!",1
Excellent customer service but‚Ä¶,"It's Saturday at 3:09pm and I still don't have my loan deposited into my account seems like I have to wait until Monday which I requested my loan on Thursday night. I wish somebody would have told me that, I needed my loan and don't have it and you guys are wanting a review????? I'm not happy with how things are being done, not a happy customer right now.",2
Since our local store closed everything‚Ä¶,I‚Äôve tried so many times to pay online and every time it won‚Äôt bring up my account it keeps saying that it‚Äôs not right and it is,1
Payday not correct,The process was not clearly explained at all steps by all involved. The website is not easily understood. In the end I think it would have been faster and easier to go in person than to complete it online. Additionally my due date is before my next scheduled pay date which I provided so its confusing how you can expect a payment before I get paid on a payday loan. I emailed customer service and have not received a true response as all I have received is the form do not reply that originates when you submit a question.  Look at their blanket reply to my review. Ridiculous I still have not heard from anyone regarding this.,1
If I could give you a zero I would,"Filled out application, apparently got approved but never got any funds, and no contact from the business!",1
Payday Loans,Everything was nice and easy until it was time to give the cash . I was approved for $700 The store only had $200 cash and gave me a check for $500 unfortunately went to cash the check and it would take 3 days to clear my account. Ended up having to pay $50 to cash the check . Not satisfied at all won‚Äôt be a repeat costumer. If loans are your business might try having the cash to give the costumer. $50 is to much to have to pay to get your check cashed,1
I regret using the store in PRP‚Ä¶,Her attitude is always awful can tell she don‚Äôt like her job,2
Ridiculous Interest Rate,Excellent service and friendly employee. Gets it done wuickly and efficiently.,2
Last month was very disappointing,Rates are ridiculously high. You‚Äôre paying double for a loan. I will not be using this company any longer.,1
I was in the store and had to wait 30‚Ä¶,Well I had to wait 5 business days to apply for another payday loan. Yet you took the money out of my account the day it was due. I applied for another loan on Friday & it still is not in my account. I am not a very happy customer right now & I think in the future I will have to consider another company who can meet my needs especially in these difficult times,2
Technology Sucks,My account is considered open and my billing cycle has started yet the money has yet to be deposited into my account. Not a good start.,1
somebody filed a loan in my information‚Ä¶,I was very dissatisfied with the fact I had to wait 6 days before being able to re borrow.,1
I took out a loan for $1000 I was‚Ä¶,"Due to bad luck I got sucked into the payday loan crap. Advancee America then takes the payment from me and does not credit it for 8  days while I am hurting.  Screw advance America and you dumb ass employees, but until I can get out of the payday loan scam I am screwed.  MERRY CHRISTMAS hope y'all enjoy your coal but you don't even deserve that and y'all need to grow a pair and quit being snowflakes.",1
On Saturday the customer service rep‚Ä¶,"I was approved for $255, but what was deposited into my account was $204. Would like an explanation.",1
Very friendly,PC kept losing connection...took forever ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èEmployee automatically assumed I wanted max amount instead of asking me how much üí∞I wanted to borrow ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èAlso I had them remove info in my notes...... hopefully it will stay removed!,1
Online service not recommended,"as long as i have been doing business with you there is no reason for me not to be able to get a 1,000.00 doller personal loan",2
The employee was on drugs,The in-store services are wonderful. However I have had problems on two occasions with the on-line service. I will only do business in the future if needed  with the store fronts.,1
Well regarding the experience it was a‚Ä¶,"This new manager at this location, is not friendly at all. She always seem to have a bad attitude. She never smile, or say hello. Yesterday one person was helping me, and then the manager came and took over. They never apologized, or stated the reason for changing. I only come here because it‚Äôs convenient for me. No good customer service here.",2
If I could give a half a star or less i would!,I am really upset that my amount won't go up. the men in the office are Clueless on how to help.  I am locked in 350 dollars everytime i loan  it never goes up.   there is no upper management to talk to. or fix  this.    very disturbing,1
The company is very helpful and caring‚Ä¶,The lady that helped me with the loan was very very nice. But the loan itself was of no help to me. It wasn't enough. It was a waste of my time to even go in there.,2
I have been a customer for a long time‚Ä¶,The store base is good. Main office won‚Äôt answer calls and internet doesn‚Äôt response at all.,1
I can‚Äôt get more 200.00,Immediate pay is offered if you use a debit card and it never works. I've done it 3 times and never have immediate cash put in my account like it offers.,2
I never had any problems up until now,Well so far its not going like i hoped the money is not im my bank yet and been needing this this morning to get some things done fast.. So 2 stars for slow none acting service.. I was expecting faster service that this..But i guess it is the way you delay the way i get my money. Thank youTeri Walton,1
I called n I was supposed to get a call‚Ä¶,Receptionist is really not helpful. Keep asking her questions not paying attention to me. Looking at her phone more than attending to me.,1
Online process is to slow,Why A. America reported to my credit bureau?????,1
Was told when I did my first loan with‚Ä¶,I requested $200 and received $250.  Not sure how you handle these types of situtions.  This means a large pay-off next month.  :(,2
The new person you have in charge never‚Ä¶,She was a new employee.  She  was noted friendly  as the others.,2
You are quick to withdraw my payment‚Ä¶,I think-that it‚Äôs good what y‚Äôall are doing for as the loans to help the people but the interest is way too high people are in trouble we need help right now and I feel like y‚Äôall are take advantage of people in their time of needs and that‚Äôs  not right and after I pay this loan back I will not be getting another one and I know other people that need help but I want tell them about this payday loan because it‚Äôs will get a lot of people I trouble because of the interest I really didn‚Äôt pay attention to how much I was paying y‚Äôall back until I took out this loan and I was amazed like wow never again.,1
Outrageous!,"They got rid of credit/debit card deposits, the deposit to account option just isn't quick enough. Bring it back please. I'd usually just do the pickup in store option but my work schedule makes that extremely difficult and the nearest store to me is no longer as close as it use to be since i moved recently",1
My recent payday advance took 5‚Ä¶,It wasn't difficult getting the loan but they didn't have money so I had to take the check to three different places and it cost almost 50.00 to cash it once this loan is paid back I won't be using them again.,1
Have not received my loan and its been‚Ä¶,The representative did not take the Covid crisis seriously until I had to make a personal phone call to her after leaving a complaint with the corporate office. She was small talking with an unmasked visitor in the store wealth of maximum customers allowed sat waiting we wore our masks but she in the unmasked customer spent an exceptional amount of time talking about the large gatherings that they had attended. I felt extremely vulnerable and when I voiced my concerns to her and advised that I had lost Family members she made light of the situation,1
Manager sourness,I have called and emailed no response I paid my installment loan off via immediate debit and has cleared with my bank but you have yet to clear it  ?? Why???,2
My Service Representative was extremely‚Ä¶,Money still has not deposited into my bank account,1
I went to advance America in Anderson‚Ä¶,I applied for a loan at 8:15 am today and have yet to receive a deposit into my account! The money should‚Äôve been deposited by now.,2
I have been with you guys for years and‚Ä¶,Always friendly and efficient.  Thank you Vanessa,1
I applied on the 15th and didn't get my‚Ä¶,I wanted to apply for a payday loan as I have in the past and it did not give me that option this time. My paydays land on the 5 th & the 20 th every month and I did not give me the option to pick those dates either. üòî,1
I needed cash immediately and it was‚Ä¶,"The employee didn't know how to help me sign up,  when I asked questions she didn't know. Her name was Melinda I believe. I didn't get the money instantly, 3 days later. Very inconvenient.",1
The ladies at the Lancaster Advance‚Ä¶,This is my first time having a bad experience. I applied for a loan around 8 am and got the money about 5 pm. However the representatives that I spoke with were very courteous and knowledgeable.,1
Excellent  Service,"Ok, I appreciate the new system, and doing things on line. But I went to do a loan on line , and it worked fine, and I re loaned and the money was in my account by 4:45 pm . All good . When the loan was due the next time it was taken out of my account automatically, still no problem, it cleared my bank, but when I got off work the advance American said I couldn‚Äôt Re loan because the system did it as an ACH , and not a debit . Which meant I had to wait till the next Wednesday for it to clear the advance America system . Maybe more of an alert would help for customers  to know this . It does state it in the agreement but It is easily over looked . In better news if I could make it to Wednesday‚Äôs without Re loaning , I figured I might as well get out all together. So it worked out well for me .",1
Never deposited after approved,I had applied for a loan online got approved but has not hit my bank,1
I was approved for a new loan on Dec‚Ä¶,Horrible refused to accept what my company gives as info.,2
Screwed up my bank account ‚Ä¶,"I have had several loans with you, and you just denied me. I don't think I will use you again, thank you.",1
I would do a zero if I could...,I have always got a loan with you guys but all of a sudden im denied.  Why?,1
Last time i came in to pay i was told‚Ä¶,"Great job!  The process was flawless, I provided my documents and the funds were deposited directly into my account within 24 hours.",1
I am not satisfied with the amount,"Old Asian lady is rude as hell, she‚Äôs obviously miserable and her customer service is ass.",1
Applied at 9:50am got approved and‚Ä¶,Waited 10 - 15 minutes outside before the employee came from the back to let me in. This store is going down hill fast. I don‚Äôt think I will be going back once I get my loan paid off. I will go somewhere else.,1
The office here in Eustis is great,First you guys had me sign a document saying that I was approved for a loan done around two something a.m. I had received the email saying that sorry I was not approved for the loan so why would I needed my signature and sign something that I wasn‚Äôt approved for,1
I got approved for an online payday‚Ä¶,Every time I go I am treated with so much respect and dignity. This last  visit was quite different. And I believe was my.last visit here. I felt like an intruder. The person asked my social a few times and my name despite me giving her my identification. She proceeded to tell me that I wasn't in the system and I just seemed to annoy her. I was polite and asked questions because her silence other than telling me what she needed and that I wasn't in the system was uncomfortable. Not the normal here.,2
Kara was so polite and patient,I just borrowed the money like 3 days ago and yesterday i am already receiving calls and emails for payment tomorrow so irs useless borrowing from you if you want us to pay it right away..not even 10 days.it is always like that.you can check my history,2
I arrived @ 1:30 pm Friday afternoon‚Ä¶,"I do not how this scam of a company is still doing business.  Out of curiosity I completed the first step: that alone signs I ignored. The second step was truly scary and things one should never share online.  I was being asked by Jonathan Burke, whom referred to me as ""Mr. Gerardo,"" and not Mr. Rodriguez, to supply him with the following: Driver's licence and Social Security number along with my username and password for online banking, debit card number, expiration date and CVV.  Really? Username and password? I might have been born day before yesterday, but I know better. I stopped the process.What concerns me is the rating this ""business"" has received.  I will hazard a guess and write that the others whom supposedly received a loan from this ""business,"" gave out their personal (online) banking information. I find that incredibly difficult to believe. Most likely they are fake reviews; perhaps people paid to write positive reviews for Advance America.I do not believe Advance America will like or reply to this review.STAY AWAY from Advance America!!!",1
It's Saturday at 3:09pm and I still‚Ä¶,Absolute worst company to deal with. Very unprofessional management. Manager of store has lied on 3 diffrent ocassions.,2
My money has not yet been deposited.,Best n excellent service. Always greeted by Mary or Nicole when I arrive. No complaints from me,2
I‚Äôve tried so many times to pay online‚Ä¶,"The process with receiving the loan, was stress free but then I received an email, stating that my payment was return, when I was the one, who went online to make the payment. Not good Advance America.",2
The process was not clearly explained‚Ä¶,"Yes you did great, I meant to do all the stars in green. Thank you very much",2
Puzzled with this company,Late payments shouldn‚Äôt be ACH in one day it should at least have a 6 hour grace period the following day then ACH. Like for my self  I am supervisor At Dollar general DC so you know I had the money I was just extremely busy at work trying to meet deadline. Then boom! But great company,2
Everything was nice and easy until it‚Ä¶,They need to tell you when you do an online loan that it is better to repay with a debit card on line. My pymt was deducted automatically from my checking acct and cleared my bank the day it was due.  But I couldn‚Äôt reloan because it takes 5 days for it to process. Never had this happen before.,1
Her attitude is always awful can tell‚Ä¶,"Every month when i go to pay they are never there gone to lunch for hours but yet they text wanting my payment#!!Alexander City , Al",1
Excellent service and friendly‚Ä¶,They didnt give me the whole amount i could have borrowed I will never be going there again,1
Rates are ridiculously high,I did the online application to pick the cash up in store. The application took 26 hours to get approved. Then the store closed for 2 1/2 hours after it was finally able to be picked up. Overall very bad experience.,2
Well I had to wait 5 business days to‚Ä¶,"Go into a store if you have one. This was my first time applying online. I applied at 7:30 am eastern standard time. And it says anything approved before 1030 will be deposited by 5pm. Well, it was approved within minutes. It‚Äôs 3:30. And still nothing. Would feel much more at ease having my bills paid with cash in hand.",1
My account is considered open and my‚Ä¶,"Ms. Mignon is a phenomenal employee who goes above and beyond to help her customers.  However,  there is another employee (I think she's the manager) who is rude, very short and rude to her customers,  and will hang up on you if you call with a question.  She speaks down to you when you are in their office and seems to dislike helping people.  If at all possible,  I would only have dealings with Ms. Mignon,  but I don't know what her schedule is.  So I'm going to pay back my loan and if I find myself needing another, I will go elsewhere.   As there are so many choices,  it's disappointing that the company has not provided better training to their managers. She knows exactly what she is doing,  and she knows she will continue to get away with it. If you are reading this, go somewhere else! But if you do decide to go here, ask for Ms. Mignon. She will treat you with the dignity and respect that everyone deserves.",1
I was very dissatisfied with the fact I‚Ä¶,It is now 10:17AM CST. I applied and ws approved for a new loan at #:`3 AM.No money at my bank.,2
Due to bad luck I got sucked into the‚Ä¶,"The location I usually use is closing so they could not do any loans. I then went to the next closest location and was told I could not borrow until the next day which was the 31st. I told them I get paid on the 29 or 30 but she insisted I would have to wait, I then called another location and was told I could borrow. I was very upset because the new location was quite a distance to drive back to. It was totally inconvenient,",1
I was approved for $255,I still have not received my money,1
PC kept losing connection.,I wasn‚Äôt  given  all the information about the new policy of Obtaining a loan,1
as long as i have been doing business‚Ä¶,I haven't been funded and no one will return my text ! No telephone number to call !,1
The in-store services are wonderful,Misleading interest rate info provided by staff. Staff says only $20 interest on $100. They forget to add that it is for a 2 week period only. The info sheet in the store 9on the wall) shows an APR of 533%+ which the staff does not let you know. All info should be clearly explained by staff prior to processing loan so that customer knows how much trouble he is getting into.Store is clean and good for social distancing. Staff was courteous and helpful.,1
Horrible attitude,I still have not received any money... disappointed in all customer service,2
I am really upset that my amount won't‚Ä¶,"The last rude rep I spoke to reversed my loan!!! I told her I wish I had done it a few days later to be due the following paycheck. She told me that there was no guarantee on how soon I could redo the loan. So to be safe I said I‚Äôll keep it how it is. The money got spent on bills. Now you‚Äôre trying to reverse it????  Please leave the loan how it was , I never signed anything to cancel the loan or authorized it to be canceled. You will make multiple things in my account bounce. If your rude rep did this in retaliation, please fix ASAP!!!Thank you and this is the first time I‚Äôve had any issue with your company. And the first time the customer service was horrible. I will correct my review if they fix the issues caused on my account. Allison W10/29- I had to solve the situation with my bank. Long process to supposedly try to fix Advance America‚Äôs mistake. A lot time & frustration. Supervisor seemed willing to help but wasn‚Äôt reachable at my non work hours. She said she had to listen to my calls & look at my emails... I knew she‚Äôd see I wasn‚Äôt lying, but still a bit insulting. After I was proven right after hearing the call, I still had to wait for her to find the emails. This was ridiculous dealing with from 10/21-10/28. Could have left a solution through my email which I gave permission but still wouldn‚Äôt. Or even fix the account so the notes would be there for any rep to read to me. So there were multi-phone rep issues and multi email issues. I gave up & will just be paying the loan off in full tomorrow.  FYI: if my bank wasn‚Äôt kind enough to fix this for me, it would have cost me 4 NSF charges and all 4 items returned. And those places could charge returned charge fees as well. So disappointed!AW",2
The lady that helped me with the loan‚Ä¶,My local store has always been a place I have enjoyed going and a much needed financial relieve during tough times. Until this past Friday. I found the employee to be rude. Even worse was the manager stood right there and let his employee be rude and hateful. They did not have enough cash and somehow tried to make me feel like that was my fault. I will be taking my business elsewhere.,2
The store base is good,I was told I was approved for a loan and would receive it by the next morning...its day 2 im waiting now. The whole purpose was to apply for emergency  help. Smh never again,2
Immediate pay is offered if you use a‚Ä¶,I'm at Advance America at 2:15 and the place is closed until 3:00. They need to put the correct hours on the web page.,2
Well so far its not going like i hoped‚Ä¶,"I was told that documents would be sent via email, but never sent. When I called I received no help.",2
Receptionist is really not helpful,i am very upset actually because i was approved yesterday for this loan and was supposed to be in my account this morning and wasnt and i have sent emails asking whats up and no answer   but the really nice thing is i have a payment due in one week for money i havent gotten yet and im on a 2 week pay schedule i mean i decided to do this loan even though it is extremely high interest because i was desperate to get it in one day and now it seems at the soonesr it will be 3 days since banks dont work on sundays and i didnt get it today so if i could rate less than 1 i would  thank you!,1
Why A,Can't get any answers and if I could leave no stars I would.  Still haven't received my funds,1
I requested $200 and received $250,"I applied for a loan 9/14 the due date was 10/13.  Knowing my Payday was on the 14th, I withdrew first loan and applied for a loan 9/15.  The due date didn't advance one day to meet my Payday.  It stayed at 10/13 causing me endless problems.",2
John does the most amazing job,Your customer service representative was top notch professional!!Your top management does not know what they are doing because it closed the Lyon Township office...very poor customer service by top management!!,2
She was a new employee,Ok. They approved me for my loan I agreed to the terms. Then they tried to make me pay 100 dollars first then they would make a western union transfer or money gram only they would not accept my  account numbers through an FDIC backed banking establishment. I use my netspend card only if it's good enough for the govt why not a advance america? When you can only do what you can do and have no way to pay the tax thing they ask for because you pay your bills. Why then would you pay a loan place up front you'd take all applicable taxes out of the loan amount and the loan would be settled on their monthly withdrawals from your account. Bad business burden. The rates good the loans good customer service and hoops bad.,2
I think-that it‚Äôs good what y‚Äôall are‚Ä¶,I haven't received my funding as promised,1
They got rid of credit/debit card‚Ä¶,If give them zero if I could.  You pay and pay make all your payments every month and it‚Äôs never paid off hmm.  Never use this it‚Äôs awful,2
It wasn't difficult getting the loan‚Ä¶,Haven‚Äôt received my money yet and they said it will be in my account today!,2
The representative did not take the‚Ä¶,I applied for a online loan on a Saturday around 4ish and they aren‚Äôt letting me receive my fund until a Tuesday all over it being Columbusday and stating banks aren‚Äôt open even thought my local Advanced America says I could receive it on that holiday. And my bank is open. I called and asked if there was anyway to expedite the process so I can get the money today and they offered no help. Not very happy with my first time ever using this kind of service. I will not be returning.,1
Poor customer service,"the day I went in there, I had changed bank accounts, unfortunately, and forgot to bring my bank statement. My phone was not working, and I was trying to get it activated, nothing was working, so I went home, and got my statemen. After I came back, I was treated kind of rudely, I thought, because, the girl working that morning, was too busy flirting with the guy ahead of me to try to get to me, after I already been there an hour before with all the technical problems. I've been going there for years, so she knew me, that's why I felt the way I did. I know, I was a problem, because she had to wait to see if I could get my phone to work, but, I didn't keep her waiting long. I just drove back home and grabbed my bank statement.",1
Money still has not deposited into my‚Ä¶,"I used your service and had the transaction done with my debit card. The money was deposited on my debit card and was to withdraw the payment on the debit card. I was NEVER told that the transaction could take up to 10 days. Unfortunately I had checks that bounced and three trips to your store, which is 40 miles round trip. I will not recommend to anyone to use your service using their debit card. I am happy with your service, but not using debit card.",1
Can‚Äôt cash check,Not the best being continually charge when office gets new office managers Just want my payment s to be applied correctly and honestly. Just want to get this over. Not roll over but Over,1
I applied for a loan at 8:15 am today‚Ä¶,"When I needed a little help, I thought I could get it from here. A LITTLE is all I got. Even though I would have it all paid back before the end of the month!",2
Always friendly and efficient,I'm not pleased with y'all at all I'm very angry I've been doing business with yall since hurricane Michael off and on. The first year when y'all started doing installment loans I applied after doing business with yall for a complete year y'all turned me down I go angry and refused to pay y'all got by your money I quit the payday loan I have a emergency so I'm back doing business with yall again y'all refuse to give me a installment loan Again so I'm looking for a replacement for y'all no worries y'all will get your damn mny but my business is going elsewhere y'all have really pissed me off .im gonna check with a lawyer and see what he says by by and FU,1
Online app to make payment not good,Your help during my time of need is very appreciated.   But my payday is Friday and your system always insist on the payment on Thursday.   I can't pay the day before I get paid.,1
I wanted to apply for a payday loan as‚Ä¶,Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,2
The employee didn't know how to help me‚Ä¶,The young women who are normally there are very friendly but on the third when i went there this women who I've never seen she was very corporate first she called which i didn't request a call or wanted if you look at my record I'm never late or request a call so I feel like she took it upon herself that's not leadership. You should know good customers from one's who are always late and need a call or request it.,2
This is my first time having a bad‚Ä¶,"WILL NOT...be using advance American again. Reason one it doesn't give cash for its vehicle title loans , reason two the checks that they issue can't be cashed at a major bank and third they couldn't load the net flex card i tried to use , for these reasons i WILL NOT use advance American again!!!!",2
ACH or debit clarity,"Do to others AS you want done for yourself.  Sound familiar?  Our Creator said it.  We are all accountable to Him.  A reasonable interest rate is like a credit union (Tyndall.org is very low but they do well and so does the world's largest credit union, Navy Federal Credit Union).  The reason I borrow is because I give my money to people I don't even know to help them.  Ever heard what our Creator said through His sinless Son about not storing up treasurers on earth?  And that it's more blessed to give than to receive?  No one can out give Jehovah and Jesus.  Be Blessed when you are not greedy.",1
I had applied for a loan online got‚Ä¶,"Ever since Jessica left, it seems like that location is falling apart. Not very friendly.

It doesn‚Äôt seem like she knows what she‚Äôs doing, it takes forever to get out of the store, where before it was so quick.",1
Horrible,I am so glad you asked cuz I'm very confused are you don't see anywhere we're alone amounts to 26235 but that is what I was charged I would really appreciate some clarification on that,1
You denied me,why are you closing your Huntington store will not drive 25miles to Wabash store will go to check into cash here in Huntington thanks anyway,1
I have always got a loan with you guys‚Ä¶,Got a loan from this place online. They get their money on the same day the loan is due and clears that night. Their system says 3 to 5 business days to clear which is a crock. This is not the 80s no longer where it takes that long. I called and asked if the lady could just verify that it cleared and same response. Have to wait 3 business days which means I'm waiting 5 since its the weekend. Would recommend staying away from this place if you need money faster and on limited income as they could care less and still running like its the 80s.,1
Great job,"I sometimes have money problems, and you guys are not very flexible when it comes to paying back the loans if I get on a payment plan I feel like if I only have $50 that payday that all I should have to pay that keeps me from borrowing more from you cause you split into 3 payments  I can't always afforded that",2
Old Asian lady is rude as hell,I applied yesterday and have gotten no feedback on whether it was approved or not. As far as I‚Äôm concerned I‚Äôll never deal with this company again. The process is not supposed to take this long,1
Waited 10,You guy charged my account one ahead of my set pay date for no reason. I retired I get paid on the last day of each month. This month(September)has 30 days in it. You guy took the funds on the 29th of this month for no reason. Not good. My account was overdrawn and in the negative.,2
First you guys had me sign a document‚Ä¶,All stores close to me are closed on Tuesdays unable to get service,1
Every time I go I am treated with so‚Ä¶,"Had a mishap happen when I attempted to login to my account. In the middle of a transaction, the site logged me into another account, which caused me to pay off their loan unknowingly and get one in their name as well. When I confronted the company, they said their systems don't glitch and would not listen to what happened because they just wanted money and they owe me 300. You never contacted me like you claimed.",2
I just borrowed the money like 3 days‚Ä¶,"I had a horrible experience last week when I tried making my payment. Your computer was done; that I understand but the incompetence of your ppl was over the pale. I will never return to your storefront on Semoran Blvd. Since your manager, Betsy, left, it has not been the same. They barely speak English & the fact I gave them my debit card & they claimed it didn‚Äôt go through because  of the computer & to try later in the day. I happened to go to my bank and I find out the payment had gone through, the money was deducted from my account! I called these ppl back and asked for a receipt since the payment had gone through & no one could send me a receipt. I even called your corporate office & got nowhere. So you had my money but I had no proof except for my bank. To get a copy from my bank would cost me a fee. It was horrible and I ended up with chest pains. I finally got an email from your corporate office at 11:45 pm that night, almost 12 hours after the money was deducted from my account.I have been a customer for over 12 years and I have never seen such incompetence. I had to get some money yesterday but I went to the storefront where I always went for years. I followed your employee Betsy to the other store, but now that she is gone and after my experience last week, I will never return. I will get you paid off and never return. I used to give you five stars. No more.",2
My Experience,Ayanna was very helpful and shes a very nice person,1
Absolute worst company to deal with,No offense but I do better when I go into the office because at least I get my money then I still haven't gotten my money 3 days later going online and doing this crap,1
You denied me a loan,Staff was wonderful HOWEVER I received this review questionare BEFORE I have received the money..The money that was supposed to be INSTANTLY deposited in my account is NOT  yet deposited !!! This has caused me extreme problems because the money was for a family medical EMERGENCY!! I had thought twice about useing Advance America because this EXACT same thing happened to me the.last time. Last time I had used the on line service so this time I went in person to the store hoping to avoid any problems...apparently it makes no difference!!! I probably will never use Advance America again!!!Only reason they got any stars is because the staff was very nice.,1
Best n excellent service,It said I would get my money in 30 minutes and it's been over 24 hours and still do not have my money.,1
Not good Advance America,Simply put - the last two times I‚Äôve used your company u had no cash on hand.   Then it cost me money to cash ur check (which two places would not honor)!!!!   Won‚Äôt use u again if u do not keep cash on hand.   J Campbell,1
Yes you did great,The customer service was great! They gave me a check for some unheard of bank that was rude and told me they only have part time tellers by apt only! I don't have a regular bank cost me $15.00 to cash the check! I am not happy. I was told they would let someone know. Not fair to me as a customer at all!,1
Late payments,I don't know who this lady was the day I went but she's rude as hell. Her customer service skills is none existing. She had her mom or someone on the speaker phone the who time.

Online loan payments,"They advertise that they give loans ""up to $1,000!""  This is BS.  I make an average of over $7k/month and have PERFECT credit on 20 open lines of credit and yet was only given $400, presumably because my FICO score was only a 620, which is low due to credit cards being maxed out, which is why I needed to come to this lender of last resort in the first place.  People that come here have low FICO scores (usually because they have bad credit), not because they enjoy paying 90% APR to borrow money for short term periods.  Offering to loan $1k to people with high FICO scores when you charge 90% interest is a baseless claim, as no one with a high FICO score would borrow money at such ridiculous rates - they would just go to their bank.  Like most other payday lenders, they only really loan $400, although both ACE and MoneyTree loaned me $1k each, so I would suggest taking your business there instead of visiting these clowns.",2

I went in for a payday loan and i wanted it deposited directly to my bank. she scanned by debit card and told me she was getting an error ""funds not available""? For a deposit. Anyhow I didnt want to argue with her cause she immediately told me shed have to give me cash, which I don't prefer. So I had to take the cash to my bank for deposit which i dont feel safe doing and its inconvenient. I had also gone in on Saturday, 9/12/20, and when she pulled up my account she asked if i get my next check on 10/14. I told her i wasnt sure of the date but it is the second wednesday. Her response was ""You cant get a loan today. I asked why and she said i had to wait till 9/14. Doesnt converse in a friendly manner at all. Also I received a coupon to get $20 off next loan or payday. How do I get this?",1

I was told I could not get a loan with you guys even though told my credit was good with you all and you all did not understand why that wS happening. And now I can finally get a loan with you all and all I can get is 100.00 dollars. I am very hurt do please don‚Äôt ask me for a review.,1

I've never had a problem until August 2020 (I've been a customer many times over there previous years). I just got loan and that transaction went fine except they took the first payment out 2 weeks BEFORE I was paid, draining my bank account, leaving my account in the red, with no way to fix it. $35 a day overcharge fee for 2 weeks. I will never use this company again.",2

I worked 2 jobs for 7 years trying to avoid having to file bankruptcy after getting laid off from one job and then having a bunch of things break down on me. Unfortunately, I ended up having medical issues that left me no choice but to discharge my debt. As much as I didn't want to, there was a sense of relief to not have debt collectors constantly calling. That was short-lived, however. Advance Americal started calling and demanding payment. I did realize they were missed on the paperwork, although since the debt was incurred before my discharge they are still included. My lawyer contacted them and they stopped calling for 6 months before they started again. I let them know again that it was discharged, the woman on the phone just yelled at me that they were just trying to collect what I owed even after I pointed out it was discharged. At this point, they won't stop calling (a couple of times a day) and I may have to pay another lawyer. They know the debt was discharged, they're just hoping if they harass me enough I will pay the debt even though legally I don't have to. I'm editing this to add that I called the customer comment line and was told by the bot after they verified my account that they are closed for Christmas and will open again on the 26th. For the record, I am calling on January 21. At this point, 3 years after I incurred the debt and 2 years after I declared bankruptcy, I am getting 3-4 calls a day from Advance America. I may have to change my number because each time I block their number they just call from a different one. Plain and simple, this is harassment. Now I will have to get another lawyer. Seriously, there are better places to get loans from, just go somewhere else.",1

My local store has always been a place‚Ä¶,My experience for this application was abysmal. The store experience has been excellent. The only reason that I stopped using you in favor of Amscot is due to your closed on Sunday and Amscot‚Äôs having a 24 hour location in Palm Bay. We needed a payday advance last night around 10 pm and the spouse has been using your application for a bit so I decided to give your application a try. So I put in the first application. I realize there would be no way I would get it that night but the small print at the bottom said it would appear in the bank the next day. I didn‚Äôt worry about it until I woke up just before work and found the money had not deposited and I had an email telling me to ‚Äúresign‚Äù the paperwork which I did. This was at 10:08 am. The second application that was entered. I called and talked to a representative about this second application which stayed in Pending Review. She informed me it was approved. 10 minutes later I receive another email telling me that my application was not approved and was awaiting more information. I called the second time and was told that email was sent in error. I was going to cancel the application and go back to Amscot but I was told it would take an hour for it to clear. The money did show up right at 5 pm causing me to miss lunch due to not having the money I needed when I needed it. If I had just gone to Amscot in the first place a lot of stress would have been avoided.,1
I was told I was approved for a loan‚Ä¶,I have been a very good customer for many years. The gentlemen that assisted me with the new loan told me he needed to do a credit check and it would not show up on my credit. I told him how important it was that it did not show up on my credit. He assured me that it would not. Well it did and it's going to be on there for 2 years. I will never do business with this company again!,2
‚Å∑Hours of operation,"Person who waited on me could not understand the information.  VERY VERY slow - not friendly.  Did not have on a Mask - when I entered, then that person put on a Mask.  Person who worked there about a year or two ago was VERY NICE, FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL.  This visit a week ago was horrible.",2
Did not receive my email documents.,"I called in to see if this location cold assist people who use Instacart and they said yes. I walk in after working 6 hours on a very hot day and I was treated so rudely I could not believe what was happening. The person at the counter did everything she could possibly do to stop me from getting a loan all while saying I've never done this before and that I wouldn't qaualify because my gross income and net income were not written out in bold letters on my bank statements. From her saying saying she has never heard of Instacart, a business she is supposed to offer services for to her questioning why my income fluctuated is beyond disturbing. I was told to bring in my bank statements and I did everything I could do to explain to a young girl who has no business handling people's finances while she uses her phone to text right in front of me when I ask her what my loan amount is makes me so angry. I repeated what I needed to over and over and she didn't listen to a word of it only to ask me if my bank account was actually open. She made me calculate my income with a pen and paper when I handed her all the info that was required. She called multiple managers to hand hold her through the process telling them I wouldn't qualify. At the end I asked her what my limit was and she said it be something like 250 which is what I needed to get my car going. When I told her that would be fine she said sorry actually umm it's 150 and laughed. To think that she would personally allow  me to only get what she thought was okay makes me sick. I asked her why is did that and she said sorry I don't know. When signing my agreement I was reading through the fine print only to be told you don't ha e to read that you will get it emailed makes her sound like a crook. At the end when she handed me what she thought I deserved I asked her what would be the corporate office number and she shut me down and said why would you want that and that if I had any complaints I should call the store manager as that was my only option. I waited till the end not knowing if she would deny me a loan because I may put in a complaint. Took her 3 times to give up her name to me. I have a feeing nothin .ore than a slap to the wrist will be handed down to a young adult who who should be immediately removed from the job despite not knowing her training because she smiles and knods her head to the right people. If anyone can find out what amount for a loan was actually permitted and what she gave is is the same or not will tell you what kind of person she is and make me wonder how many people or family's she will treat unprofessionaly because they just got off of work and are not dressed to impress for her",1

The end of wickedness is coming fast but most people will not pay attention until it's too late sadly.

Simply put,"I usually have great service at this location (9112 Camp Bowie W Blvd Ste 120 in Ft Worth) but recently there has been a high turnover at this location and new management.  Also, because of my experience there yesterday I will never do business at here again!  And I've been a loyal customer for years.  We were in the middle of a transaction and a lady walked in screaming and causing a scene. She demanded that one of the two employees, that were both busy helping customers, stop what they were doing and take her loan payment right now.  She was threatening everyone in the building if she didn't get help.  She was cursing and going in and out of the building.  The manager firmly asked her to leave so then the customer wanted to talk with a supervisor in which the manager gave her a phone number.  I told the M.I.T., Katherine, that she needs to do something about it because I felt threatened and my nerves were bad.  This was a volatile environment and I refuse to do business with anyone who will not rectify the situation immediately.  I also asked them if they still had to locks for he doors and they just ignored me.  The lady went out and came back in two to three times and what if one of those times she brought a gun back.  The issues with this scenario are several: the management never escalated the manner, the management also did not even attempt to protect the customers already present, and didn't even apologize to us for the horrible experience.  Corporate needs to address and resolve this complaint immediately!",1

I will post review and post full page‚Ä¶,Used the online application for the first time and it was a horrible experience.  Agent that I talked to messed up my bank account information so the money was sent to a non opened account even after I called in and provided the correct account information.

Planning prevents pass poor performance!,You are truly an awesome an wonderful people to go to. Always attentive with a kind way of making your customers welcome. God Bless you always. Carmen Reyes,1
Posted a review a couple days ago,Your website is not good. For example today I have tried three times to make a payment. And I called to hear that there are long wait times. So now I have to wait and guess when your website will be running again. Disappointed.,1

Went in to get a loan went thru the‚Ä¶,Another change of policy that required me to return to the store a total of 2 times to be able to take out another loan.,1
I signed a contract to have the money‚Ä¶,Your new system is great!  But  calling for info after hours your  robo gives wrong info for examples times open .,1
You did very badly,Imagine Advance America is your buddy that always says he's here to help. But when you go ask for his help he wants too much for his help so it's almost not even worth it. But in a bind it does help. 5 month loan of $340 cash in hand out the door. But you gotta pay $100 a month for 5 months. So on $340 you have to pay $160 extra. Which is about half of what they gave you. So expect to pay back X1.5. I'm on disability and they made it easy to get a loan. But at the same time my tight budget is stretched pretty far by an extra $100/month. Avoid unless you absolutely need the money. The process is quick and easy. But paying back the money can be a hassle. That's how their company is designed.  It's a predatory loan for low income people struggling to make ends meet. I didn't want to put extra on my credit cards this month so I got a loan out and it would've been cheaper to put it on credit. Luckily I'm in a pretty good position and I'm just using the money to build a computer. The extra $160 im paying is worth not waiting another month or 2 to complete my build while keeping my credit card utilization low. Dont make it a regular thing. Get the loan in a pinch and forget they exist.,1
Fraud,Everytime I try to log in ...it won't accept my.password and makes me get a different one ...over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over...get the.point ?!,1
When I was buzzed into the office,Great customer service. Very productive loan company.,2
You guys deposited my money in the‚Ä¶,The girl at the counter was very unprofessional not very knowledgeable at her job either very unsatisfied with her attitude and her ability to do her job UNSATISFIED CUSTOMER!!,1
Some folks are clueless,"My honest opinion, in the past I never had a problem getting my money deposited into my bank account the same day. Just this week when I applied for a loan, someone dropped the ball on their end, and it took them three days for me to get my money deposited into my bank account. I was very upset, because I got two over drafts in my bank and cash advance won't help me out to pay for at least one of the over drafts. I will never get another cash advance from them. They've lost my business.",1

YALL MADE MY ACCOUNT OVER DRAFT $110.00‚Ä¶,I am still waiting on my loan that was approved may 15th. Today is the 21st. I have done everything that I was ask to do and still no money Robin Kelly,2
I had to pay my taxes,I‚Äôm giving you a one due to the fact that if you need money on the weekend you need to wait till the next business day. Not good at all specially if you can‚Äôt make it to the facility to pick up you‚Äôre money,2
I got a call from u guys saying the‚Ä¶,This is the second new person and neither one of them was knowledgeable. Had nasty attitude.,1
Unpleasant,The 2 ladies in the office at Chickasha office could be a little nicer and more professional at their workplace! They tend to be very rude when I‚Äôve always paid on time plus they like to talk about other customers when we as customers shouldn‚Äôt have to hear it.,2
I was told if my application went in‚Ä¶,"It is always a problem with the person who treats me in deerfield beach, for me it is a nightmare to go to that place, unfortunately it is the only one that i have nearby, i hope soon not to have to use your services.",2
If you do it on line it takes day to‚Ä¶,"Efficient service but it would be good if you replied to messages.  I have tried numerous times to sign-in to my account but to no avail, & have tried to contact online to complain.  I have called as well but again to no avail I was referred back to online.  I am older, disabled & driving to the center with the pandemic as well causes me to risk my life unnecessarily!  Please I would appreciate a reply, as I take out a loan monthly.",1
Great place,Many problems with online,2
While Advance is a wonderful resource there is room for improvement!,Do not use Advance America for your loan needs. Horrible customer service and they intentionally mislead and misinform you,2
Customer service was Horrendous!!!,Your never helped in this case of the covid 19 I asked for time and never give it,2
i do not like the attitude I get at‚Ä¶,I.m very proud of all the employee in the Advance America very well job they do and very appropriate.,2
Threatened!,This was my 3rd time taking out a loan and it was horrible. Somehow my account number was changed or entered incorrectly to an entire different bank that I‚Äôve never banked with & the money I needed still has not been deposited. Then on top of that they are so called closed on Tuesdays. A normal business day and now I have to wait a whole 5 days to receive my money but it is expected that I pay the loan on time. If it wasn‚Äôt for COVID-19 and being on a strict budget I‚Äôd wouldn‚Äôt take out the loan now. But believe me I‚Äôll never ever take another loan out with Advance America EVER again.,1
Don't bother!,Great customer service and very professional.,1
I love it,I was very disappointed in the online service.. had I went directly to the store I could have had my money 2 days sooner i,1
The online always had issues.,Do not like online requirements or shared info and do not like that you have to agree to privacy policy which will allow sharing. Plan to discontinue doing business with these new requirements.,2

They, most of the time have to put in all the customers info twice. It takes forever to get out/done. Do something about it!!!! This happens every month.",2
Used the online application - horrible experience,"You changed the best check cashing system I ever seen and turned into the worst elrectronic system I ever witnessed, it stinks it's slow, and who ever did would be looking for another job if they worked for me!",1
I WANTED TO HAVE THE LOAN PUT ON MY‚Ä¶,"Your internet were down ! All I can guess are you were scared of all who are now unemployed and have no earnings ! Enjoy your bailouts and tax breaks ,it will end soon !",2
Everything went great,I‚Äôm 71 & would have preferred to handled everything on line. I was forced to go into the store front to re-new the loan. It would have been better to re-new on line also. It would have been so easy to do since you would be working with my debt card.,1
I had to call 4 times trying to get a‚Ä¶,"honestly you are not much more than the thug on the corner, your rates are just as high. 18% for 30 days or  less is not only shady but disrespectful in the eyes  of God.Thing is, we we all be judged in the end and I hope you are right with God.",1
I was approved for a loan on a Sunday‚Ä¶,I have been their quiet a lot and the sign on the window says we‚Äôre open from 9-6 well sometimes I go their at 11 and they have a little clock hanging up in the window that says will return at 1:15 or last week I got their about 2pm and the little clock said will return at 3:15?? Wait- wait- Wait and wait??,1
TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED,"You people are still using paper forms while everyone else is going with email receipts and forms, stop wasting paper and do your part to be more efficient and contribute to save the planet.",1
Their was a mistake made in the‚Ä¶,Not good process was long customer service reprrestantives not helpful,2
If I could give you a ZERO I would,"garbage,   bad business . money the rule of all evil!!!! everything sounds good ain't good!!",1
Seems like every time I apply for them‚Ä¶,My experience has been great. Advance America employees are very professional. They go out their way to try to accommodate your needs.  The online app is so good and easy.,2
Need to move a little faster when‚Ä¶,"The manager at the Eastside Madison WI. Location is very rude.  The amount of money in interest we pay on these loans the least you can do is be respectful, kind, and greatful to customers for our business.",1
Don‚Äôt do it online go in store cause‚Ä¶,I wasn't able to do my loan online. For reasons unknown the submit button would not activate. I left note of this problem and to this date haven't received an answer as to why. So i ended up having to go to your facility anyways..,1
Was approved for an installment online‚Ä¶,The lady's in the store are not very friendly at all they look angry all the time I will not be using that store anymore,2
3:20 pm and no deposit.,"During this time of COVID-19 my wife called to say that she would be late on payment due to being out of work. I am the only one with an income. We haven't been able to pay all the bills, so we were hoping that ADVANCE AMERICA would work with us. The lady at our office is very rude. She said that the night the payment was due that we would have the check automatically processed for the full amount if we did not make payment. We spoke to her boss, he allowed us to make a partial payment. She then kept harassing us for the remaining. My wife told her over and over that we did not have the money but we would call when we did. We've been customers for 3 years. We've always paid them off. Well this morning we woke up to our account overdrawn by 1,000. I would never do business with this heartless company again. Please stay away, businesses show their true colors in the time of crisis!",1
The customer service at this location‚Ä¶,I will be paying my loan off and I won't nothing else to do with y'all. And I definitely will never refer you now. At the beginning I would but when y'all took 1200.00 dollars from in the middle of crisis and I've been laid off because of COVID19. So no after I'm done paying my loan off I WON'T NOTHING ELSE TO DO WITH THIS COMPANY!!!! I will now be homeless because of y'all.,2
I apply for loan on line Friday  june‚Ä¶,Loan approved on line went to store to get money. They complained whole time about online vs store loans.  1 hour later still standing at window finally got money and left.,2
Don't get me wrong the guy at the store‚Ä¶,Told both people in office pay on 3rd.   Large part of their business pays on third  got cash out go over on third they had already run check day before agreed cost $100 in overdraft fees.  THEY DO NOT HOLD TO WORD DO NOT TRUST !!!,1
u approved me and i waited on loan just‚Ä¶,"I've been a customer of Advance America for 7 yrs. They are the best! Never had an issue with them. I was late twice on my loan payment, called and was able to get more time to pay back my loans. I would surely recommend them to others",1
Ever since they Closed Ashland Ohio and‚Ä¶,Horrible experience! Was given the option to deposit my funds directly into my checking account using my debit card because it‚Äôs in there like within 30 minutes! Frances Trudeau is not giving correct information! My UBOC account did not have funds in until the following day!! I therefore was without medication and lost money on overdraft fees! I knew I should have taken the cash but she assured me that ‚Äúeverybody‚Äù always gets their funds within minutes! Just horrible advice from an employee who should know these kind of things! Most definitely will not use this location on Shaw Ave ever again!,1
The new electronic signature document‚Ä¶,Help your customers in this trying time. I understand your a multi million dollar business at least ‚ÄúADVANCE NOT AMERICA ‚Äú waive the monthly fees,2
Advance America is the WORST COMPANY IN THE WORLD!!!,I am very pleased with Advance American. The service is great.,1
Was given the run around for 2 weeks‚Ä¶,"On the 3rd of April I went into the store to pay my loan . the computer system wasslow and not operating correctly. Eight people were waiting to do the same as I was. It took almost an hour to simply pay my loan. There is always an issue in one way or another only one person working computer issues or something else.These are never the fault of the employee behind the counter, but problems on upper management side. I can only wonder why.",1
I wish you offered bigger loan amounts,The manager needs to give customer service. When she is doing you she has to see what the other girl is doing and comment on her or her customer. Which takes longer for you to get yours done. The other girl had three people done to Diane doing me. Diane takes longer cause she has to know everything going on. Which is rude to me.,2
You deposited my money into an account‚Ä¶,The girl who works in the office on Dixie Highway - not friendly AT ALL.  No communication (only what she has to say) just plain bland!! Smh,1
Workers should know what they‚Äôre making u sign,I had been trying to get in my account several times and I could not so what's the Problem,2
Stick to in person forget on line!,"Bad communication and took too long for the money to deposit in my account, I would have rather picked it up in person, if it wasn‚Äôt For the Covid 19 situation.",2
Sorry Company,"Waiting days later to renew hurts more than it helps. Can't understand why this helps, what would help is to lessen fees. Who thought of this method?",1
I don‚Äôt see how this is legal,I guess I expected a little more as I built credit with this company.,1
You are truly an awesome an wonderful‚Ä¶,"I made payments on time.I got a notice from bank of nsfc dated for the same day I got paid,and went into local office to pay my account. Nothing was mentioned to me about this,later,on,the next week,I was asked  about an upcoming payment,when the employee  at advance knew from day 1 that I get paid biweekly. Now two nsfc has been submitted to my account. .yea thanks a lot advance america.",2
Your website is not good,"All of the workers are extremely nice and do an amazing job! The problem I have, which I believe is huge, is that this a payday advance store. I do not understand why you cannot get cash! That is the reason your there. I have to get a check, which then costs me $7.00 to cash which is beyond rediculous! The whole purpose of coming to your store is because I need cash! I have to pay to receive the cash, then I have to pay to cash a check. No other cash advance business is run this way. I honestly use every other cash advance store any time I can other then Advance America because of this issue. This really needs to be reviewed and fixed. On a very lucky day when I come in, they do have cash because I was lucky enough someone came in to pay back a loan. This is a serious problem! I hear many people talk about this issue and how they refuse to come to your business. You are losing customers!  Customers shouldn‚Äôt have to receive a check when you advertise you are a payday loan business and people can receive $445.00 CASH!  Even if you get a card, you are limited to what you can take off at a time AND you have to PAY for that as well! I do believe this is false advertising!!",2
I don't get it I been paying for 4‚Ä¶,"The ladies at my local Advance America are great, but as customer who pays on time monthly Advance American is so far behind in helping people during the Covid-19 outbreak.Only creditor that did not offer to help. Advance America is so far behind others in their industry. Sad!PS: Nice sign in office ""Your Not Just A Loan To Us"" (paraphrased!) - Well, I found out I'm just a loan!",1
Why I Gave y‚Äôall one star I have‚Ä¶,"I needed cash, after all the process they told me they can only do $200 in cash the rest has to be in a card. Basically they forced me the use their card.",1
Another change of policy that required‚Ä¶,I don't like that you have to wait about 5 days to renew a loan online,2
Your new system is great,"I no longer have an open acct. with this co. & never will again. I've tried to maintain a positive relationship with them but they've made it more than difficult. They're so hillbilly that they made a feeble attempt at going online claiming to improve the process. I decided to test it to see how it works. They were able to take my payment with zero issues. But when it came time to reloan as I was told I'd be able to do, 4 days later no money showed up in my account. The system said if you did it before 10:30 AM you'd get it the same day. I got the ""you're approved pending"" notice on line, did it between 6 & 7 AM so I should've had the money right? NO money ever showed in my acct. & no 1 contacted me to say there was a problem. I had to call the store to find out when they did their conversion, they transferred acct. #s that were no longer valid & other outdated info. But for some reason didn't have any of the info the store had in a file almost 2 reams of paper thick! There should be laws against harboring customer info! I was horrified by the amount of $ I'd paid over the yrs. How's it possible that you can't transfer info entered in your system repeatedly on a bi-weekly basis when you do a conversion? What is wrong with this picture? Certainly isn't the customers fault! I was made to believe it was! This co. is way too hillbilly & can't seem to figure out their own systems. I was told when I called the store that there was no loan present, they tried to credit closed accts. & 1 I didn't recognize without ever contacting me - the customer - to clarify the info & figure out what the problem was! This is not a co. that focuses on or perfected customer service. They just shut down when there's a problem without picking up a phone or sending email communication to request you contact them to resolve them. What is that all about? It's called incompetence at its finest! I got into a bit of a tiff with the store manager, for which I'm sorry because it's not her fault & I like her, but I'm angery about how poorly this co. handles its business. Technically it's not the stores fault. I love the people there & will miss them. But that was the very last straw for me with this co. They've just made too many errs. I was in the hospital because I had emergency surgery in 2018. I called when I was able to let them know I was still admitted & couldn't leave until the dr. released me. They wobbled on giving me an extension! I'm in the hospital & you can't extend an on time, long term customer a small courtesy outside of your boxed in thinking & whack policies? Really? I was mad then & still am! I paid them off with that crack pot online system recently, replaced them 4 days later with another more up to date co. that doesn't have ridiculous policies & isn't so greedy they keep you trapped in loans that deplete your income by $90 every mo. for a $300 loan that's only $255 anyway, but you still have to pay $300, that is open to extensions when/where needed with far, far better customer service & smarter employees! I was looking for a way to pay them off & get rid of that payday loan trap. They just made it happen 20 times faster. They suck & I say find another co. who has online mastered. I could name off quite a few co.'s I've had great experiences with in the past but I know that's not allowed. So AA should consider themselves lucky! If I could single handily destroy their business I would! What I can do is write the CA Dept. of Business Oversight, the CA Atty. General & CA Governor to report the issues I've had with them. I'll support the pending bill to end the payday loans in CA to get these hard money lenders out of our state by writing my Senators for keeping hard working American's pockets empty by taking advantage of us. The $90 a month you pay them thereby traps you in a debt that's extremely hard to get out of & isn't worth it! Figure it out, pay them off & report them to the state govt. to end their reign of greed!",1
Imagine Advance America is your buddy‚Ä¶,"well rigt now people is not working and this company is not flexible with the time, i hope they understand the situation, and give more time to the people to repay the loans they have.",2
Everytime I try to log in ...it won't‚Ä¶,"I had a horrible experience.  It took 45 mins to get a loan. Half way through the process,  the clerk (Jeff) asked me to step outside because he had to use the restroom. I waited 25 mins outside while he used the restroom.  I couldn't leave because my id was sitting on the counter. I will be doing everything online from now on.",1
Great customer service,"The manager located at East Ave J in Lancaster CA was very rude and unprofessional with me. I needed to pay back a loan and take out another loan so the clerk that was assisting me went to ask the manager about my account. When the clerk returned with the manager the manager stated "" you stormed out of here last week so we couldn't help you!""  I had no idea of she was talking about? I told her that ""I didn't want to argue and that I just wanted to take out a loan.""  I have used your services previously and have always paid back loans.  But I will discontinue using services with unprofessional employees or managers like her...",2
The girl at the counter was very‚Ä¶,The associated are rude to the customers over the phone and in person,1
My honest opinion,I am always approved for more at home on my computer than I am allowed to borrow in the marianna fl office. If I go to a different office will the same thing happen or will I be given what the website approves me for at home?,1
My regular office I pay on my account‚Ä¶,"I had a Stacy help me in Papillion, Ne.She is so, so, rude. I had leaned over the counter to give her my check. She looked at me with a very angry face and said don't lean over my counter. Stacy said you don't do that at the bank do you. I have had other people tell me how horrible she is. I didn't believe them until this happened. She should be fired. I have been in sales all my life, never would I ever treat anyone like she did. You are definately losing business.",2
Very professional,"I would have left 5 stars if the two weeks till my next check was actually two weeks before they took the money. So if you get paid every two weeks, and you chose to apply online, you get the money and everything is great, except they will take the money out of your bank the day BEFORE you get paid. So beware because you end up paying bank fees because they take the money out the day before the two weeks.",2
Okay,"Not happy with such a short one week time to repay.  I‚Äôve requested that this be extended to the following payday (which was the expected day day), but have received no reply.  Disappointed.",1
You guys usually do a 5 star but this‚Ä¶,I have been a loyal customer for a while now because of the ease and no stress way of doing business that you offer.,2
Educate your phone people,"I dont like the fact that I was told I would be declined the next time I need a loan by your manager in the Livingston,Tx office. I will not be back there and will go somewhere else. And the way she talks to your clients is very rude, she is loud and very obnoxious to people. Not very professional at all.",1
I am still waiting on my loan that was‚Ä¶,wasn't informed of the three time roll over had to pay cash b 4 she would rewrite new loan,1
I‚Äôm giving you a one due to the fact‚Ä¶,The company switched to online services and now they take your money out before your paycheck even clears!! Horrible services and the manager wasn‚Äôt helpful at all!!!,1
