Lendio was not getting the loan done,"Lendio was not getting the loan done. Luckily the actual bank that was doing the loan called us and we were able to get it done in spite of Lendio. We kept sedning the same documents to Lendio and when the actual bank called they had not received what they needed from the documents we sent to Lendio. They DID NOT put us in touch with the bank, the bank called us when we were almost past the deadline, thank God for the bank. Lendio not so much we almost lost our money.",2
It was very difficult to get a response…,"It was very difficult to get a response from my ""dedicated"" agent. Additionally, my agent was switched multiple times throughout the process. Lastly, I was asked by multiple people to send additional information that was never uploaded to the portal. Therefore, weeks had past and I was told I had to submit the same documents I submitted to my agents multiple times. Communication could be much better.",2
I still have not received funds,I still have not received funds. Please Help!!!Thank you for your response and I trust you are correct about funds but can you tell me why my approval date keeps getting pushed back? I signed the first approved contact on 3/22 then another on 4/16. Now you are saying I was approved on 4/27. Are you sure I will be receiving funds soon? I have a project I just won and need this funding for payroll. Please advise.,1
Lendio gets 2 stars for getting my PPP…,"Lendio gets 2 stars for getting my PPP loan finally funded, but that is it.  This was a long, slow, repetitive process, and I was funded 75 days later than I expected.  Ready Capital ALSO gets a 2 star rating for making me sign the same documents 3 times.I can only hope that the PPP forgiveness will be MUCH easier, and if it is, I'd be happy to change this to 3 or 4 starts.",2
"Horrible Experience, Don't Waste Your Time","I submitted my application in January, was passed back and forth between different ""account managers"" for weeks without making any progress and am now supposedly under review with the management but have heard nothing back. Still no funding when I completely qualify for PPP, four months later.  Zero concern or correspondence from the staff at Lendio. Find another provider.",1
Horrible experience to receive one round of PPP funds,"Way too long to receive any assistance, unresponsive, horrible experience to receive one round of PPP fundsI'm now aware I wasn't the only one who had to fight and email and constantly hound the funding managers to get funded. I had to submit the same documents again and again. For another friend using Lendio, they left her hanging. She couldn't even withdraw her application to try and get help else. Terrible, terrible service!",1
LENDIO NOT SO GREAT!,I thought Lendio was gonna be a great company. But as of right now. No. They have me all messed up with the SBA I can't even get my second ppp loan. And I can't get help from anyone. So thanks slot Lendio. If I wanted this many problems I would have done it myself.I'm referring to the first ppp loan last year. And I don't know who I'm going thru this year.,2
If late or no responses are not an…,"If late or no responses are not an issue, customer service of no importance and replies to your inquires not relevant, if online system can be glitchy, look no further. I applied for 1st draw of PPP, system forced me to sign everything every time I logged in. SBA loan # is incorrect. Second draw PPP can't be initiated. Customer service nowhere to be found. They changed my funding manager name and contact information over dozen times.",1
Poor Customer Service:,"Poor Customer Service:Although we received the loan, we had a very difficult time reaching our rep, whether via phone, text, or email, sometimes taking over a week to respond to us, or not responding at all. We tried reaching out to Lendio directly using their provided contact information, but had no better luck. Our case was handed over to another rep who was no more responsive.  We will use another company for our second draw loan.",2
The point person I had for my PPP loan…,The point person I had for my PPP loan through lendio was very difficult to work with. He was demeaning and didn’t make any effort to get back to me. He was consistently rude and yelled at me once on the phone. It was a terrible experience working with this individual. Not sure if he only works for lendio but it affected my experience with lendio for my PPP.,2
Wrong amount reported to the SBA,This was explained multiple times to Lendio and Texas National Bank. There are two schedule C filed for 2020. One for my wife and one for myself. My wife started her business in late 2020. The amount request was from my wife's schedule C. Not only was this for a smaller amount but I am sure that it was not legal to submit her schedule C for a PPP grant. Can someone please explain to me why underwriting for this application was incorrectly done? Both at Lendio and at Texas National bank.,1
one more time back to Lendio and like I…,"one more time back to Lendio and like I said before is very hard to talk someone and online they just say wait and as now I don't know if my application is fill out fine  for the 2nd round, if  it's  complete or need more paper work ., I submit my application on 4/17/2021 I chat with someone on 4/20/21 I was told somebody will call me until now I'm waiting",2
Lendio does everything but Lend,"Lendio is run by a bunch of “yes” persons. They tell you what you want to hear, but actually don’t do a thing. They promptly answer the phone with their first tier support, but never resolve your issues. I tried working with them for a PPP loan. After three months I contacted Blue Acorn and got funded within two weeks. Additionally, every time I checked my account a new person was in charge of it. Do not trust your money, loans, or any financial help with Lendio.",1
Process was very very slow-they…,Process was very very slow-they referredAnother bank to fund And they had no funds and another one they referred was unable to verify bank account-after doing a little research that had happened with a lot of people who were referredTo smart biz. Never received any funding they them and they were very slow to respond to any correspondence,1
It's the worst company I've ever had in…,"It's the worst company I've ever had in America. The company delayed my loan application for four months, changing managers, and now handed it over to a partner company. I am really disappointed that there are still companies that do this kind of service.If you want a business loan, contact your bank or other lender. I never recommend this company.",1
Lendio has not met any of my…,"Lendio has not met any of my expectations. I was due funding on 6/10/21, I’ve been working with Lendio without success. My loan was approved and funded by the SBA, and Offered by Texas National Bank, and not Funded due to Lendio’s negligence. It’s now been more than a month, my business line was disconnected, my business lease is going to be terminated, I’ve yet to meet some of my own customer expectations and Lendio has not communicated anything aside from we are working on it o  lo",1
We began our application in February of…,"We began our application in February of 2021. It took 3 months to finalize the whole process. It was almost impossible to get touch with anyone via phone or via email to ask any questions. Also our account Mr. Smith got v frustrated so many times over the fact that he had to send the same requested documents several times It seems that we had at least 4 different representatives ,if not more ,who were involved with this process. We are glad that finally it’s over!!",2
Proceed with extreme caution,"If I could give zero stars, I would.  This was a painful, lengthy process with poor to no follow-up at all when questions arose.  I had to send documents more than once, as well as explain that they already had the documents they were waiting for.  One chat rep actually told me to ""wait my turn like everyone else"" when I asked her what was causing the delay.  It appears that Lendio was ill-prepared for the influx of applications. Disappointing and frustrating experience.",1
Lendio was horrible to work with they…,Lendio was horrible to work with they kept asking for information and documents that had been submitted multiple times. Each week a different account manager was assigned to me but I could never get any clear information or answers out of any of them. Liftfund should have never hired them as a third-party to process PPL loans..After 4 1/2 frustrating months working with lendio liftfund ended up processing my file and getting me my PPP loan. I would rank lendio a big fat zero!!,1
Still waiting on disbursement for loan…,"Still waiting on disbursement for loan that was submitted on Feb 16th with Lendio and the note with the lender (Benworth Capital) which was signed on May 10th.   It is a shame that loan process is taking so long and there is not any viable option to escalate, including with SBA.  Definitely a zero star experience so far!",1
Horrible!!!!!!!,Horrible!!!!!!!! I was never helped and ended up losing the opportunity to get the SBA loan I was verified for due to incompetence.YES I was approved but for 3x less then I was verified.  We lost over 100k access to funds we can never receive bc the last of communication from Lendio and Ready Capital.  It was a nightmare.,1
DO NOT USE LENDIO!,"DO NOT USE LENDIO!! I applied for a PPP loan 3 months ago. They have continually asked for all sorts of things, including my bank account username and password. I finally received the social security card in the mail that they made me order, and now they're not giving me a way to upload it to them. Everyone I work with received their SBA decision in 3 days from other lenders, I have been waiting 3 months, still nothing. I should have applied somewhere else. I am disgusted with lendio!!",1
Would not recommend Lendio,"Would not recommend Lendio. Applied in January for PPP loan. Received loan documents from four different lenders. Kept being told everything looked good no need for more information just stay patient. Did not receive funding. Terrible customer service, funding managers not responsive and can't help you. Stay away!",1
Disappointing lack of coordination…,"Disappointing lack of coordination between all those I interacted with at lendio. I submitted requested documenting 5+ times, each time being told that I was all set and nothing more was needed. Then, when I would log back in, it would say that I needed to resubmit my application. Overall, a very frustrating experience.",2
Avoid them if possible,"I was approved for and received my loan, that is the only reason for 2 vs 1 star. Both the funding manager and the individual I was working with dropped out of contact and would not answer phone calls, text messages, or emails. The only way that I was able to contact anyone was by posting a message on their Facebook wall asking why nobody has contacted me. Minimal steps were taken to give any additional information. The only helpful individual was from Ready Capital. Would not recommend Lendio.",2
EXTREMELY difficult to get feedback and…,EXTREMELY difficult to get feedback and help from LendioCommunications very poor from LendioNumerous staff involved therefore no consistency with the correspondence and requests Small business owner should never  encounter the level ofdifficulty this presented..Very thankful this loan process has been completed,2
PPP Loan experience,"Tried applying for the PPP loan. It was an extremely easy process that became very difficult. I wasted so much of my time trying to get this loan, I don't even want to put time into this review. After 20+ phone calls, 90 emails, and a solid month waiting to get approved I don't think I'll ever work together with Lendio ever again. Other people I know that applied for the PPP loan received approval in days. This whole process was extremely time consuming and their customer service was no help at all.",1
Horrible and fishy,Took all my personal information and sat on it for months. Never made any attempt to help me or get ppp application. Used another party and was done within a week. Pretty shady and horrible; seems like they were just taking my information to resale to 3rd party? May karma return the favor lendio.,1
Could not have been a worse experience,Could not have been a worse experience. Absolutely inept staff that made the whole process a complete nightmare and also made me not be able to apply for 2nd draw due to how slowly they processed my first. So saddened by whole thing as I desperately was relying on these funds to keep my small biz afloat.,1
Too bad Beth Pratt won’t answer my…,Too bad Beth Pratt won’t answer my emails asking why I got a generic email saying I applied for my PPP loan too late (the application was filed in February) and there were no funds reserved for my business.  I would not ever recommend this company. They completely let me down when I needed them most,1
Do not use Lendio for PPP,"Do not use Lendio for PPP, they will pass you around to (no kidding) 8 different lending managers (none of which communicated with the previous one), wait until the last minute to get you funding. Tell you that you are funded, then go back and say you missed paperwork which is already in the system, then tell you that you have missed the deadline for funding, AFTER the bank has directly notified you that you will receive funding. Totally unorganized, no real accountability. The fact we were able to get funded was a mere dice roll.",1
This last two months has been a journey…,"This last two months has been a journey dealing with Lendio and Ready Capital. They actually came through.... I want to say thank you and I’m glad this process is over, if you started with them be patient, a little more patient than I was, your money is coming they do an alright job. Thank you guys again",2
Worst Lending Brokers,"This is the Worst Lending company , Do not waste your time please , They run credit 3 times for no reason , approved signed documents and never funded , I want my contract cancelled and send  back the representative  is Hiding behind his Meeting Blanket , Won't reply .Text me that  in Past I reduced payments and defaulted with other lenders which is complete lie , Now they admit that they made up the story, Because I have letters from all lenders These guys are laughing stock and Shame on Lending business. if you want to see any email or text message. Just avoid them, there are million brokers better than these Jokers. RUNThere is nothing this TRUST PILOT IS TRUST WORTHY THEY WANT ME TO CHANGE MY COMMENTS TO SERVE THEIR MASTERS WHO PAY THEM.",1
ReadyCapital/Lendio Grossly Incompetent,"Your selection of ReadyCapital was not a good one.  Due to their poor communication (read: ignored), I am told funding has now been exhausted for my second draw.  That has a major financial impact for me.  RC should never again be recommended by Lendio.  They are incompetent at best.  If legal action were within my capabilities, I would file against RC and possibly you.  Frustrated beyond.  THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO LENDIO’S COMMENT - YOUR INACTION RELATES TO MY SECOND DRAW.  PLEASE CONTACT ME - YOU HAVE MY INFORMATION.",1
If i could give them negative stars i…,If i could give them negative stars i would i applied for a loan in january 2021 and couldn’t  get funded by may 2021. It was always update this document or that document and that loan officers are reviewing your documents please do yourself a favor and look elsewhere this company is a joke!,1
My experience wasn’t the best,"My experience wasn’t the best, I still haven’t heard anything regarding my other application. Just one application was completed.  But I have been contacting Smartbiz  several times. I haven’t received an email or call. Its just unprofessional I don’t understand why no one has contacted me.",2
Non-transparent and petty,"Lendio after me requesting information on my business loan sent me an email with an outline of that loans said terms and conditions. Bluevine after requesting the initial draw Sent me another set of terms and conditions that were not agreeable because of that we requested the line of credit be closed, and due to the fact of not having all information prior to the first draw we felt it fair not to be charged any of the fees. Bluevine has refused to waive the charges that were incurred as we returned the money on the same day as we receivied it Lendio has not offered any resolution and they are the ones who procured the loan these companies are not transparent and both companies representatives stated that the transaction should have not happened in that manner i having all supporting documents in a timeline outlining the chain of events",1
HI- my PPP loan as submitted as a…,"HI- my PPP loan as submitted as a second draw instead of a 1st draw. I tried correcting many times by revising the Lendio portal, calling Lendio customer service and addressing with my Lendio representative. Although I was promised several times, by lendio, that my application was corrected in-house to be a 1st draw...my PPP loan ended up being processing as a 2nd draw. Now I am trying to correct the loan to 1st draw so I can apply for the 2nd draw & I am concerned I am running out of time to correct application to 1st draw.",2
I’ll give “0” star if I could,"I’ll give “0” star is I could Terrible customer service, phone calls and emails go unanswered. Was promised certain amount, got not even half of it. They didn’t care to review it.Took longer than 4 months, even though they said it would take 2 weeksWould never, ever use these people again",1
Lendio is a unprofessional company with…,Lendio is a unprofessional company with absolutely NO answers to any questions that are important.They don't answer their phone.They'll call you back and tell you a whole bunch of nothing in a nice voice and leave you more lost than you were before they called.IF YOU SEE LENDIO RUN!!!,1
They made me sign my PPP 1st round loan…,"They made me sign my PPP 1st round loan docs 4 times. Finally, I got funded back in Feb. Months later, I tried applying to the second round PPP in May but i couldnt move fwd because Lendio still has my application on funding stage from the 1st round and cannot move fwd with the second round.",1
Raise for the commission!!!,Loan officers or Loan managers are persistent to get your loan but once you’re on the que they don’t know how to return your inquiry. They just want the numbers that they were able to include you in their roster…….. a rat race so to speak.These officers don’t listen to you!!!,1
Didn’t help Seasonal Business,Unfortunately I wasn’t able to get a bigger loan due to my business being seasonal.  I messaged the person and left voice messages who first originally was helping with my loan but never replied back to adjust the loan.  Instead I just had to submit the loan amount which was almost 50% less than what I would have received if the adjuster or even the online platform was able to figure this issue out.   Can’t really complain about the PPP loan but the 2nd loan was considerably less than my first loan and there was nothing your company did about it.,2
Awful experience,"Awful experience.  They solicited loans for the latest PPP2 program.  Our application was approved and an SBA# was assigned in early March.  Today is June 11th and we have not received any funding or documentation.  Nobody at Lendio is responsive other than ""we're following up"" or ""we're escalating"".  When I escalated it myself to Denada Ramnishta, their SVP or Lending, I get no response despite three seperate emails to her.  Unconscionable how little concern they seem to have for the customer.  Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT use this firm.",1
Help thru the Pandemic,"We really appreciate the work Lendio put into our loan application and funding process.  My application stagnated for two months till a second advisor was assigned and noticed I had checked first draw rather than second draw.  I was under the impression this was a totally new program (my error)  I immediately reapplied changing the info to second draw, added a few more items of information and the actual lender was quick to fund us the PPP-2 money to our Bank.  Again we appreciate the work done but I want to be honest in my comments also.",2
The process was difficult with multiple…,"The process was difficult with multiple emails and texts. In addition, my business partner completed the paperwork yet I received the forms which were filled by him. In the end, to get our funding we were receiving multiple emails with deadlines when we had not received any emails.",2
Worst service ever,"Worst service ever.  I applied on day one the portal was opened.  3 months of waiting and numerous of hours on the phone and chat with Lendio agent, whole process was nothing but nightmare.  Lendio and lending partner, Ready Capital made mistake with PLP caused unnecessary months of delay.  My application got mixed up with someone else's.  Couldn't pass the validation because of ""ghost applicant"" on my application. Either Lendio or Ready Capital helped with making necessary correction.   As a result of I lost the opportunity to apply for second draw.",1
Poor Communication,"It took me three different conversations with customer service reps to learn that, after Lendio passed my loan application to Ready Capital, I had to reapply using Ready Capital's online application. Why did nobody inform me of that? My application sat there for over a month with no action because nobody could remember to tell me that I needed to reapply. The first two reps I talked to told me my application was complete and that I just needed to wait. They were wrong. The third rep finally told me what I needed to do and my loan was funded within a week or two.",1
Unfortunately,"Unfortunately, Lendio didn't give me a proper answer each time I asked about my loan status. even I signed an application. They ignore that one and make me wait about 3 weeks, and then sent me to another company to do the loan work from scratch. It was so confusing!!!",2
"Great Lendio representative, but handed over to terrible lender.","The representative that handled my account was excellent. Your software used to interface with the net and collect the needed data was very good. After all requirements were met, it took a long time to connect with a lender, maybe this was out of your control.  I signed the SGA loan documents provided by the lender, and the 72 hour funding process took over a month and only after I threatened to contact the SBA.  Your representative stated that Lendio could do nothing to help.  The service was poor, because you chose a bad lender, and said you could do nothing to help.",2
Relentless spamming & phony practices,"Lendio facilitated my first PPP loan through two different bank-ish entities. However, their sketchy form texts and emails that don't appear to be from breathing humans, as well as relentless spamming (sending emails every single day), is terrible business practice.",2
Unfortunately I'm sorry to say that…,Unfortunately I'm sorry to say that Lendeo was more than a joke to work with they bounced me around to six or seven different people although I was qualified for a loan double the amount I ended up being forced to take the loan and half the amount because after weeks of getting a DocuSign in the incorrect amount funds were running out.   They had very poor communication with their third party lender ready capital.  I was told by Linda they put seven tickets in to fix the loan amount but it never was fixed I'm grateful that I did get the loan however I was entitled to double what I got.,1
Bad experience,My first loan was canceled after a tortious period of requiring more and more info after being told I was  approved multiple time and lack of responisve communication.  The rating would have been a zero if u had not found a second lender that ultimately funded,2
Terrible customer service,Terrible customer service! They don’t care about people at all and useless!More than one month waiting for response and actions with current applicant and all done paperwork!Never start with them! Founding members are sleepy and useless!Very disappointed!,1
If I could leave a negative 5 stars I…,If I could leave a negative 5 stars I would!! Dealing with Lendio has been the BIGGEST WASTE OF TIME! I submitted my application for the PPP loan in February when the second round began. They asked for the same documents repeatedly asked the same questions I had already answered again and again. My application had said “sent to the SBA” for months and I’m guessing was never actually sent. There is nobody to call and discuss issues with and nothing gets done apparently. Time for funding ran out and they didn’t get my application to the SBA in time. Thanks for nothing Lendio. Awful awful experience!!!!!!,1
My PPP thru Lendio took 3 months,"My PPP thru Lendio took 3 months. Many glitches unable to talk to actual person was the reason. After many emails and finally to Speaking to their VP of operation, I was able to get my PPP loan. This could’ve been simpler with actual loan officer in person.",2
BEWARE OF LENDIO!,"my first experience seemed to go well.  went i went back to the lendio well for additional financing, sadly i was relegated to a so called 'renewals manager'.  it turns out that he simply slings loans and doesnt disclose material deal points, which could (and has) materially affected our business.  no manager skills and instead a salesman who could care less. not only did he lie and misrepresent, he refuses to take responsibility; instead he hides and is non responsive.  very slimy & and very. unprofessional. ATTENTION:  read everything and dont rely on a Lendio rep to tell the truth, THEY DONT.  they're brokers pushing you into products they either dont know about, and dont care about the outcome  - or your well being after you sign.  there are other, more honest and transparent, brokers out there.   BE CAREFUL WITH LENDIO.",1
They were so confused during my…,"They were so confused during my paycheck protection program loan, they didnt know what was needed or who it would go to.... Then, the program ended. After hours and hours of work to get it submitted well before the deadline, i was told the program ended and Im just S$*t out of luck. Way to go LendidoEdit after reply; I have two businesses and applied for the paycheck protection program in both. Lendido merged them together and only one of my businesses actually got funded. I guess my other business is just out of luck. Just like the pandemic, through no fault of my own, Lendido will make my business go under.",1
Lendio was clueless to the knowledge of…,Lendio was clueless to the knowledge of what was happen with my loan. In fact I was told I was not approved and was not getting funded. I think some of the representatives were ok but overall worst company— I should’ve been funded months ago.,1
I reached out to Lendio for help with…,"I reached out to Lendio for help with the PPP loan, and was pleased with the results that I received. Lendio stuck with me every step of the way and I received the funds that I requested. Definitely needed, and definitely appreciated. Thank you Lendio.",1
Limitations on PPP loan application,The Lendio PPP loan application limited applicants to using 2019 or 2020 to calculate their second draw loan in 2021 and did not include the third option available under SBA/PPP rules of the 12-month period before the loan is issued.  Our organization would have been able to receive a larger loan (and those extra dollars would have really helped!) if Lendio had allowed that option on their application.  One technical recommendation: The upload options could also be improved to allow applicants to label and categorize each document -- that might have helped with the delays in the loan review process on the backend.,2
The reason for the 2nd star is I did…,The reason for the 2nd star is I did get funded and someone made the effort to reach out and explain why the experience was so disjointed. I imagine the volume was very high but by far this experience was the worst I’ve ever experienced as a customer.,2
The process took way longer than it…,The process took way longer than it should and the partners Lendio uses (Ready Capital) are the worst. No one was ever available and the Lendio representative wasn't able to help either. WORST experience I ever had and I am not using them EVER again.,1
Lendio seemed nice enough until on Feb…,"Lendio seemed nice enough until on Feb 23 2022 an agent let me know that the 5% interest rate amortizes monthly not annually. That’s essentially the equivalent of a 40% interest rate! I’m much better off using a credit card. I was glad that he warned me, so I told him to cancel the funding which he assured me was the case on a recorded call. Just yesterday March 8th I got a congratulatory email on my new credit line. Sure enough it wasn’t cancelled out like they told me on recording. I’ve reached out multiple times via call and email, but nothing but crickets from them. Be warned! Only leaving this review because they just sent me an email with this link asking me to leave a review, and have yet to actually address my concern.",1
No follow-up...waste of time.,All Lendio was able to do for me was get my business small line of credit for $50k at 48%APR. The person I was working with told me they were going to work on getting me an SBA or other loan but I never heard back.,1
The loan process with Lendio was…,"The loan process with Lendio was challenging, but not from a qualification standpoint.  What made the process difficult was the repeated requests for the same items from several different people, or from the same person multiple times, and that none documents sent were ever processed.  Everyone was courteous in their communication, but we were left with this overarching sense that the team at Lendio didn't have a handle on what they were doing.  After an agonizing amount of back and forth the loan was eventually funded, for which we are grateful, but based on this experience I doubt we would choose to do business with Lendio again.",2
Horrible Experience,Horrible Experience! Unless something changes this company is doomed! No calls back ever?  No customer service help?Asked to resubmit documents they lost more than once. No good structure in the process Sorry guys! Only reason I had to use them was because American Express did our company’s first PPP and they chose lendio to handle their customers second PPP.  American Express management even told me it was a bad decision on there part.  And they were getting a ton of complaints on lendio.  This is my experience with Lendio.  Do your own research. I would of never choose them knowing what I know now for the loan!Good luck,1
I contacted Lendio because I needed a…,"I contacted Lendio because I needed a loan due to some late payments by clients. They offered to help but I didn't realize that they were going to connect me with a predatory lending company called Capital Expansion Group. The Lendio rep (Anthony) explained the loan but I believe he purposefully left out information to make it seem better than it was. It turned out that regardless of when I pay off the loan I still owed a huge fee. He didn't tell me how much this fee was. Be very careful with Lendio and have your lawyer review the contracts because after this horrible experience I talked to my lawyer and he said ""That is a classic predatory lending company.""",1
Had to send in the documents way to…,Some guy called to ask me to bump my review up a “star or two”. He was nice at first then started cutting me off. Totally rude. For that reason i will keep it at one star. Site is also difficult. Tiffany is amazing. She is five stars.,1
I went with Lendio because…,"I went with Lendio because recommendation by insurance company. I finalized my paperwork with Lendio by Jan 21 2021. Starting from February and until mid of April I was calling Lendio on a weekly basis to follow up with status of my application. I had several account managers assigned to my application through out the process. None of them were responsive. Numerous calls and emails to them did not help. More than that, at certain time Lendio introduced 2 factor authentication (good), but your technical support was not helpful either. Even though I received my PPP loan eventually in a middle of May 2021, general experience with Lendio was not good at all.",1
Far too long,"Far too longIt took months for Lendio to get their act together to then send us to a lender who said we didn't meet the criteria, but refused to tell us how we didn't meet the criteria. I would never use Lendio again for anything.",1
Lendio was very great the first round,"Lendio was very great the first round, however the second round they didn't follow up with me and I was constantly asking for help. Reluctantly  I would get some generic answers.  I was told that I would be able to get the loan for the same amount as the first. However with Lendio's lack of help I received approximately $4500.00 less than the first round, and that extra money I was really counting on.  Yes the money that I received I am very grateful for, but because of Lendio's lack of help I'm behind again because I couldn't fulfill the obligations that I told people relying on what Lendio's ""great team"" told me.   Thank you Lendio for your lack of help.",1
Started well ending very badly unfortunately,"Lendio s application process and database were easy to use and follow unfortunately due to a transposed account number error on there end I have yet to be funded. I’ve been trying to get this resolved since June 10th, reaching out to customer service and funding Manager. Customer service was no help for the first few calls I made and the funding manager has completely ignored My requests (3). Twice I’ve been told this would be forwarded to a team lead and yet I received  no follow up or resolution.  Im disappointed what seemed to have been a good start is going to end badly as I yet to be funded and Im going to likely loose my business property lease. Thanks Lendio.",1
Getting my PPP loan through Lendio was… absolutely horrible!,"Getting my PPP loan through Lendio was HORRIBLE! It took more than 2 months. I know the second one takes longer but I had everything all prepared ahead of time. Everything submitted within the first week. Over and over again was told they reviewed it and I’d get less money and less money. This took more than two months. If I had questions or needed to know what was taking so long there was NO ONE to answer anything!

Communication was terrible,"Communication was terrible. I used Lendio for my PPP loan process and the agents I had were terrible with communicating with me. They say there was missing documentation but when I reached out to the many different Funding managers, none of them would respond to tell me what documents were missing. I’d get calls from different agents with messages about how a contract was “sent” but funnily enough, there is no record of any contracts being sent to my emails. They just “disappeared” into cyber space I guess. Funny how that works. I missed out on my opportunity at getting a loan for my business because of the slow responses from my agents as well as lack of communication. I would not recommend.",1

But the second round process took well over 3 months to close!!  They NEVER returned any of my calls, the representative assigned to our file was extremely rude and demanding.  I would NOT recommend them for any SBA loan.  They are really good with taking all the information, but terrible with follow up.  Their supposed 'real-time' website was never updated and accurate with our status.  I certainly can go on and on, but suffice it to say, we were not satisfied with the service we received from them.  If/when there's a next time, we will find another lender.",1

I got an email a month ago saying my application was approved and I'd be hearing from someone about my loan details. You know what I heard? From another Lendio loan officer today that I needed to RESIGN my application! Again!! And I just heard from another bank (since I'm tired of the run around) that the funds are all gone and the round is closed! WHAT THE HECK!! This company is a joke. So extremely disappointed.",1

We are continuously told the information will not suffice and cannot seem to get around them. they refuse to send the information to the SBA and do not provide clear details on how to. I have work with dozens of banks and have gotten over $25million forgiven and this is the only bank I have had issues getting through to.",1

Horrible response time and loan processing,"Company needs major improvement in their manual loan processing protocols.While it is true the company assisted in both rounds of PPP, it was definitely not a smooth or easy process. Getting my loans approved required over 15 trouble tickets, escalation to corporate level individuals, waiting for days for a response that did not solve or even address the issue,, contacting the direct lender myself, contacting the SBA, pointing out critical errors, demanding the critical errors be corrected, and regular follow up. It was VERY VERY VERY stressful and not what one would expect when employing a loan SERVICER. In the end I ended up working with the direct lender and servicing my own loan. I would only return to lendio out of pure desperation.",1

So after 4 months of trying to get correct funds I recieved 1,400.  I know I should be thankful I got any money but when someone tells you your approved for 13k and you only get 1,400 it’s quite disappointing. During this process I emailed called texted everyone who was assigned to my case and tried dealing directly with ready capital who was the lender and that was even more frustrations. So over all very unsatisfied with the service I recieved.",1

I had submitted my applications 3 months before I got any type of clear understanding to what else they needed. I had to continuously ask what was needed instead of Lendio updating me on extra information they would need. I was in limbo for a long time. At the end I reached someone that actually was quitting the next day, but he was the most helpful person I had dealt with. Finally a week before I got funding I spoke with a gentleman that actually communicated what was going on and got back with me right away with any questions. I’m only giving stars because of those two people and finally getting funding almost 6 months later.",2

They have no idea what they're doing,"Not only did the person assigned to my application keep changing, but the bank that was supposed to be handling the application also changed. To add insult to injury by the third counselor, they were telling me that I no longer qualified to receive the help with the ppp program that I was using them for. Mainly because it took them so long to get to my application that a new tax season had passed, and they said I no longer qualified and we're not able to help me anymore. Luckily the new bank reached out to me personally and got me my money within a week after 6 months of running around with Lendio. Then two weeks after I've already received my money straight from the bank, I get an email asking ME if I had any news about the PPP application, despite the fact they said I no longer qualified and they couldn't help me.",1
Needs to manage partners better,"I applied for a PPP loan with Lendio.  The application was straight forward.  Problems occurred when they handed it off to Ready Capital.  There was a problem with loan details I identified before funds were deposited.  Icontacted ready capital multiple times and submitted help desk tickets to get the error corrected early.  Ready Capital did not correct it, and there was little coordination with Lendio email messages.Long story short, this error prevented me from accessing the PPP funds for several weeks while I tried to clean up the mess with my bank.  Lendio initially blew off my criticisms and said it was Ready Capital’s fault.  I disagree.  I did business with Lendio.  It is Lendio’s responsibility to mange its partners and vendors and make its customers whole when their vendor drops the ball.",2

Honestly, I was surprised there was even still PPP funds available by the time Lendio decided the documents they had for months were sufficient.. Sadly it wasn't just me that had this experience. A fellow business owner I know ONLY managed to get someone to call him back about his application after posting a public message on twitter, tagging the CEO. This was the 2nd time that I used Lendio for my PPP loan, however I am confident that I will not use them by choice in the future.",1

The worst experience I've ever had in finance,"One of the worst experiences I've ever had with a lending organization. I applied for my PPP loan through Lendio back in March, when finally it moved to the final phase (after I received an SBA loan number) they were absolutely impossible to get ahold of through email, phone, or their online chat. I would leave countless voicemails with multiple representatives, and leave emails, and after 5 business days of attempting to talk to a rep, they would come back with some additional document they would need that I would then get to them in under 24 hours, just for them to vanish again. This happened 4-5 times in a row until the lender rejected the SBA loan due to not receiving the documents from them in a timely manner, and its been weeks now and one of the representatives still haven't even responded to my last slew of voicemails/emails to let me know the loan was rejected, I had to log into their ""portal"" to find out.",1

I went to another lender and was approved without all of this back -n- fourth and requiring no additional information. They got all they needed in there initial application.

Using Lendio was truly a terrible experience,"Using Lendio was truly a terrible experience.The website and user interface is awful, but the customer service really takes the prize for one of the worst things I've experience in a pretty long time. Many many times after I had completed the application, they would just send an email (along with a simultaneous text and automated phone call) with a list of documents (I assume they were requesting I send those documents to them, but can't say for sure). Literally that's all the email would say - no greeting, no instructions, no context. Not to mention that these were always documents that I had already provided. And then when I would respond with a question, they would just with the exact same message as before - so it was either a robot or I just wasn't important to enough to deserve the time it takes to write full sentences. Also, I was approved for a PPP loan amount and then they later came back and said they were revising the amount and reduced down to about 10% of the original approved amount. So yeah, I don't have much to say that's positive.",1

This happened about four times and each time I resubmitted the docs or re-did the application as requested. This went on for over two months and in the mean time I never knew if I was getting the loan or not. I tried several times to call or email and they never answer the phone or responded to emails. After about two months of the runaround I gave up on the idea of getting the loan but then I started receiving messages from them saying that if I didn’t finish my application process soon I would miss my opportunity.  So again I tried to call and sent emails and again never got a response. Low and behold about the third month, I logged into my bank account and the money I applied for was there.

"Lendio should be ashamed, and barred from acting as an SBA lender","I applied for a PPP loan through Lendio on the first day that funds became available, in late January 2021. Since then, over the past nearly four months, I've had the most frustrating experience of my life—literally HUNDREDS of unanswered phone calls and emails to Lendio (not joking, hundreds), no status updates, no information, and all the while literally every other business I know has long since funded through other lenders. For the past two months, on the rare occasions that I've been able to make contact, Lendio has assured me that my loan was in the final stages, and within a week or two of funding. My loan has been with the lender, Ready Capital, for a month. Just today, I received an email saying that the PPP funds are gone and I'm not getting my loan. My business has been devastated by COVID, and though we're starting to bounce back, I've been banking on PPP funds to get us through the next four months, especially as other relief (like rent relief from my commercial landlord) are ending. To say I'm frustrated is the understatement of a lifetime. This is absolutely devastating for my business, myself, and my employees, and not receiving my funds is 100% the fault of Lendio and Ready Capital. This has been the worst experience with a lender (or business of any kind) that I've ever had. The program designed to support small businesses has instead cost me countless hours of my time, an exorbitant amount of stress, and now Lendio has screwed me out of the money my business desperately needs out of their own inept handling of PPP applications. At a vulnerable time for small business in this country, their behavior is disgraceful. DO NOT USE LENDIO.",1

I filled out the PPP loan application…,"I filled out the PPP loan application with the wrong information and submitted it. Then I spoke with my accountant who told me to redo it. I called Lendio and they said they would put it on hold and I could edit it. A few days later, I got the correct figures from my accountant and saw I was entitled to a much larger PPP loan. I called Lendio and was told to just redo the figures on my already existing application. This was at the beginning of March. However, Lendio had already send my information on to Ready Capital and a few days later I received documents to sign from Ready Capital for the lower loan. For two months, I wasted time on hold and speaking to people at both companies, and uploading the same documents over and over. I kept being told that the issue was being taken care of.  One week before the money ran out, I got an email from Ready Capital saying that they could not give me the revised amount since I had not filed a schedule C (but since I am a partnership, I am not supposed to file a schedule C - that was one of the changes my accountant had me fix!). I could accept the lower amount of nothing. Someone from Lendio called me and told me to accept the lower amount; that it better to have something than nothing. So that is what I did.In the end, I realize that I should have cancelled the entire loan application and started from the beginning and I would not have had these programs. At one point I asked Lendio if that is what I should do, but the only answer I got was, ""Is that what you want to do?""Because they did not steer me in the right direction, I did was unable to receive a substantially larger amount, was full of anxiety, and wasted many hours with hours, phone calls and letters of explanation trying to rectify the situation.",1

This have been the worst, emotionally draining and frustrating company I have ever in life dealt with. I applied on March 25, 2021, had heard nothing from them at all until I was SBA approved May 14, 2021. Ready Capital denied me after SBA approval because of lack of information. When I reached out to Ready Capital they stated they did not receive the information they needed from Lendio. My funding manager was Ailie Finsland when this initially occurred. Ready Capital then reopened requested documents which I turned in to Ailie Finsland. After Ready Capital received all requested documents, I finally received my PN and signed it on May 22, 2021. The very next day my funding manager changed to Dianne Navarro, who then says my application started all over entirely. I contacted Ready Capital who says I was in the funded stage and have been trying to contact Dianne Navarro to see we’re the miscommunication came in at. She does NOT respond to any of my emails and when I call her and tell her my name she hangs up. It has been 3 weeks with this same issue. I have been SBA approved since 5/14/21, signed my PN 5/22/21 and been in funded status since and have yet to receive any funds. I am keeping my business afloat as much as possible, however, this definitely would do its job and protect my business. Unfortunately, at this time my funding manager has not returned emails or calls and have me sitting in limbo. Now applications are no longer being accepted and I am near or possibly pass the SBA allotted time frame to be funded. Simply because of incompetent people there is now a high possibility my business will not be funded. All I was trying to do was reach out to see if I was missing anything at all and what was going on but I could not even get as much as a response back. That’s my experience, hopefully yours is better than mine, good luck!",1

Horrible don’t go through this company,"Submitted my Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) application early in the “pre application” window, waited 5 months for Lendio to process my application only to find out they took too long and I missed out on the PPP because of them even though I did everything correctly and even submitted my application early.  Here are some highlights, * TERRIBLE communication, worst I’ve ever seen from a company. They never told me they needed anything from me, they never contacted me for anything, no updates on the progress etc. The only times I found out they were waiting on a document from me was when I called in. I even checked my spam email and logged into my Lendio account every day. * Wrong information was displayed on my dashboard * Said they needed documents I already gave them multiple times* Got a different story nearly every time I talked them. For example I emailed them for an update and they said the SBA couldn’t match the loan number to the one I gave them even though the number I had was off an official SBA document that said “loan number”. Called Lendio to give that to them and turns out they didn't need the loan number they needed my businesses EIN - even though they already had it, it was on 3 or 4 of the documents I had given them and in the information I filled out on the application. * Was assigned a funding manager which seemed great but they changed my manager 5 times in 4 months and NONE of them helped me. Most of the responses I got from them were poorly written emails with weird email signatures that actually made me question if it was spam. One manager even asked me to send a picture of my ID through email (even though I already uploaded it during the application) which is not secure and when it is possible to do this online. I did everything I was supposed to and was treated terribly and ultimately missed out on the PPP because of Lendio. This is probably the worst experience I have ever had with a company as a whole. I’ve had more unprofessional encounters with reps but never had an experience like this with a company as a whole.",1
Lendio Screwed Up My PPP Application,"I trusted Lendio to get me my PPP loan. Big mistake. I first applied back in 2020, when the first PPP draw began. By the time the money ran out, my application had not been approved. When the program rebooted in January of this year, I renewed my application and the portal showed progress over the course of about a month. ""We've received your application!""""We are reviewing your application!""""We've sent your application to lenders!"" Then it reversed course.""We're reviewing your application!""""We've received your application!""Wait. What?I began the frustrating process of getting answers to my questions.Online chat, emails to the ""Account Manager"", finally a phone conversation.They said they needed to clarify some documents and have me change a couple of things in the application... Isn't this part of that review they supposedly did a month ago? Were they planning on telling me about these things instead of waiting for me to contact them?Long story, shorter, after three months they said they couldn't process my paperwork. Not that there was anything wrong with it. Then, magically a week later I was contacted by a lender that works with Lendio. Huh. SmartBiz had my application and was processing it... Okay, great.They asked my for my partnership agreement. I'm a sole proprietor....They asked for my first draw loan number. This is still the application for my first draw...so no loan number.SmartBiz then told me that they couldn't process my loan...Then, I magically received a Docusign request to sign loan docs for my first draw PPP. I filled it out and got my loan a week later.This process took over a year. Now the funds have run out again, and my application for my second draw has been cancelled because it took so long. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if I received an email in a week or so saying that my second draw has been approved, but I'm not holding my breath....Ultimately, I feel like this has been mishandled from the beginning. These loan amounts were quite small as they were for my personal income with no employees. My industry went completely silent for the past year and a half.I live in an underserved zip code. Research tells me that the bulk of the PPP funds went to businesses in high income zip codes. I believe the statistics.",1
Waste of time with this company,"Nightmare started with Lendio sending my PPP application to Ready Capital in March 202l. Cannot fault Lendio for how bad Ready Capital lied to me after signing the loan doc's and having SBA number in April. HOWEVER, after promising me everything looked good and confirming the issues at Ready are widespread, told me they (Lendio) were sending my application to another Lender on 5/19/21 via email from Bailey Wall. Multiple emails sent, including Lendio's main email, and to this point totally ""ghosted"". Maybe Ready Capital put Lendio in a really bad spot, but at a minimum, you communicate with your customers. I will update and change rating if Lendio EVER GET'S BACK TO ME!!!!!!!Ok, so I see Lendio has responded with request for more information, not sure how I can do that without giving private information on Trustpilot.You could start by looking at emails I sent to Bailey Wall, and also your general email.First name is Eric, last name starts with ""Wil""Just send email to your customer service email with Full Name and mentioned Trustpilot review.Business is under my name as I am sole contractor, self employed. Located in Indiana, area code on my mobile is 317. Need anything else??UPDATE 5/28/21 3:16PMWell I responded with information (see above). Do you have what you need? Have you checked emails? Still nothing,,,,,you stated you wanted to get back to me today!UPDATE 5/28/21 5:38PMWas contacted by Rob at Lendio who seems to be all over this now. Will see how it goes next week, however, he did offer a sincere apology for previous lending manager's issues, and has promised to step in and make it happen, which is all I can ask right now. Good first step.UPDATE 6/9/21 6:34PMShocker, after the original call due to my review on TP from Rob at Lendio on 5/28/21, complete ghost job. Have sent numerous emails and voicemails to him as well as their customer service email, zero replies.It is very clear this company simply does not care, at all.UPDATE 6/28/21Yet another funding manager with the below email;Hello Eric, Netia with Lendio. I have looked over your file and show that your currently in the funding stage, this has been escalated to our Funding Desk for status and to speed things up. Please note when a SBA number is assigned funds should be reserved and we should still have until June 30, 2021, to get you funded! Thank youAny yet a new funding manager today with an email stating the lender has terminated my funding request without ever telling me who the lender was. Supposed to get a communication from whoever the bank is with more detail.Looks like no funds for me, and an crazy poor process from Lendio.",1
I mistakenly trusted Lendio to get me my PPP loan,"I began my Lendio application process for a PPP loan for my small business in the middle of January 2021. I didn't receive the loan until the middle of May, and by then my chances of a second draw were snuffed out.For three months, my application collected dust while I reached out to my Lendio representative, the fourth one that had been assigned to me, by email, text, and phone call. They never responded. I understood I wasn't the only application they were working on, but I felt my application had been forgotten.Meanwhile, Lendio's Newsroom boasted of having ""placed special emphasis on funding the nation’s smallest businesses, including sole proprietors and independent contractors, as well as other segments of borrowers who were underserved in previous rounds... increasing the distribution of loans to smaller, women-owned and minority-owned businesses."" I'm a sole proprietor and a woman, and not once did I feel this drive.In the middle of March, I emailed my representative asking about Lendio's statement that my loan could be based on my Gross Income rather than my Net Income. This would have essentially double my loan amount. I agreed to the change on the website but never saw a change in the Borrower Portal for the new amount. I reached out and asked my representative about that, and again, never received a response of any kind.I sent in extra documents requested along the way, but it never seemed to be enough. I was nervous. That's an understatement. I was terrified that my business wouldn't make it to the end of the year. The PPP deadline, fortunately, moved from the end of March to the end of May so I had a sliver of hope to hold onto.It was radio silence from my representative until I sent an email blast on April 26th to my representative and the three prior representatives basically telling them what you've read so far. Suddenly, I was a top priority. The missing documentation was no longer a mystery, and things were in motion. I still didn't know what my loan amount was as my representative dodged the question every time I asked it. For the record, I asked seven times between March 16th and May 4th.When the loan contract finally came through, it was Friday April 30th. I checked the loan amount. It was to be the original amount based on my Net Income rather than my Gross Income. I asked for it to be corrected. As it was Friday, I waited until Monday to reach out a second time. I reached out and heard nothing back. I emailed again on May 4th, but heard nothing. It turned out I once again had a new representative, so I reached out to them and waited.Then it was Wednesday May 5th. In my inbox from Lendio I saw an email that said ""PPP Funds have run out, but your amount has been reserved."" Now I'm frantic and furious and frustrated and upset and angry and STILL no one has gotten back to me. My accountant and I called and called and called. We finally get the Long Island representative who doesn't understand why I was ignored over and over again. My new representative reaches out and tells me the same, that the last representative's inattentiveness caused me to lose out on what could have been four times the loan amount.FOUR. TIMES. THE. AMOUNT.So now my options were to sign the PPP loan contract I had received or walk away with nothing. It wasn't a choice. I signed the contract. I asked if there was a chance for a second draw. I was told there had been funds set aside for small businesses owned by women and BIPOC, but that Lendio had been telling their clients to apply through a smaller institution to get it.I tried. It froze by the end of the week.When the funds finally hit my business account on May 13th, I wrote myself the paychecks I needed to keep me afloat. I put the experience in the back of my mind.Until today. When Lendio asked me for a five star review, I laughed out loud. I guess we don't always get what we want.",1
I’ve already written a review,"I've been through various aspects of the Lendio experience five times now. This is the second time I'm writing such a review; the first time, last summer, they requested a chance to change my mind. After my follow-up experiences, this review is going to be worse. In summary, Lendio is phenomenal at selling nasty lines of credit at usurious rates, and terrible at providing you with something you might actually want...in my case, an SBA loan.My very first contact/loan officer at Lendio was Johnny-on-the-spot. He did things like texting to let me know he was stepping out to lunch, but if I happened to send any docs over in the meantime, he'd look at them as soon as he got back and would call me. Y'know, above-and-beyond stuff. He was also very friendly and knowledgeable. I wound up signing up for a $60,000 LOC with amortized, one-year payback on the draws, which is cool, except the rate is (seriously) higher than any of my credit cards. And they pull a 3% fee out of every draw, so even if you pay it back the next day, you've already eaten a sizable piece. Fair's fair; I mean, I could take it or leave it. I took it, very hesitantly. Just in case, y'know?To date, I've taken three draws totaling $20k, and paid them all back as quickly as I could. One could argue that Lendio did me a service, because taking the money was obviously less painful than not taking it. That's a valid argument...maybe they were a net positive in my life. But barely. And for all the effort, they should have netted out a lot more positive. I'm really not sure what kind of financing most businesses are used to getting, but in my experience, this sort of thing doesn't belong in America. Unless you're a terrible borrower. Which I'm not.K, so asking about someone's offerings and finding out they suck isn't all that bad, but what came next is what inspired me to write–twice. The thing is, as I mentioned, I went to Lendio in the first place because they plug SBA loans on their website. The SBA specialist I was assigned after the LOC was in place repeatedly dropped the ball on my case, basically ignoring me for months. I eventually wrote a TrustPilot review kinda like this one, and was getting some urgent, kid glove treatment within about thirty seconds of posting. I was re-delegated to a different loan officer, who came off with a song and dance to behold. Gauging the quality of THAT relationship took some time, because gathering up all the docs the SBA requires can take some doing. Those poor loan officers wait on us like sailors' widows! But I always tried to set expectations about how long something would take me or my CPA to sort out, and then reciprocated with what I felt was an ample amount of objective patience once I'd done my homework. I mean, it's really not cool to drag your heels for months and then be like ""K, here it is, I want answers yesterday!"" So I didn't. Well, once I'd done all my stuff, the loan officer became entirely unhelpful. They ended with ""sorry, you don't have enough income for the SBA"". My CPA says ""Look at the damn return, it shows $52k in book income. That's over 10% of gross, how much net does the SBA want to see?"" to which the LO essentially replies ""The SBA doesn't make those numbers known, please try again next year."" When we asked things like ""What sort of nets and ratios have you seen get approved, and in all your vast experience as a Lendio loan officer who specializes in the SBA, where have you kinda sorta seen the threshold to be, 'cause I don't have to take all these write-offs"" we get totally ghosted. It's been months.Here's the rub. During all that time I was rummaging down this SBA rabbit hole, I was getting calls from other Lendiots saying things like ""Hey, your numbers are looking really good, why don't I shop around for something even better for you?"" Twice, I assented. Both times, after the back and forth, they're like ""Wow, that LOC you've already got, yeah, the one with the 30% interest rate, that seems to be the best thing we have!"" The other crap they were throwing out there, well, I probably couldn't do better going to Rico the payday lender across the tracks, but it wouldn't be far off.So in my summation, Lendio probably doesn't even do SBA loans, they probably just have someone there to string you along for months while other bozos try and hook you on subprime crap. I do gotta say, the initial application is fairly slick, and the brand and people are all so friendly and aw-shucksy and full of Utah, it's very disarming. But their actual products are a joke, and I think there's some smoke and mirrors going on. Funny, I knew Lendio’s founder in college, and I've watched his career with a fair amount of admiration. But now I think he's more along the lines of one of these broey titans of pest control/home automation: rich, maybe, but very minimal contribution to humanity.",1
I never received my pp loan,"Terrible service, SO SLOW! It took over 2 months to get this processed!! Ridulous.",1
Thanks you so much,I applied for my 1st draw of ppp loan application through lendio. Lendio has sent me to the ready capital the affiliated lender I’m not happy with the ready capital services regarding on my ppp application process they are slow not following up on time sending me same emails twice for the same request I’m still waiting to get my second ppp draw funding from them but still no response as I was expecting... however I honestly don’t know how lendio process works I got ready capital and my expirence with them is quiet disappointing me..,2
Acting somehow,This was the worst lending experience I've ever been a part of.  There were multiple people that asked for the same information over and over and automated emails that made no sense both before and after getting the loan.,2
Poor customer service,"We did 2 PPP loans through them for our two companies. One went fine although it asked for different information after the application that should have just been asked for in the application.  The other one was terrible. Got the application approved and the SBA number right away. However after this we could never find what the status was, continuously reached out to the loan manager to never get a response, and called other customer service people to get nowhere. Eventually, did get it through and funded after over a month and a half. It was very frustrating.",2
Horrible experience.,"5/10/2021 - PPP money ran out and my concern is now real.  Appalling!  No money and no recourse!Applied for 2nd draw PPP loan on 2/26/2021.  It is now 4/29/2021 and we are still getting the run around.  No approval, application still under review and no solid answers.  Twitter has responded but no real answers.  My funding manger reached out twice but is now MIA.  When the PPP funds run out and my company is left out because of Lendio, what do I do then?",1
Lendio Not Helping Matters!!!!,"I am so upset that I start with your company, no one answering my call or my email. Almost 3 moth ago we start and I have no idea what is status of my caseYou told me that I have been approved on 4/19, and just wait 10 days,  today is almost 5/10, still nothing Don’t want any other people deal with your company You are not reliable.....",1
No responses No loan,"Representatives are not responsive. A company with a good idea poorly executed.Update 04/29/2021: Their response to my original comment above is a non-response and written merely to show readers that they were able to secure funding. In fact it took nearly four months, amidst mass confusion among their staff, phone calls ignored and not returned, and miscommunications almost weekly. Lendio is merely a middle man. And not a good one at that. Go direct.",1
very slow process,Very bad and poor communication lake of knowledge from most of the representatives and list goes on,2
Very slow process,My loan was funded on the 20th and I still have not received it yet I am not happy as of now !!!!😡😡😡,2
Bad experience,"I signed the same 3 contracts over 6 weeks due to some problem that no-one could disclose to me.  Turns out that once the 1st draw finally funded, it was so late that I am not be able to apply for 2nd draw.  Maybe that was a coincidence, right?I believe that's 3 strikes, arguably 4.  Who's counting though? One star because the 1st draw finally funded.  Lendio almost elevated several stars here if I actually received an email to submit the 2nd draw, as their reply stated.  I never received any additional communication for submitting the 2nd draw.",2
Ignored and Underserved,"Worst experience. Use anyone else! I applied for my second round PPP in January and it’s now 4/27 and have yet to be funded. They keep asking for the same paperwork 5 times, they had an incorrect loan number, and just paperwork has been messed up in every way. Their customer service is the absolute worst-no one returns your calls or emails and they give you a different point person every time. It’s been a second job following up every day for months.",1
"All about sales, low on substance",PPP loan forgiveness took over 6 months.  It was ridiculous.,1
Terrible service,"Getting funded took way too long for 2nd draw.  We did our 1st draw through AMEX, and it went very smoothly and very quickly.  AMEX referred 2nd draw folks to Lendio.  I started on the Lendio app 1/19.  I signed loan documents on 2/17 but was never funded.  I furnished Lendio everything under the sun as soon as it was requested; however, I kept getting emails that my loan was incomplete. Lendio also kept changing my funding manager.  I tried to apply with another lender; however, since we had an SBA loan number, I was not successful.  We finally got funded on 4/16.  I would never recommend Lendio to anyone.",1

At first I thought this was a joke, but I soon realized that there was nothing I could do to satisfy this business and I started to worry that they were trying to obtain personal information for purposes other than this loan.",1
PPP Forgiveness,"Complete and utter disaster! I would not recommend Lendio for any lending process as it relates to PPP. The initial application process I completed in early February was very simple. A few days later I received my SBA Loan number and this is where it went downhill. My loan officer would send generate emails and then claim that I wasn't communicating which I was, threaten to put my file on inactive status, then randomly I got sent the Loan Documents and then had to contact the actual lender for 2 1/2 weeks for them to tell me it was a Lendio issue and they had to fix it, then not having a real way to contact someone at Lendio as the agents number never ring, they rarely return to text messages and then one random day nearly 30 days after signing documents and some faux request for additional documents that were never truly requesed, I magically was funded. It was a complete diaster and I understand this is a new lending line (PPP) but the lack of communication, confusion and all over the place would cause me to NEVER recommend Lendio.",2

I’m not receiving any follow ups. Somehow, my loan was split into 2 loans and I received the lowest amount first, (of course). This lender has placed the blame on SBA with no specific details for almost 3 weeks now. I’m STUCK! With no one to talk to, explain, respond or assist in progressing forward.

Over the last two months, I have called in 6 times, chatted in 4 times, was sent up the chain numerous times, and connected with my ""funding manager"" who changed from B____, R___, P_____, T______, L_____, C_____, and J____ (updated to S_____ today, by the way). All of them assured me that i should keep going and gave me advice for more work. No one reached out to let me know the status, i had to reach out every time.All in all i have put in over a dozen hours at their encouragement and suggestion. Then today happened. Loan denied due to the EXACT reason that I called to confirm in before i even applied. I get that I'm not a big business to them, but how little they cared about my time and passed me around and lead me on is a monumental lapse of training and professionalism. Would not and could not recommend them in any way.",1

Not responsive,"If I could give a 0 star, I would. I applied PPP round 2 through Lendio. My company is newly founded in 2019, starting business in the second half of 2019, and started issuing payroll in the last quarter of 2019. The business got hit bad by Covid in 2020 like many other companies. When I got the SBA contract, I found that SBA was mistakenly using 12 months to calculate my monthly payroll cost, which significantly reducing the loan amount. I immediately contacted Lendio, but got no reply after numerous phone, voice mail, and email. I do understand that everyone is working hard to go through this tough time together, and mistakes/errors are inevitable. However, the way Lendio handled my case was not professional, and I am not satisfied with the customer service at all. Had I known that, I would have chosen another broker for my PPP loan.Update:After I wrote this review, Lendio replied to me the same day that ""lenders are looking at your 12 months of payroll to validate the loan amount. ""This is non-sense. They don't even bother to read my post entirely and carefully.First of all, I stated very clearly, in the review, and my previous communication with Lendio, that my company was a new one in 2019, and the payroll amount was for just 3 month. I only gave them document for 3 month payroll of 2019, since that is all was available. Where can they ""look at 12 month payroll""?Secondly, during the application process, I did my best to reach out to Lendio for at least a whole week (email, phone, voice mail), but received no reply. Now Lendio came up a lame excuse, the very same day of my review, trying to cover it up as a PR campaign. Charming.Update2:This becomes very interesting. Right after I post the 1st update, I got another reply from Lendio: ""When calculating loan amounts, the lenders base the amount on the documents you provide.""I really don't know what they are talking about. Everything they say seems ""politically correct"", but it doesn't make any difference. I said very clearly, that I gave them 3 months payroll in 2019, and they treated it as 12 months payroll. The calculation was way off. I don't know what they are looking at.This is very simply. If you made a mistake, just admit it and clean up the mess. You should learn is from Kindergarten. Everyone makes mistakes, including myself. And I understand Lendio may be under pressure and could make mistakes during this difficult time. However, trying to cover that up just doesn't work and actually makes it worse.What is more, I even start to suspect that if Lendio's replies are from robots, not an actual person. During my application, Lendio kept telling me to contact them with any questions, but when I contacted them, either there was no reply, or an email that was totally unrelated to what I was asking. This time for my review, it is just impressive that they replied so fast and so not-to-the-point.Lendio, can you stop doing these non-sense? Can you have a real person call me to resolve it rather than reply these non-sense?",2
No communication,"Terrible experience. Used them for ppp loans. No communication during the process. Their actions resulted in me missing out on working with other loan companies and meant i received less than i was eligible due to impossibly difficult communications. Completely dropped the ball and the impact still being felt. Would actively dissuade anybody who is considering them and I will be looking at whether i have options to pursue legal remedies for their misrepresentation and mishandling of my loans.UPDATE: I got the exact reply you would expect from a company that IS NOT EVEN A LENDER, so had to update further as a cautionary tale!! Lendio took no time to review the specifics of my application - they aren't the Lender, so I guess why do they care? When the PPP rules changed, I was not given any opportunity to make changes - as an independent contractor, I was eligible to use a different line item on Sched C tax form for the PPP amount this year. When I requested to make changes, I was told that I would have to start my application again - not a big deal if the company you are working with is quick and seamless. In this case, I opted to stay the course due to the impossibly difficult time to get any communication. The ONLY reason I ended up with any funding was because I reached out directly to the Lender that was backing the loan, AGAINST LENDIO'S DIRECTION. If I had stuck by Lendio, I would still be waiting.Meanwhile - I also applied for a ppp for my 2nd business. That loan app fell through because the lender did not receive any of my documentation updates/constant communication from Lendio. Here's the point: IF you are seeking a loan GO DIRECT to the LENDER not to the middle man Lendio!",1
I would not recommend Lendio to anyone.,Poor communication. Did not give me the new amount with the SBA New guidelines even after I requested and updated my application.  Terrible company.,1
I did not like the idea of chasing you…,I think Lendio did a terrible job as a broker of ppp loan for my company.  There were so many missteps and lies being told during the application and funding process.  It took over 3 months to get first ppp funded from application.  This is unacceptable and unwarranted. Lendio is incapable of handling ppp applications as a third party broker and should be banned from processing sba applications.  I share the frustration of many small business owners who had to waste time in followup of a simple application process. Bottom line is they aren’t organized or their staff is ill equipped to handle ppp applications.,1
Having a Bad PPP experience with Lendio,I wrote a review and spoke my opinion. Never put my name out. And why did your company reveal my account details of approval and disclose my name?!!. Well you should know that is a Confidentiality Clause you just violated!! Take it down or I will see you in Court.,1
Complete and utter disaster,"Let’s start w I got my fund tho. But it takes 3 months longer than my friends. This company might be super busy and lack of training how to handle the situation like pandemic. I got ask for the same docs about 3 times. ID 3 times, statement 2 times, 941 3 times. It just repeats non stop. Customer service was super nice tho. Of course it take 24 hours to get a hold to someone but at least they still get back which it’s nice. Everything good but lack of well planed management. I’m the person who do 1 star or 5 stars. In this case I gave them 1.",1
No follow up or progress in 3 weeks!,"I have requested for this Lender to ""CANCEL"" my PPP loan with them and they have failed to do so. On April 16 I log onto the Lendio site to cancel my PPP app because I no longer wanted to do business with Lendio due to their unprofessionalism and I was unable via their site to cancel my app. So I called in for the supervisor by the name of ""Philip Wheel"" but he was Unavailable so a rep by the name of ""Michelle"" answered the phone and stated that she will send Mr. Wheel an email regarding the cancellation, but I have yet to hear back from Philip Wheel or from Lendio regarding my request to CANCEL.  I made a decision to CANCEL because the level of customer service experience with this company has been very unprofessional and exhausting. All I am asking is for the company to please cancel my App and send me confirmation to my email showing that my App has been canceled.",1
Just Wow.,"The good news is, I eventually got the funding for my PPP loan. Key word, EVENTUALLY. I started my application for my 2nd PPP Loan at the end of January 2021. I finally got funded in April after being on top of every document from the moment it was requested! The biggest frustration I had was their process. I started off with one rep, then when the initial paperwork was completed, I got a notice that the lender was looking for something else that wasn't listed in the required documents list that I was provided by the rep up front. So I attached the documents and emailed them immediately to that rep. Then, several days later, I was contacted by a new rep that said they were the person that was taking my application to the next step, and they needed to verify my address because I had recently moved. Sent that person proof of address, she told me she'd call me within 24 hours to update me on the status of my loan. 24, 48, 72 hours goes by, no call, no email from that rep...I call that rep's phone number, get sent to voicemail. Get an email from now a 3rd different person stating they needed something else now!! I said, OK, but who are you? ""I am the person that will be taking your loan through the next part of this process."" Ok, so once I send you these things I'll be ready to receive funds? ""YEP! And I'll put you on my notes to call within 24 hours to update you, just to make sure!"" 24, 48, 72 hours goes by... my patience starts to wear really thin... It's now the beginning of March, having started at the end of January... funds within 72 hours my ass!I try to contact that rep 3 separate times after waiting patiently 72 hours after I was told 24.... Get now ANOTHER NEW REP!!! At this point I'm furious. I should've had the same person from start to finish working with me so I didn't have to re-explain myself every time I got on the phone. This gentleman tells me, ""I'm the rep that will get you through the next part of this loan process and I see your loan looks good and is with the lender now. Please be patient as they process your funds to be sent to you."" I wait, and wait, and wait, and wait...Then I get an email from the SBA stating that my loan hasn't funded in the 20 day period necessary and my SBA number has now been terminated... Please remember, we're in the middle of a pandemic and my funds are extremely depleted and I'm COUNTING ON THIS MONEY TO KEEP MY BUSINESS ALIVE and it's not even that much!!! So I am furious at this point and try to call and email my latest rep, and all of a sudden I'm sent to a customer service general inbox. WHAT IN THE ABSOLUTE HELL IS GOING ON WITH THIS COMPANY is the only thought in my brain, quickly followed by AM I EVER GOING TO GET THIS LOAN???The only saving grace was that I was actually contacted via phone after stating my frustration to their customer service department in an email. Laura, a manager here, called me and looked at my situation and personally handled my application with a new lender from start to finish and I was funded within about 10 days.My question for Lendio is, why couldn't I have just had one single rep working with me from start to finish that could call me back like they said they would to keep me updated and give me the peace of mind I was looking for? Your process was atrocious and flat out inefficient. Whoever came up with the way to handle things has hopefully been re-trained and put into a different role that they are more suited for or is flipping burgers at a local fast food joint where their process and mentality of the assembly line actually fits and supports the business model. The only reason it's two stars instead of 1 is because I did at the end of all this get my loan. I would never work with Lendio in the future on something so critical to the lifeblood of my business.",1
I did not receive my full eligible…,Very bad customer service. No human to talk to you and discuss your account. You won't know what's going on until you chat with support and they are limited to helping you. Never again will I use this company.,1
they were slow to respond,Virtually no person to person comunication.  I have important questions that have not been resolved and am very unhappy with Lendio's service.  Would not recomend this company.,2
Textbook case of terrible customer service,"It took three months, dozens of emails, and over 5 interventions by the referring loan agency before Lendio fixed its errors, recalculated the loan, referred the loan to another lender, and completed the loan.  They sent numerous blanket emails that called for unnecessary resubmissions, changed their online application three times in a the same number of weeks, and failed to return phone calls and emails for weeks at a time.  Their lending officers often seemed clueless, and their programming quality control seemed non-existent.",1
Horrible with communication,"Customer service was horrible. Their systems were consistently overwhelmed. Many times we could not connect with anyone via phone or online chat. We were passed from funding manager to funding manager with near zero contact with any of them. We received random, confusing emails from people at Lendio that we didn't know after not hearing from anyone for weeks. Then we would get no response.The site itself is glitchy, constantly making you click through your application to get to the status update - even after submitting. The handoff to the ultimate lender was painful and we are still receiving duplicate, outdated emails.You would never know their core business revolved around connecting lenders with borrowers. It seemed like the first time they had done anything like this.",1
I highly recommend avoiding Lendio for…,"Was paired with a subpar lender who appeared to fund me, but never actually did. They sent disputing communication about docs being signed and not signed. They said I was funded, but I was not. Tried to contact the lender, but didn’t get a response until I got an inside track on a contact from SBA and started leaving multiple messages about withdrawing my application. Only then did anyone bother to return communication. Tried to contact Lendio and no one would return my emails or texts for days. I had to withdraw my application and work to extract my application from the sketchy lender. Then Lendio had a different rep contact me as though nothing had happened. Nothing but bad to say about this company. Stay away.",1
No Star,"I hate to ding Lendio because my first PPP (Celtic Bank as the underwriter) loan went seamlessly.  However, this time I was pared with Ready Capital and have nothing but frustrations. Like many others, I received my SBA loan number, and shortly after, signed my contract. Since then, I have sent my 2019 Federal tax return 3 times.  Ready Capital has ghosted me.  I have sent numerous emails, called multiple times (I get a message that states they are too busy to take my call and then hangs up).  I have even sent an email to their Chairman.  Soon my SBA number will expire.  I am getting my attorney involved if this is not resolved by the end of the week. Seems this may be a breach of contract.  I would give Lendio high marks, but for their partnership with Ready Capital.  Simply Unexceptable.",1
Terrible experience,"Almost impossible to get a response, lender was unreachable",1
Poor communication,Very slow response and no live person to help,1
I think Lendio did a terrible job as a…,"Well, I find it odd that I got an invite to review as I have not been funded. I was approved, sent to a lender (who has reserved my sba number thereby insuring that I can not go elsewhere for funding) signed loan documents, and now can't get a response from either company. I signed 2 weeks ago and have yet to receive funding. I reached out to lendio hoping that they would help me with lender and no response.In response to the response from LendioI was not approved on April 5th. I signed my loan paperwork (already approved) on the March 30th. I guess I should be glad to have gotten a response at all considering I havnt gotten any to any of the emails I have sent regarding this matter.Update 4/28/21I have still not had any communication from the lende other than them sending me yet another loan agreement to sign.  lendio said they would look into it but I have yet to hear back. Lendio has sent me several congratulatory emails for ""being funded"" but I have yet to receive funds. My account says funded with the SBA as well, so I have already been removed from other supplemental programs as a result, but I have zero funds and no idea when/if I will receive them. Choosing lendio to handle my PPP loan may be the worst business decision I have ever made and it may even end up costing me my business.",1
I wrote a review and spoke my opinion,"my income in 2019 was more than 75 thousand and my loan approval was too low, I think my income document was not reviewed correctly",1
Got the fund but took forever,"We never spoke to an actual person. Over 6 people sent emails saying they were handling our account. Ever time we asked for an update we got an automated email saying our account was being processed. When the loan finally went through, we did not even receive an email that it has been approved. Left in the dark the whole time",1
Request to CANCEL MY PPP LOAN,It was the worst company everYo hard my application in custody for two months,1
"Save your time, go somewhere they have a good process because Lendio doesn't have one",Chaotic and disorganized. Really wish I would have chosen a different middle-man to refer a lender given there are so many better options. I would have had my funds weeks earlier if I would have avoided Lendio.,2
Very bad customer service,"My experience has been ok , but it could be better if I could get more information on my application. My funding manager never answers.",1
Virtually no person to person…,"WOMPLY ALL THE WAY. SKIP OVER LENDIO IF YOU WANT FAST PROCESSING WITHOUT LIES. Original review: Lendio took over a week to resend docusign for PPP1. For PPP2 they havent responded to more than five emails and as a result have costed me an extra 13 days processing time so likely leaving me out of funding for PPP2 before PPP funds run out. 0/5 stars. Garbage. Go Womply all the way for anyone who reads this.EDIT : Lendio responded ""Hey Ethan. You were notified on 3/31 that you've been approved for funds. We also have responded to all the messages that you've sent us.""Absolute lie. I would upload all screenshots of the unanswered emails sent to Lendio but this platform lacks that capability as far as I can tell. Hey Lendio, Maybe check : sarah flores at ls.lendio.cominbox. Or atleast respond to the majority of pertinent information in my review?",2
Worst loan experience of my 40-year professional career.,"Took forever, got passed around from agent to agent. Told to apply elsewhere at one point. NEVER AGAIN.",2
Our experience with Lendio was a near disaster,"The worst!!!! No one ever got back to me, it was so difficult. I am so disappointed!",1
Awful service. Sketchy. Save yourself the trouble.,"Finally got my loan after 4 months, after never being able to speak to the 4 funding managers I was passed onto during the duration. The only people that ever answer the phone if you wait long enough is the Customer Service dept.Lendio was frustrating to work with with because of this problem. In addition its rare that anyone responds to any E-mails you send them. I could have got a home loan quicker that working with Lendio.I will never use Lendio again, I will never recommend Lendio to anybody and I will discourage people to use Lendio.",1
I hate to ding Lendio because my first…,I requested a loan for the amount of 2.5 times my monthly income in 2020 as the law establish and I received less than 50% of the amount. Now I am trying to contact any person in Ready Capital to know what they gave me lees than money and it is impossible.,1
Almost impossible to get a response,"I had a bad experience with the PPP first draw, small business, I applied on Feb 8 2021 uploaded all documents , waited , about to close my business, no one reply no one answered calls no updates , till I filed a complaint , early March a manger helped , told me to wait a little more so that I get more money after the changes to the law which will make the loan based on Gross income not the net income , I signed a new contract and in one week I received the loan based on the net as per the old contract and I lost 40% of what I was supposed to receive as per the updated law,I contacted them they said (THATS IT WE CANNOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT).worst service ever",1
Very slow response and no live person…,I am extremely disappointed with my loan because I did not receive the whole amount that I was qualified for even after I reapplied I still get less then what I was supposed to receive.,2
3 months no funds.,"Rating Lendio one star is too high! Terrible customer service! An Easter egg hunt trying to figure out what “critical” documentation is missing. At one point I found out they were reading the wrong date in the SoS certification. Application was supposedly compete and with the lender. For reasons unknown to me, my PPP package gets passed from Dave McGuinness to Nicole Sprague. That opened a can of worms since she needs to review everything. Obviously not a smooth handoff. I'm still trying to determine between these two who is more incompetent! Right now it's a coin flip! I was invited to apply for the PPP via Lendio by The Hartford. What a mistake I made getting involved with this company!Reply that I was approved...BIG DEAL! You still suck!!!",1
my income in 2019 was more than 75…,Terrible. I don’t have the desire to give you more feedback.,1
We never spoke to an actual person,"Terrible communication, never received my loan and now I get tons of spam... Do not use Lendio.",2
It was the worst company ever,"They were not helpful from the very start.  We could not get them to answer our questions or to let us know what was happening during the process.   It wasn't until we threatened to file a complaint with the SBA that we even started getting anyone to respond to the issues.  Apparently they had been receiving information back that they needed from the lender and not sharing that with us and fortunately, we already had an SBA loan number or it could have cost us our funds.  I would never use them again.  They are not professional and do not have their people trained to deal with the processes and procedures that are going on with SBA lending practices.",1
Chaotic and disorganized,The process of applying for the PPP was extremely frustrating. I never got contacted by anyone in regards to the status of my application. There was zero communication. It took over 1.5 months to finally receive the money I applied for.,1
My experience has been ok,"Took over two months to receive funding and process wasn't very transparent. Also was assigned multiple funding managers. The last manager was the most helpful. But their UIUX isn't good. Was asked several times for the same info and I had to resend the same info. (Case in point about their UI, they don't have an inbox system on their site. Messages are single emails directly to your personal email and their emails don't have the typical prior emails for history. So you have to save every single message you receive from them.)Comparatively, I have acquaintances who applied through other platforms/sources and their PPP funding process took three weeks overall.",1
Lendio took over a week to resend…,To many words to type my situation.The amount of hands the application/process goes through is overboard.The system in which it provides updates through the process is vague.I could speak more and more.,1
Took forever,"The PPP loan process was fairly easy. Lendio was responsive during the application process when I had a question. I did not complete the application in one sitting because I had to get paperwork from my accountant. Before I completed the application Lendio representatives followed up. Once I submitted the application, Lendio representatives went silent on me when I inquired about the loan status. I began thinking that I may have given my information to a fraudulent company. I reached out to the Lendio representatives that followed up with me during the application process but no one ever emailed me back. I also called and left messages for them. I then went to the Lendio website and sent a message complaining of the silence and asking for a update. I received a emailed from a Lendio rep. apologizing and stating the application is under review. I emailed that person back, and never received a response. Weeks had passed and I then received a email from Legacy Bank asking me to sign the loan documents. I was reluctant because I never applied with Legacy only Lendio. After a few days, and Legacy email reminders, I then decided to review the documents and honestly was on the defense thinking this might be part of the Lendio fraud. The documents seamed straight forward and harmless so I e-signed. After e-signing Legacy said I would see the bank deposit within 3-days. It did arrive as stated. To sum up my experience with Lendio, I'd give them a 5 star rating on the application process, and a 0 on the status  update process. I hope this feedback results in process changes so other potential borrowers get a little better service.4/12 update- A representative from Lendio called me apologizing for the miscommunication, explaining because of the PPP loan volume applications Lendio has hired temps to keep up with the work load. He explained these temps should have communicated with me on the status of my loan. He did say Lendio was going to review my experience with the representative that was handling my account so that they provide better service. I had some questions about the loan forgiveness process, and he assured me a loan forgiveness office would call me to discuss. Once I hung up the phone, sure enough the loan forgiveness office immediately called explaining the process to me. I'm happy to report Lendio does take their customer service very serious and has been very polite and apologetic. Although I had issue with communications, the Lendio loan process was very easy. I am happy to report Lendio is a quality organization, I recommend them to others.",2
The worst!!!,Terrible customer service. It is impossible to get questions answered because no one ever answers the phone nor do they call you back. I have 4 different people send me a text about my account but when I tried to contact them only one person responded to say that she had no information to answer my question.  I will never use them again.....,1
PPP Loan Frustration,"It was the worst experience, everything started at the  beginning of January finally ended beginning of April,not because Lendio was able to complete the process but because I was able to find the information from the bank that was going to lend the money, and they had to contact Lendio to  put pressure to actually fix the issue that was holding my application. For no reason I would recommend them to anyone.",1
I requested a loan for the amount of…,"4/27/21I canceled my application with Lendio, submitted my application with my First PPP lender and it has already been submitted to the SBA for review.  No need to wait.  I recommend applying directly with banks and not with service agents.4/23/01After speaking to Mr. Pellot, my application went backwards, not forwards.  I was placed in compliance review and then assigned a new representative AGAIN.  I reached out to them by email and I only received a response from the representative once with an ""I will get back to you."". That' it!  I sent them an email to cancel my application.  Fortunately, the lender that issued my first PPP reached out to me letting me know that they are now processing second PPP draws.  ____________________ I'm updating to a three because your representative, Ishmael Pellot, personally reached out to me.  He was transparent and honest, fixed some items that needed to be fixed in the system and assured me the next steps should flow smoothly unless the banks require more documentation.  I will definitely update to a five of I can get my funding sooner than later.-------------After the portal informed that the application was sent to the Lender, now I am getting an email from ANOTHER representative that they could only validate to a lower amount of the loan?

I am extremely disappointed with my…,"While I was able to get my loans it was by far the most disorganized company I've ever dealt with and I would never work with them again! There was one amazing rep, Catherine Schnock, but the rest never got back to me and my application must have been passed to 20 different funding reps as they hired and fired incompetent staff.  I understand these are crazy times but the lack of customer service and clarity was beyond belief.  I'm giving them 2 stars because after 100's of calls and emails I was able to get the funding.  My giess is this review never sees the light of day but I hope management recognizes what star Catherine is and advances her to management where she belongs.",2

That is completely insane, as I stated previously I asked all these question and my agent told me everything would be finalized within two weeks now the process is lingering on, I can’t get any information from you guys but you can flag a comment!! I just need a YES or NO so I can move forward with another lender before the ppp ends! It’s been over a month plus...",1
Terrible communication,Took forever to get a loan. The agent in charge originally basically never responded. Someone replaced her. Then pretty much no one helps out with the loan. They just let it be. I had to be 100% proactive and do it myself.,1
They were not helpful from the very…,"It took way too long. Much longer than the last time just going through Benworth alone.  It seemed as though the right hand didn't know what the left hand was doing.  Had to follow up with them so many times and then different people would take over, but then drop the ball.  Poor Poor Service!  Had to question the funding as it said to pay it back w/ 1%... it's a PPP so there is no need for paypack.  They agreed but apparently that's how their system is set up.",2
The process of applying for the PPP was…,"There is no way to access those documents now. How come you respond to a negative reviews instantly, but you wont respond to 40 emails asking for information?I have sent 30-40 emails over the past 45 days trying to find out who is servicing my loan and have not received 1 response from Lendio.",2
"Received funding, but experience was average if even","hi, it was a great experience thank you",2
To many words to type my situation.,"These reviews are really miss leading, at first communication was excellent then after I received my SBA loan number things changed, can’t get no one on the phone they set me up with Ready Cap who also is not responding, I signed and sent all information they’ve requested and still nothing, it sadness me because the program will end within the next few weeks and I still have nothing, I’ve wasted a month plus waiting on LENDIO and Ready Cap!!! I specifically asked for the timetable and I was told 14 days at the max, I would’ve went with another lender if I knew it would’ve taken this long, thanks to these guys I’m not able to file another loan and I may not even have the opportunity to receive this one!!! Thanks LENDIO",1
The PPP loan process was fairly easy,I was approved for my PPP loan 6 weeks ago and signed all documents and as of today I haven't received the funds on my account.  Ready Capital Bank and Lendio don't care about my requests for updates and the simply stopped replying to me. They both are the worst and don't care about their customers. My funding manager Shayne Gillespie has also stopped answering to me.,2
Terrible customer service,"The process was so  unorganized. It went from desk to desk and no one calls you back.  I had to upload the same information over  and over.   Finally after 9 weeks , my application  was sent to the matched lender. But I only found this out by calling lendio and finally talking to my account manager.  I found out who the bank was and called them myself.  They escalated my application and kept me informed      They had to call Lendio 3 times to finally get it released to them.  The bank I was matched to was able to get the funds to me in a few days.   They were amazing!",1
It was the worst experience,"Unfortunately, the only positive thing I can say about my experience with Lendio is that I did get funded on my PPP loan with SBA. Despite innumerable efforts on my part to determine the status of my loan. I was never provided any feedback from the many different representatives who they listed as being assigned to my case. I therefore was never confident or assured from Lendio that my application would be accepted by SBA and was only from my direct contact with SBA that I even knew that my loan was being reviewed by them. As an example, when I was informed that there was a discrepancy in my routing and account number from my bank that I listed in the application and that it didn't match with my voided check, I was left purely on my own to resolve the matter and at no point despite my repeated efforts was I ever given any assurance that it was resolved until I finally got funded. In short, there was zero response to my inquiries and therefore no customer service that I received on my account from Lendio. I was therefore always frustrated and uncertain about the eventual outcome of my application until the final funding.",1
AWFUL I'm fed up and cancelled my application!,I actually thought they maybe lost my application or I was going to be denied. But just like miracles I received an unexpected email notification to sign my docs I was funded. Thank god and thank you Lendio. Be patient folks and keep an eye on ur emails . Wish everyone the best,1
Lendio is a disaster,I have not got funded the bank gave me the wrong routing number by mistake I updated but no real communication I am showing funded of course but no one will call or send a direct email stating when they will redeposit funds.,1
While I was able to get my loans it was…,Its been over a month and we still haven't gotten funding.  Have signed a contract and everything and was told we would have funding within 10 days and well still nothing.  So the funding in as little as 72 hrs may be true for some but not for us......,2
It wasn't good experience,Horrible! Thanks,1
Lendio really flagged my review but can’t respond with info on my loan....,Lendio has failed to release funds after 20 days. Today is my 20th day since receiving a SBA loan number. The past few days I have reached out to have my sba loan number withdrawn with lendio. I have not received a response from customer support. I completed a review last week on here and no one has yet to reach out and try to help me but they respond to all the good reviews and a handful of bad reviews. I would like the SBA loan withdrawn IMMEDIATELY from Lendio. It's been 20 days and I have no idea who the lender is. Horrible company to work with. don't waste your time. Im planning to file complaints within your states BBB after I finish this review as well.,1
Took forever to get a loan just to have it canceled,I guess all My ducks where in a row . My associates have had nothing but the worst experience. After signing loan docs thinking they are approved. The then get emails asking for more documents. We would assume Lendio would gather that information be for sourcing a lender . Very confusing I say be patient it does takes 2 months . You should not ask people to sign loan documents before they are actually approved . This review is for the team .,1
It took way too long,"I'm very disappointed with the loan application process. I originally completed my PPP application in January, and it's early April and I'm still waiting for information. Communication has been poor and my emails and phone calls have mostly gone unanswered. Today I tried to submit a help ticket and the web contact form is broken. I'm not confident at all that Lendio will be able to process my file and get funding approved for my business. But I've wasted months already and it may be too late to withdraw my application and start over elsewhere.Re: Reply from LendioNo, that's not correct that you were waiting on a response from me. My application was first marked complete at the end of January. An internal issue at Lendio is causing my application to be flagged as incomplete even though I've followed up with MULTIPLE people who have CONFIRMED that it is complete. I'm trying to be as proactive as possible, calling and emailing your office at least every week. But my application is still not moving and seems no closer to reaching the funding stage.",2
I have sent 30-40 emails over the past…,"Right now I am not sure you really want a review from me.  Communicating with you is difficult to say the least.  Many times when I have a question I get some seemingly canned robotic response answering a question I did not ask.  You also need better response times.  Many times I wait days for a response and sometimes no answer comes at all.  Very annoying!!!  And to tell you the truth, the lending partner you recommended me to ""Ready Capital"" isn't any better with their communication with clients.  You might really be rated a 1 1/2 stars.  2 stars is stretching it.",1
my expirience,I went weeks with no correspondence after I was notified I would receive an email the next day my loan officer never responded,2
These reviews are really miss leading,To much late and very low amount. It was funny and I have to return it,1
I was approved for my PPP loan 6 weeks…,"Loan was approved and docs signed on 2/2/21.  Lendio said funded on 2/3/21. Today is 4/5/21.  I never saw a dime and never got answers from Lendio. I did get a ""lotta"" ""wait a few more days"" tossed my way though.  I guess 62 days (and counting) is a few to these guys.*************************************************************Reply:i.e., ""wait a few more days"".  Gotcha.",1
Horrible customer service,"Our Funding manager changes 7 times within our application. 12 emails went unasnwered and 4 texts and 11 phone calls. We eventually got the capital, but were left with almost zero answers for the questions we had. We also never found out why our loan was less than what was asked for initially- no one was able to speak with us. Disappointed, but we did get funded in the end- hence the 2 stars.",1
Lendio - a Perfect Example of an Online Platform with Zero Customer Service.,"The communication during the process was very poor.  I was assigned several different ""account managers"" during my 6 week saga.  No one seemed to have the authority or knowledge to navigate internally at Lendio.  I'm sure if you have a very standard straight forward application, it's fine, but questions aren't answered, and anything ""non standard"" is a huge problem.  I'd go to a regional/ local branch bank for anything non cookie cutter",1
It was courteous and speedy service.,"Use at your own risk.  I started the process for a PPP loan, the application was pretty good except for a few contradictory requirements along the way.  The problem is I was assigned a SBA loan number 25 days ago and still no funding.  I've called 4 times and been told it would be looked into and I would get an answer back.  No answer.  I may miss out on the PPP program because of the incompetence here.  I'd recommend using a local lender.Update May 24, 2021 - I signed my documents over 2 months ago.  Still no funding.  No one will answer my calls.  Despite the response saying my issue was escalated nothing has happened.  I would advise staying well clear of Lendio.",1
I actually thought they maybe lost my…,WE signed a agreement on Feb 23rd and called numerous times to find out the status- we finally got a hold of someone and had to redo a document in March around the 15th- people did not return messages and a very frustrating process.Got our money finally and happy their but customer service was not what I would say up to par,1
I have not got funded…Poor Communication,Got us the loan but nearly impossible to maintain communication during the process. Customer service is very difficult to reach and they do not do a good job reaching out during the loan process. I will go elsewhere for future loans.,2
Not pleased,Never completed my PPP loan. Kept giving me the run around and telling me to sign things repeatedly. Bad customer service,1
Awesome experience overall with Lendio,"Lendios employee ( DS ) Did not seem that interested in pursuing our loan for the PPP loan. It took almost four weeks and  many phone calls and e mails from myself (owner ) And my accountant! In the end we did get the loan. I think they are a good company. But in the future I would hate to deal with the aforementioned employee.                       Thomas Cowfer               Silver Dollar Saloon, Inc.",1
Lendio has failed to release funds…,"We are a seasonal employer, & SBA guidelines allow a PPP loan to be calculated on this. We contacted 4 Lendio representatives, including 2 ""supervisors"" about this during the process. Only 1 got back to us. She stated the lender itself determines the amount of the PPP loan. This is totally false. Lendio  processed our PPP loan, & forwarded it to the lender after vetting our loan. We will be receiving about half of our first PPP loan.With only 1 in 4 reps responding, & falsely, & no ""supervisor"" response, we will be losing a good deal of our PPP loan. I do not recommend this company if you need a response or have special needs.",1
It was very easy for me to get funded,I will say flat out that I DID get my funds...HOWEVER Lendio has horrible horrible horrible horrible HORRIBLE communication!,2
I'm very disappointed with the loan…,"Communication regarding the status of the loan application, questions and problems was very poor,  No one to speak with by telephone most time and emails to lender went unanswered most of the time.  Unsure if they received the signed loan contact and if it was countered signed by the lender and if I was going to get the loan until funds were received.  Overall a very frustrating and poor experience.",1
Right now I am not sure you really want…,I spent nearly 2 months trying to get in contact via phone or email with my funding manager. Finally spoke to Brittany that said he was no longer with the company this whole time and she would get things taken care of. Had another person assigned to me...couldn’t get ahold of him either when my DocuSign’s weren’t anywhere in my email. They sent to wrong email! Couldn’t get ahold of anyone to correct. I spent an entire day digging to find out where the lender was. Finally found them (legacy’s bank in Oklahoma). The rep I spoke to there for me the DocuSign tans everything got resolved and I got funded in a matter of a couple of days. The reps from Lendio were absolutely awful! The rep at that bank said the exact same thing. I would never use you all again.,2
I went weeks with no correspondence…,It was extremely hard to get ahold of anyone and yet they manage to have a new person call you every other day asking about you submitting the application if they would work just that hard to help people it wouldn’t be anywhere near that frustrating,1
To much late and very low amount,"I emailed the reps assigned to my loan multiple times about the amount of my loan being low because they changed the rules where I was able to take my loan amount based off my GROSS earnings, and they never got back to me. Just awful service .. will not recommend",1
"""wait a few more days""",One of they Leander’s is ready cap and there absolutely horrible,1
Our Funding manager changes 7 times…,"If I could give negative stars I would have.  The complete lack of communication and follow-up was absolutely appalling.  I signed up with Lendio after I saw one of their ads saying they would fund my business in as little as 24 hours after submitting a complete application.  Well it took 6-7 weeks to fund my business.  Being afraid that funds would run out, I applied immediately to the PPP program.  After multiple enquires to Lendio, I finally was told that a bank they partner with had my application for funding.  When I called that bank they said Lendio was holding up the process.  When I called Lendio back with that info they just said my application was in process and pointed the finger back at the bank.  Eventually they stopped responding to my pleading emails and phone calls.  No communication - period!  I even complained to the Utah Better Business Bureau(BBB).  Funny enough - they responded to my BBB complaint within a few hours and said a representative would reach out to me.  Again, this was false because no one EVER reached out to me. I FINALLY received funding 3/27 just a few days shy of the deadline.  My application was complete - because it was processed without any additional information.  Needless to say - this whole experience was extremely stressful and took a lot of my time away from my company.  Stay clear of this nightmare scenario and use an alternate company for your funding needs!",2
Not a great option for anything you need guidance on,"This review and rating is provided during pandemic. Whether the pandemic conditions impacted Lendio, is for you to decide. Lendio provided a competent platform to apply for the loan. Unfortunately the people and follow up were almost non existent and the platform was not updated to accurately reflect the status of the loan. I would not use this company again, if I had a choice.",2
Use at your own risk,"Mysterious process. Would not have gotten approved if I did not call a dot everyday. Web portal lacks the updates that are needed to successfully understand what is happening. The customer service people are very friendly, I never got to speak with my “funding manager” even though they asked me to call them to share information multiple times.",1
WE signed a agreement on Feb 23rd and…,"I will never go through lendio again, lendio made this experience take an eternity.  Paperwork was easy to fill out but. No one would get back to me regarding how long the process would take.  Hopefully I never need another ppp loan but if I do I will use a local bank.",2
Customer service is not customer driven,Awful experience.... I got approved but didn’t get funded !!!!!,2
Just horrible,Hi Jade here.. after waiting a month to sign the documents for my ppp21.. my funds were returned to sender.. due to the fact I had to immediately close my bank account because of a scammer/hacker..Lendio reached out to ask for alternative banking information which I gave.. but I’m assuming that my alternative account that’s been open and used for only 6mos or so wasn’t good enough.. I say this because after I sent the requested documents for the alternative account.. Lendio STOPPED responding to my emails which is just plain rude ..&  STILL no funds! With only a week or so away from the program ending.. I give up! Smh,1
Lendios employee ( D S ) Did…,"Not a positive experience.  Our loan was supposed to be 3.5 times average payroll because we are a hotel, but they approved us for the original 2.5 times payroll.  I worked on getting this fixed 3 times per week with Lendio for two months and could not get anywhere with them.  They kept sending me loan documents for the smaller loan amount every single day.  Eventually, we just accepted the lower loan amount and it funded.  So as long as everything goes perfect, they will fund your loan.  However, if you have any issue, there is zero customer service to correct those issues.",2
Not recommended,As of today I spoke with a chat agent on lendio I explained too them that my portal still says funded an I have yet too be funded it’s been over 3 weeks I also explained an sent screenshots of my situation with ReadyCap.ReadyCap Lending has emailed me an stated they will not move forward with my application an they released my sba number saying I should apply elsewhere lendio had no knowledge of ReadyCap releasing my sba number an stating they will not be moving forward with my application I need answers an help I’m about to loose my business also lendio stated they sent everything over too my funding manager an supervisor so they can reach out too ReadyCap an see what is going on also the chat agent from lendio said they will try too get me a replacement lender I need help an answers,2
I will say flat out that I DID get my…,Confusion and delay have marked this process. I continue to wait for the outcome despite the lack of response to my inquiries and duplicated steps.,1
Communication regarding the status of…,Terrible communication and customer service,2
Awful and unprofessional,"While Lendio may have a good rating on this website, it goes without saying these reviews are likely not genuine, or they're whitewashed to remove bad reviews. Take a look at the Lendio Twitter threads and other reputable consumer sites, and you'll find dissatisfied clients just like myself. The communication and customer service are atrocious, and they've run afoul of the PPP loan guidelines with the lenders they're allegedly working with to secure loans, bypassing the SBA guidelines of funding loans 21 days after SBA Loan number assignment.It's been weeks since applying for a PPP 2nd draw loan, and the communication about where one is in the process is non-existent. Additionally, I'm in my second month without the funds for my small business. I'm starting to believe some of these secondary lender services are not very reputable, and it's a quick way for companies to attempt to cash in and take advantage of small business owners.If you have access to a community bank, specifically one you do business with, use the bank.  I think we're going to find that groups like Lendio stifled small businesses from securing the loans we needed during the pandemic because they waste valuable time and work with less than credible lenders. *Update since my original post*Lendio attempted to report this post as not genuine, and I was required to provide support documentation to show that I have a business relationship with the organization.",1
It was extremely hard to get ahold of them,"Poor communication, no call backs,and considering there was a timeline to meet. 9 times I tried to reach out to correct the issues and to no avail I was left without answers. If I would have known I could have done the same thing through my own bank , trust me I would have avoided lendio. I didn’t even receive the correct amount for the ppp and I’m probably going to have to shut my business down",2
I emailed the reps assigned to my loan…,IT TOOK 6 TRIES AND YOU LOST THE INFO 5 TIMES IT BECAME A NIGHTMARE. IT TOOK THREE APPLICATION SPECIALISTS WHO CONTINUALLY SAID I DIDN'T HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION IN WHEN I DID. THEY WOULD AGREE EVERYTHING WAS THERE AND THEN A DAY LATER SAY I STILL NEEDED X FORMS. WHICH WHERE THERE. IT WAS A TERRIBLE NAIL BITER. EVENTUALLY ANOTHER BANK GOT ME THE GRANT. I STILL WANT TO APPLY FOR THE SECOND GRANT BUT DO NOT KNOW IF IT IS FEASIBLE OR WHAT TO DO. IF YOU CAN HELP ME I WILL APPLY FOR IT.,1

If I could give negative stars I would…,"I received a reply back from Lendio below regarding this review asking me for more info so they could find me in there system. REALLY LENDIO not only did I provide more info but I also provided additional documents pertaining to my ppp loan. I filed my loan with Lendio on March 8, 2021 and now it is April and not even a dollar has been funded into my bank acct. And every time I call the number that's on the Lendio site that states a so-called supervisor by the name of Phillip Wheel he is NO HELP at all. He tells me the exact same thing over and over and over again. And lied to my ear on the phone that he sent his Manager an email to expedite my loan for me LIAR. All I am asking since I have been waiting since March 8 is for my funds to be deposited. Also, getting back to Philip Wheel he told me he sees where I started an app online on March 14 ( NOT TRUE AT ALL) when I sent him a screenshot of my app showing March 8 and not March 14 he apologizes. Again have no idea what he is doing. If I do not have my funds within the next 7 days I will be contacting the SBA complain attorney general",1
This review and rating is provided…,Lendio processed my ppp loan very slow.. it took a month to see any results while others were taking very little processing time.. Lendio continually changed the needed documents outside of the application. And I still have not received my funds!!,2
Mysterious process,Worst company ever. One representative was rude as hell. She called me on her personal phone blocked and used so much profanity she cursed me out called me b*^%hes. DONT USE LENDIO,1
I will never go through lendio again,"First draw was going fine, 2nd draw horrible nobody helped I lost it because nobody cared to move quick enough so the funds ran out.",1
Awful experience,"No we submitted my email address. But nobody cares. All you care about is getting people funded and getting paid your fees.We could never speak with anyone on the phone. And could never get any detailed responses via email from the rep. Also, I completed the entire application, as President, then all of the signature docs were sent to our Vice president.",1
Hi Jade here.,"I applied for PPP Loan 2 after a very good experience with Lendio for PPP Loan 1. The application was submitted on Jan 24, 2021. It is now March 31 and no funds have shown up. Ready Bank is handling it, as they did last time. But, Lendio has no idea where my money is and they have no way of contacting Ready Bank and tracking it. Worse, they have no contact at Ready Bank for me to get a straight story. I did get to the SBA and they said Ready Bank is funded but Lendio has no clue what's going on. Now they are saying that Ready Bank will be in contact but that has been going on for two weeks. What a joke. Incompetence from top to bottom.",1
Not a positive experience,I have not had a good experience with Lendio! No response for days! I applied months ago!! Note the number for SBA loan isn’t recognized by SBA! I have not being helped by Lendio! It’s making me sick how stressed I am!,1
As of today I spoke with a chat agent…,You all found me a lender and the lender hasn’t sent any funds to me. I don’t know what you all do with people information but that was personal information that I had to send in. I tried to reach Ready Capital and can’t reach anyone there about loan. I called you all and was advised that you all will get back with me the next day once you all had gotten in contact with Ready Capital. No one has called me back or anything. I could had went and tried to get a PPP loan from some where else but unfortunately I can’t because it is over with now. Horrible service. Will not recommend to anyone.,2
Confusion and delay have marked this…,"We spoke with our rep handling, she then changed again and again, there was an issue with the numbers, it was corrected with the supervisor Lawernce and he said it was all corrected and the numbers are corrected. I tried reaching him and my rep, 23 messages and still no Responce. Very dissatisfied.",1
Poor customer service,"They made errors on my loan docs on several occasions and took 11 days to correct them. When they finally corrected them and I signed, my loan did not fund even though the documents were accurate. I then requested new docs which I had to sign three times before they were accepted. My loan then took another 13 days to fund.I emailed/called/texted my loan reps on numerous occasions and received a reply no more than 10% of the time.It was a horrible experience and I would never recommend this company.",2
This company stifles small business,"I appreciate that your company was able to obtain a PPP loan for us. However, there was almost ZERO communication between Lendio and us. The way we knew that the approval had happened was through the SBA. My CPA was working with another lender who approved us for more, and Lendio had already received ""confirmation"" from the SBA, just didn't tell me. So when that bank said ""you've been approved by someone else"", we had to go searching, and figured out Lendio had the approval....",1
Poor communication,"So I got a NO NAME reply back do not know who sent it as they did not even know what my complaint was! SO MR NO NAME I RECEIVED CALL FROM YOUR AGENT DAVE informing me that my application looks good and complete and will move to the next phase SO WHICH PHASE IS THAT? I do not know who is giving LENDIO 5 star review for fast service when they are very slow comparing to BLUE VINE.And now also unprofessional as they replied to me anonymously with giving me any contact information.I applied at LENDIO BACK ON March 24th 2021 and my request is still under review , even though I was called and received an email that my loan was approved and nothing has happened while my other business affiliates had applied with Blue vine and are already funded. Left two messages for DAVE who never returned my calls or email messages. DO NOT USE LENDIO NOR BLUE VINE. BLUE VINE reduces your loan amount by 1/2",1

Applied for ppp loan has been approved,"Lendio has very bad responsiveness.  They do not communicate and there is no one you can talk to on the phone, nor do they reply to emails about status.  Their systems also send you messages about your PPP status that say they haven't heard from you, yet I was checking in with them with all the emails I could find 2x per week.  It took 2.5 months to get funded, but with zero idea of when it would happen AND the deadline was just days away.  If your business really needs these funds, like we all do, it is WAY too stressful to use these guys.",1
I filed my loan with Lendio on March 8,"Customer Service was really bad.  Was unable to contact or it was really hard to contact a Loan Representative, either by email or by phone.  Calls were not returned.  Finally, we were forced to use an Officer at AmEx to contact a person at his level at Lendio to have the funds deposited, more than a month after signing the Promissory Note.  Website was not helpful either.",1
Lendio processed my ppp loan very…,"When I would try and contact the company I was lucky if I would get a response. The time frame for processing everything was months, literally. Within that time frame there was constant spamming trying to get more business out of me or to link me to their social media. Quite the pain to deal with for something that should have been simple.",1
Worst company ever,"If there were negative stars as ratings, even those would be too much for me to rate my experience thus far with Lendio. They are deceptive, provide horrible customer service and spend more time deleting negative comments on their Facebook than attending to the small businesses they have held up in their convoluted business practices. Lendio, along with their partner in crime, Ready Capital, need to be investigated by federal authorities for taking advantage of small business owners and federal dollars. I have reached out several times a day for transparency and get no where. I ask questions, they divert and disconnect chat, or tell me they will get back with me and never do. Run far away from Lendio and Ready Capital as they are not in the business of helping anyone but themselves. Do not buy into the positive comments for them on this forum as they cannot delete them. They likely pay someone to write for them. I have filed complaints and provided my attorney with all of the issues I have experienced. BTW, I have still not been funded and it is past the 10 days in accordance with the law. Lendio tried to send me an email stating I did not provide information when I applied, when I did. I am disclosing this because I believe this is their work around for obtaining an ETRAN number prior to Lendio reviewing applications. They lock you in with them and hold you hostage until they work backwards or you’re lucky enough to have someone fully  cancel the approved SBA loan number. Also, Lendio, don’t say you don’t have record of me, because we both know you do.***added to reply to Lendio’s Reply- no, Lendio, you did not help.",1

Do not use this company hopefully the SBA intervenes with how Ready capital has treated people.  Sorry bunch of clowns.  Update!!!!!

We could never speak with anyone on the…,No communication. Multiple lending managers. It took about 3 months to get funding. Had to call or go on Twitter every week to get a little further each time. Very frustrating as a small business owner waiting for financial help.,2
Terrible PPP 2 Loan Experience,"I applied for PPP2 through these guys - on the same day as my friend applied through BofA.  He was funded 4 weeks before me.  I called and emailed for updates and just to make sure they had my application.  NOTHING.  I kept receiving emails to sign something but there was nothing to sign.  They claim that they respond to every email but the reality is that their responses are automate requests for signatures OR to tell you that they'll be in touch.  So, the answer that they get back to you is misleading.  Another reason to avoid this company.  Also, yes, I was funded - MONTHS after other companies with same day applications - see note about BofA...sigh - still Lendio trying to obfuscate and mislead with their response.I will never use this service again -",1

A representative (Rae Mcroy) reached out letting me know he was submitting to lenders. I continuously emailed Rae and got no response. On 3/20 I applied elsewhere but was pushed back because they told me I had a loan elsewhere. I log into Lendio and see a loan number. I hadn't been contacted by anyone. I then created a caweb account and see that Ive had the loan number since 3/18. I immediately reached out to the funding manager, customer support and Rae. It is now 3/29 and I have not gotten an updates, a response to emails nor have I received a call. This is ridiculous.I have not even been notified of who my lender is. Do not use Lendio.

Horrible experience - Loan funded 42 days after approval - Many mistakes and no communication,"Lendio was helpful at first when my process started in August 2020. I had a great representative who was there anytime and answered questions. He took all required information. Little did I know this process would drag on until March 2021. Multiple times submitting information because it was ""misplaced"" or ""filed incorrectly"" and my account changed hands more times than I care to even mention. I was contacted by text more often than by phone call and often those messages made little to no sense and when I tried to actually speak with someone at one point I was told that a State issued ID card was not acceptable when all Federal agencies even accept this. I was met by rude and unsupportive people at Lendio every time I turned around and finally they found a lender for me who had everything done in a matter of 48 hours. Not so sure I recommend Lendio until they get people who are willing to stay with the company and maintain the accounts better instead of passing them around like a hand of cards.",1

If you’re not in a hurry,Customer service with our rep was horrible!  She never answered the phone but would send an email immediately after we left a message on her voice-mail.   It was horrible to get through to someone about questions...,1
"Horrible customer service, no communication.  Will not use again.",I applied for a ppp loan back on 3/8 the application process was seemless and pretty easy and straight forward. I was told of new sba guidelines that allowed businesses to qualify for a larger amount using the gross annual income and the ability to refinance an edil loan. I resubmitted the updated application with updated information as requested.  I was told that by application officer Dawn B that my application was sent to sba and the updated application was all they needed so I submitted it. Dawn B is amazing and actually cares to explain your application in detail. But then I was switched to Ronald P who is my financing officer and it’s impossible to get in touch with him regarding my application. Even though he was the one to initial tell me to update my application he never informed my lender that all information was up to date and for my application to be resubmitted to the sba. Now time is running out for the ppp loan application which is said to close 3/31 since it has not been officially extended. If I had known that the process would have been such a headache I would have tried other lenders I simply want my application to process and funds to dispersed into my account so I can keep my business afloat. At this point I’m not sure what to do because if you are that swamped and can’t process all applications then simply inform me and I will gladly look for another lender that can fund my business. The lack of communication and transparency is what frustrating. This is the first ppp loan I’ve applied for and it’s horrible I’ve had friends apply through blueacorn weeks after me and their application has already been sent to sba and assigned a loan number so I’m soo confused what the issue is with lendio and my lender is very disappointing.,1
Very poor communication if they have…,"Months!!! Still Nothing! This Company is a complete joke!! Stay away...you will be assigned so many different""Managers"" in which all will have you summit the same EXACT Documents over an over an over smh..BTW if you request for you application to be withdrawn they will ABSOLUTELY NOT RELEASE UR SBA # in which will NOT ALLOW You to apply to somewhere else! The government needs to step in NOW! What a let DOWN!",1
Poor communication- Not Funded after 10 days of receiving SBA loan #,"I applied although and got approved with SBA loan number. DID NOT RECEIVE THE FUNDS and have no clarity on when I'll be receiving them, I've sent follow up messages and they'd give me replies saying that there is a dedicated team working on my 'issue' and that someone in the team will be reaching out to me soon, although 3 days passed and nothing. Very disappointing. I'd suggest applying with bluevine. I applied with them the first PPP and nothing went wrong everything went smoothly with no fallouts.Reply to Lendio: Be mindful. My SBA loan got approved March 1st. It is March 29th, You have passed 10 days and yet NO FUNDS.",1
The worse service I have gotten in a…,No one answer the phone. Poor customer Service,1
Could Do Better,"I recently applied for a PPP loan with Lendio. At first, the process took some time but it was due to new government guidelines that delayed all the paperwork. After that, everything ran smoothly until they assigned a lender to my application: Ready Capital. A couple of days later Ready Capital emailed me with a link to a DocuSign contract because my application was approved and they only needed my signature in order to fund my account within 72 hours. 72 hours later nothing happened. After contacting them via email I was told that the funds would reach my account within two weeks and then they sent another email saying 10 business days. I talked to a Lendio representative and he told me that these funds, in fact, take 10 to 15 days to be deposited into the borrower's account. And then I waited. Two days ago a received a new email from Ready Capital stating that my credit was denied due to “high-risk activity associated with the information/documentation provided with my PPP Application”.I was really surprised and upset after this email. I wrote them back saying that this was clearly a mistake but so far I haven't received any answer from them. I wrote Lendio another email explaining the case and no reply either. Then I started searching online about Ready Capital and to my surprise, the reviews here in TrustPilot were terrible (86% negative) and the word ""scam"" is everywhere. Not only that. The story is the same for everyone: they approve your application, they receive the SBA number, they make you sign a contract because your application is approved and days later they ""discover"" a reason to deny your credit (one of the reviews is exactly the same story as mine)Why would they make you sign a contract if the application is not approved? Shouldn't they review the application first and make you sign a contract later, after everything checks out? Isn't this a little suspicious? My guess is that they make you sign a contract so the SBA releases the funds to them and later they deny your application in order to keep the money. I don't know why Lendio keeps choosing Ready Capital as a lender. It's clear that their business practices are questionable and I would dare to say illegal. And this doesn't make you look good either. In fact, if I get the chance to have Ready Capital cancel my SBA number (good luck with that), I won't even think about reapplying with you.Thanks,Francisco Oduber",2
LENDIO WAKE UP YOUR PARTNER READY CAP AND TELL THEM TO GET ON THINGS,"My first round of ppp went great, second round was not. It’s been 30 days since I signed my DocuSign note and the lender has not funded our loan. I get the same run around by all parties.",1
Unpresented experience,"I applied with Lendio on 3/14/21. I received my ppp loan number /e-Tran # on 3/18/21. After that no more communication. I called no answer, I emailed no reply. I made a post on Facebook and someone sent me a private message saying that I was not approved (on Facebook!!) so I login my account to check the status of my application and it’s says under review still, I login in SBA website and I still have the same e-Tran #. I check back a week later everything still say the same. At this point I feel like this company is fraud and holding me hostage. If you guys decided not to approve me but showing an active e-Tran # and never contact me to officially to tell me I’m not approved you are holding me up from applying and getting approved elsewhere. Because it’s showing that I have an active loan just haven’t been disbursed yet, meaning that the funds has been set aside for me leaving me stuck and can’t apply elsewhere. I don’t understand Why is it taking so long to officially tell me I didn’t qualify. I just want to move on to another lender before funds run out and I can’t. I feel defeated and don’t know what to do. You guys supposed to help small business and I haven’t been help at all. I just want to move on.Lendio, how did you reach out to me? I haven’t received a email or phone call. What do you mean find my account on your system? SMH so now you can’t find my account?",1
As of today March 28th I have yet too…,I applied over one month ago and still have no information. I can’t even get anyone to respond to me to tell me the status of my loan. I have received contracts multiple times to sign and I don’t know what is going on. Terrible customer service.,2
The lack of communication appalling,"Horrible  experience with Ready capital ,I was SBA approved  loan docs signed two months ago .I cant get funded yet it's been two months I corrected my banking information for them to send the funds to because they used the wrong routing number .its been a month now cant reach anyone to speak to them .They definitely Forgot about me or my application  is just sitting there while they work on other ones I will never do business again with Lendio because they paired me with ready Capital who is very unprofessional. I do not know why lendio uses ready capital there is so many bad reviews if I saw this in the beginning I would of not wasted my time. I WOULD HAVE GONE WITH  WOMPLY OR SOMEONE ELSE .HORRIBLE  EXPERIENCE!!This is the only ppp provider with so many bad reviews and there is a common denominator  here and the volume of bad reviews speak for it self .",1
"The process was very fast, but",I got this email saying rate Lendio but i have yet to receive any funds. They is playing got to be,2
1)The assigned loan manager is not…,Working with Lendio to get my first round PPP has been terrible.  I understand delays but after 2 full months I still don’t have any money and cannot get anyone to respond to me.  I will never use them again nor recommend them to anyone I know. Their reply said they reached out to me but all I got was a generic automated text and email with no substance whatsoever. No one is getting back to me with what the hold up really is.  What a joke.  There are many other lenders doing PPP loans out there. My suggestion is to Contact someone else.,2
BEWARE OF FRAUD,"They replied saying they reached out, they never did and never will. They post that to make others think they do. Suppose to be reached out by at least 4 supervisior already and here it is 2 weeks later.. nothingOne of the worst, applied for the PPP but i told them i wanted to wait before moving forward because there was going to be an option where you can choose line 7 instead of line 31 in your schedule C. We waited and as soon as it was passed, i called them and they had me send documents and had me choose line 7 and so forth. Then i ended up not getting the line 7 but was offer line 31 and lendio had no idea what happened and said i did everything right and they have no idea what happened, after that they just ignored my phone calls and emails, even when i called corporate, they dont care. They tell you they will let their supervisor know and will contact you soon but they never do. They screwed me over and they ignore you after that, not just the agents but the corporate themselves, they dont care if you’re business and employees are suffering, they make a mistake and they ignore you after that, they dont try to fix it or compensate. Everyone told me to go to this other person and i should of listen but i didnt and went with lendio. So everyone else please listen to me and avoid lendio before you get screwed over like i did. No matter who i talked to they always ask what my business is, which is a nail salon and end up ignoring me, i wonder why.",2
I got approved for a amount and didn’t…confused,"Although our loan were approved and we received the loan, they are very poor in communication. We could never get a hold of them over the phone, they also never answered their emails.",2
Sorry Could NEVER Recommend Lendio,"This process took 2 months. No one would ever correspond with us, answer questions, or give us an update.  I would never recommend this company to anyone.",1
Customer service with our rep was…,"It has been such a long drawn out process with Lendio. I started the application immediately and had to edit it multiple times with little help from their team. Their instructions were confusing and I could never get a customer service rep that would assist me through the whole process it was always 3 to 4 different people. I signed my paperwork for funds almost a month ago now and still have yet to receive my funds. I have reached out multiple times and their answer is ""they have no idea when I will receive"".. which is frustrating to say the least. I wish I did not go with this platform and am worried I will never receive my funds.Their response below is incorrect. I signed on 3/2. I am not sure what they are referring to with this 3/17 date but even 10 business days later I have still not received. This process has been extremely frustrating & I would be very cautious about working with them as it has taken months since I first began their application process.UPDATE: 4/5 - I still have yet to receive funds. I have reached out to three customer service reps and have received ZERO response.",1
What’s the hold up,I did not have a good experience with this company. You can never get on the phone with anyone they never answer any questions and it took forever to get my PP loan. They promised one amount and I did not receive that amount is $900 that were not giving to me and I can’t get in touch with anyone to talk about this $900,2
DO NOT! DO BUSINESS WITH LENDIO!!,Lendio did not process my PPP themselves. They refered me to another company and i had a bad experience. I will not recommend.,1
Approved PPS NO FUNDS!!!,"I applied for a ppp loan over two months ago and docusigned Feb 19 fot 15 k and again on 3 16 for 3,783 and contacted russ my manager at lendio. He was to get back to me but did not. I still have not had money deposited in my account.Bentworth is the lender you hooked me up with and last week THEY canceled my loan NOT ME and told me they would have more money for me than originally signed for in 2 to 3 days that was last Tuesday 10 days ago.They are going with Womply not lemdio and I still don't know what  happened, now I'm in limbo.I called your company everyday for weeks and was told so many different stories regarding funding. I have no faith in your company any more due to the lack of customer service.Do you always ignore you clients?So now what are my options its been a very stressful experience. Its 4-9 and I still have not received any funds.James GosselinHalf Moon Bay Ca 94019650 416-4089",2
No one answer the phone,"I only gave it one star because ""0"" wasn't an option.  Lendio approved me for a PPP loan and sent the documents for that amount, which we both executed.  They then only partially funded, about 58%, of the agreed upon amount.  I was finally able to make contact after over a dozen calls, and they acknowledged they made a mistake but had not idea if or when they would rectify and have dodged all calls and e-mails since.   This is an organization with no credibility or integrity.  They just don't care about their clients, simple as that!",1
SBA PPP Loan nightmare,"My journey started January 20th. The day PPP Round 2 opened. I was very well prepared and had my documents ready as well. I was approved for my SBA Loan on March 6th with Lendio by Ready Capital. I didn't find out until a week later until I logged into my Caweb account and seen that the loan was approved for my business.I immediately contacted Lendio. They didn't know I was approved either. My dashboard was saying Application Withdrawn. I sent a message to the chat and I was informed that my Application was not withdrawn and that the SBA did approve my loan.I was immediately assigned another Funding Manager (I think I've had 15) Molly was really nice and she apologized for me getting ""lost in the system.""Molly forwarded my over to Kyle. I was really happy to start seeing things moving since I'm currently at 2 months and 5 days since I submitted my application.I passed the First Verification phase. I was then told that I would be receiving my Closing Documents from Ready Capital.This was March 15th. Then I was asked to provide another round of verification documents AGAIN. It seemed like random documents since they aren't required by SBA but I had the documents already submitted back in January.I'm well beyond the 10 day funding rule by the SBA. And I'm one day away from the 20 day rule by the SBA as well. It's day 19 and I'm doing EVERYTHING in my power to get my closing documents.It's a scary feeling knowing that you're ONE day away from the SBA funding deadline once you're already approved - and you haven't received your Closing Documents.I've been proactive and making sure that I also speak to Ready Capital as well. I applied the first day PPP Round 2 opened to get a head start and now there are 6 days left until PPP closes.I want to give this company 5 stars but it's been an extremely long, strange, weird and drawn out process. We have Employees that we are looking out for and the anxiety experienced was just unbearable.Receiving the Closing Documents today will be great. Please advise.(Update) A month later, Lendio sent an automated email with our SBA Loan Number stating we were denied funding. We were funded our PPP Loan already from another company. Lendio dropped the ball and pushed it on to their ""customers"" - they did this to thousands of small business owners. Shame. We won't forget.",1
My first round of ppp went great,Filling out the application was easy however the process after that was pretty long and mysterious.  I tried several times to get ahold of someone at lendio and wasn't able to ever get a real person on the phone.  If I missed a call from them I wasn't ever able to connect with them in regards to why the loan hadn't been funded.  I was approved with a loan number and then didn't get funded until 6 weeks later.  I would not recommend this process to someone who needs money fast and wants live communication. If you're laid back and don't really care about the timeline this would work for you.,1
I applied with Lendio on 3/14/21,"Too many change of people in charge. No response to request about what is going on and when they do, they are not happy to be asked! It is MY MONEY.",1
I applied over one month ago and still…,"Doesn't take a genius to realize that most of the recent reviews that are positive seem kinda fake and the negative ones give a lot of detail and seem more truthful. If your like me and went through lendio because your Google search for best ppp loan companies said they were number 1 raise your hand. Now did you file like me and sign edocs then came to read reviews lol. Well, we all live and learn. Yup, filed back in February recently just got word to finish some unfinished parts and got APPROVED by ready capital. Now just getting the run around. This is horrible and smells really fishy. Nothing we can do at this point though 😟. Good luck. Stay away from this company if you can.",1
Horrible  experience with Ready capital…,"LENDIO RESPONDED TO THIS REVIEW AND CLAIMED TO HAVE REACHED OUT TO ME. ITS A LIE. THEY DID NOT. NO ONE REACHED OUT. NOT A MISSED CALL, AN EMAIL, NOTHING! This is my 2nd review. Lendio and Ready Capital are both lost with funding. I have been waiting on a deposit since March 3, 2021. I have been waiting on an answer about funding since March 8th. No one at Lendio has an answer, no one at Ready Capital has an answer. I have not been funded. My bank has not received, rejected or recovered any wirings or deposits into my account. My business has been depending on Lendio since early February. The beginning process with Lendio intake was unorganized and messy. This isn’t fair to business owners. Lendio and Ready Capital is neglectful and just as confused as the public.",1
I got this email saying rate Lendio but…,Lack of communication and when Lendo reps do respond it's clearly canned responses they are just copying pasting. Very clear this is a a huge call center with high school students or immigrants working there. No knowledge of what they are actually processing. After my submission there were 5 emails I sent to just 1 email received from the rep who said I need to submit a SSC. He never responded to me on what that was. Then the rep abruptly changed to someone else. Clearly high turnover with un knowledgeable staff.,1
Unhappy customer,"The first PPP done by Lendio was excellent and very quick. For the second one, it was a total mess. There were too many lenders sending us messages and email which were very confusing. Lendio was totally unreachable and never responded to queries.M. Ranchhod.ONSITE.",1
One of the worst,"Lendio paired me with a lender who got my loan initially funded. However, a technical glitch with the funding is currently preventing another loan. Lendio passes me to the lender, the lender passes me to the SBA, the SBA passes me to Lendio and the cycle continues. After multiple requests for a call from a supervisor, nothing has happened. Lendio just provided a response that all funds needed to be utilized prior to requesting a second draw. Again, missing the entire point. The funds have already been used, but I still cannot apply for Draw 2. My review will still remain poor.",1
Poor Communication,I was lied to and I got the wrong amount on my PPP even though I was told it would be fixed.,1
This process took 2 months,I got a email I entered all my info it said within 72 hours it would be funded it has been over a week and my loan still has not posted on my account.,1
It has been such a long drawn out…,The uploading of documents was easy. The talking with a lender was almost non-existent when I had questions. Response time to emails was slow and there was never a call back from the lender to any voice mails left. I am still looking for the instructions on who I am suppose to send the forgiveness form  for the PPP loan.,1
I did not have a good experience with…,This was for a round 2 PPP loan.  Website application was confusing and hard to navigate.  Uploads were confusing.  I was asked to provide documents that had already been uploaded.  Approval and processing time was slow.  Funding was slow.My round 1 PPP loan with a different lender was far easier.  I had approval within 2 days of application submission and funding within 24 hours of docusigning.,1
Bad experience,I have contacted the funding manager twice and she still has not gotten back to me.,1
I applied for a ppp loan over two…,"Never replied to a single email. Sent form emails made out to the wrong name. Very difficult to get a hold of a real person, and hard to have confidence the person was giving me real info when I finally did get someone. They were just overwhelmed--sending out auto-generated emails with wrong info, then it was difficult to get to the bottom of what was really going on. There are some good people who work here, but I will not work with them again.",2
"I only gave it one star because ""0""…",I have had a horrible experience with Lendio during my second draw.  My funding manager Michael Lubin has never contacted me and I have left several voice and emails.,1
Stressful Long Process - Disaster!,The communication is horrible my status has been in Funded status for over a week still no funds or explanations. They won't give me straight forward answers. I don't recommend Lendio at all.,1
Communication was an issue,"What a terrible company to work with. I had a loan in process with them, they updated me that they were going to need some additional documentation but my loan was approved, and then that's the last I've heard of them. It's been 3 weeks, no response to emails, their phone numbers never ring to a real person, and laura williams and chris colucci who are involved on my account have proven to be a massive disappointment in their failure to even respond to me. What a frustrating and nerve-racking experience to need a loan, know that it got approved, and yet your loan representative(s) won't even reply to you. I can't think of a worse experience to have with a lender. How does a company like this even stay in business.....I'm willing to update this review if I finally hear from my lender representative, but I doubt I will hear from anyone based on their lack of response and customer service so far.",2
Too many change of people in charge,"I really didn't want to post this review and actually gave them the opportunity to reach out to me, which they still haven't done. This was just an awful experience once the application had been completed, they kept telling me it was ok but then they said more information was needed, I was given different contacts who never called or emailed back. I was getting concerned that perhaps fraud was occurring since I could not find out what was happening with my application and there was nobody to talk to. The process took a really long time, much longer than the timelines in the FAQ's.In response to their response, I did reply to them and again no one got back to me. The 10 days was more like 2 months, and I didn't feel the need to respond to the congratulations email. I did also respond to the request for this review, and said that they really didn't want me to write a review, and again, no response. So they sent me a reminder to write my review and here we are.",2
Doesn't take a genius to realize that…,"Communication was non-existent.  The process took over 8 weeks when I had colleagues getting applications submitted and funded within 5-10 days.  Taking that long, and never having phone calls or emails returned was unnerving. I was constantly worrying if I should be submitting my application somewhere else.  Once it was in the final process of approval I received and email telling me to ""hurry up"" and sign the documents before my SBA Loan expired.",1
Neglectful Company,"I’ve tried getting a hold of customer service with hardly any luck. When I do get help nothing is accomplished. My loan has been showing as funded but I’ve received nothing and no one seems to care. *update*** it is now the 23rd of March and I still have not received any funding.** UPDATE**It is officially March 26th, the 10th business day since I was “approved for funding” and I still have not received anything. I was told 72 hours once I signed my loan papers, which was very apparently false. No one can answer me as to why I haven’t received the funds yet instead they pass the buck onto the next person. This is the worst experience ever.",1
Lack of communication and when Lendo…,"Two months of mistakes, accidental mistake loan denial emails, they submitted to lender twice incorrectly, incorrect calculations and change in loan manager four times. Their inexperience, carelessness and lack of initiative almost cost me the PPP and potentially the loss of my business. The stress i went through on the daily with them had me physically sick. I’ll never use them again.",2
The first PPP done by Lendio was…,"I spoke to several different people on numerous occasions and got help with my PPP loan. Then I heard nothing back. Then I got a phone call saying that they were waiting for me to sign my contract, when I had not received an email with that contract. The woman said she would email me everything again immediately and then nothing happened. I asked her for her information she said don't worry I will email you everything as soon as we hang up the phone and that's when all communication stopped with lendio. That was about two weeks ago.",2
Lendio paired me with a lender who got…,"It was good, service is excelanat lots of verification, its help each individual like us , overall good",1
Not as trustworthy as they say,"I was told funds were dispersed 3 different dates and still haven’t received anything.Update: After following the suggestion of the response, still no funding after 14 days of the dated provided nor was any additional follow up provided.",1
I got a email I entered all my info it…,Time lapse to long between receiving information on loan process. Lendio switches to many account managers during the process it hard to know who is actually handling you account. Had to contact the actual bank to push the process through. Would not suggest using if you are in need of getting your fund in a reasonable time line.,1
Service and Answers,Your process take to long no reply’s no answer ect.,2
Poor,Great follow thru but it took a lot longer than it should have. The up side is they were in touch with me at every step. Thanks Ledio,1
I have contacted the funding manager…,Impossible to reach customer service. Kept getting emails requesting documents that were not required. Finally got funded but after many many months,2
Never replied to a single email,Non responsive. Told loan was funded 1 month ago nothing yet,2
Horrible experience with Lendio,"25 years self employed, several businesses loans , Going through Lendio as the loan broker for my 2nd round PPP was a serious mistake, It has been the utmost frustrating loan process to date",1
The communication is horrible my status…,They asked the wrong person for a review.  This company has been terrible .  They have sent me papers to sign many times which I did.  Then they tell me I should have my loan in my account within 72 hours.  I have been waiting over 4 weeks.   Then they turn me over to another company which I still an waiting to be funded.  Don't waste your time dealing with them they suck.,1
What a terrible company to work with,"Things started out well with Lendio, they kept the pressure on to get all paperwork ready to submit so that when applications opened they could submit. We got thru that process and they were great. Then it came time to submit, we ended up with a new person of contact it seemed like every other day. They started requesting paperwork they already had. It seemed like daily we were getting requests for the same paperwork requested by the previous point of contact. We would get an email stating everything is good to go and the next day that they wanted more paperwork(which they already had) trying to get someone on the phone was near impossible and the only way I did get in contact with them was finding a link on their Facebook page to ask questions. I’d have to say the experience was terrible especially during such stressful times and never knowing what was going to happen next. We would receive a confirmation letter stating we are approved and good to go, then receive an email requesting more info once again, then an email stating our application is rejected and then another email stating it’s going to fund. I never leave reviews on anything but this one I had to. I don’t think they were prepared for the volume of applications they took on. I think they got buried and short staffed. I hate to leave bad reviews any where but the issues we dealt with were insane to the point we reapplied with another company only to get an email that we were approved and funding. So with drew that app only to get an email stating it was rejected. In the end it got done but their customer service sucks",1
I really didn't want to post this…,"They totally messed up my ppp 1st somehow I went from getting 23900 but through some sort of mistake from their end from getting 23900 to 5000 pretty disappointed is to say the least and I was told it was going to be escalated to a manager and basically nothing has happened since. I am ready to take my business elsewhere I got a message they do not even realize nothing has posted or been issued yet to do date. Seems your unable to give a strait answer on what needs to be done. I should have gone through my own bank in first place. If lendio wants review adjusted get back to me and tell me whats,what instead of a complete lack of communication. I call in and I can never get ahold of a single person, my agent is switched three times and I can never seem to reach anyone.",1
Communication was non-existent,"I took nine months and six Lendio agents but I was eventually funded so that’s worth one star. Each agent would tell me I was approved and funding was on the way, then would disappear and a new agent would contact me to say my application was not complete. The communication was so poor that I’m sure it was planned that way. Don’t know why they play that game but as you can see from their reviews it doesn’t lead to customer satisfaction.",1
Worst company ever,It was the most horrendous experience. I would not use Lendio again,1
Worst experience,I applied for a loan through lending which sent it to ready capital. It said my funds were approved and dispersed but I never saw a dime . I’ve checked with my bank multiple times and nothing . Last week they said funds were rejected from my bank which never happened m. Still haven’t received my ppp and it’s hurting me and my business . Terrible,1
I spoke to several different people on…,"Process took way longer than necessary;Hooked us up with a lender, Ready Capital, who still hasn’t funded our loan and refuses to communicate with us. This has been going on for over 2 months;I have colleagues who went from application to fully funded in 15 days (using other platforms). This has been a complete joke.",1
It was good,Poor communication.  Kept on requesting the same information. every time l logged on there was a different contact person.,2
I was told funds were dispersed 3…,"Poor timeliness, loses prior supplied documents, had to go elsewhere",1
Would not use again not very organized,Could never get in touch with nobody Hard to get loan No one never  called back or responded Unprofessional,1

Great follow thru but it took a lot…,"We completed our PPP application on 2/26/21, it wasn't reviewed until 3/2 and I could not reach anyone at the contacts given.  A different person on the application randomly received an email from a different lending source (through the Lendio application) but since it was not the person who applied we were not sure if it was spam.  We completed the docusign on 3/8 and still have not received funds.  Today is 3/19/21.  I finally received an email from someone at Lendio AFTER the docusign was completed but they never replied again despite multiple attempts to reach them.",2
Impossible to reach customer service,It has been 38 days since my loan was approved with the SBA. The lender is Ready Capital. They are not sending it.And Lendio can’t do anything to help me. What a joke.,2
Non responsive,"At the beginning, getting a PPP loan didn’t sound so bad especially with companies like Lendio claiming that it’s a fast and easy process. However, that wasn't my case. I uploaded my application sometime around January. A month later (Feb 5), I received my SBA number. Then I get an email from my funding manager saying that my lender wants to me to update my application, which I did and she gladly sent it to the lender. This is where it started to go down hill. I couldn’t log into my account so I called and emailed multiple times, with no one either responding or not knowing why I couldn’t login. I had to change my password on multiple occasions just to see what was going on and to find that I had no funding manager. It took over a month for someone to even tell me that it was being manually reviewed and that I would hear from someone very soon. After that my account was locked so I couldn’t do anything about it (which I understand but I would have still liked to see the progress). After waiting for so long, I finally hear back from Lendio today saying that they can’t submit my application to the SBA because of funding and validation protocols... I already had my SBA number and it was (and still is) active, my funds just weren’t distributed. I need the loan in order to help pay rent and keep my business going or else I have to move out of my apartment. I’m a college student who is working her hardest to get through school and to keep my business running so I can at least pay for rent. This was the most frustrating and stressful thing I have ever experienced in my life and that’s saying something considering I’m double majoring. Now I'm finding a different lender that can get my funding to me quickly and easily. Lendio you need to fix something or a lot of businesses like mine will suffer more than they are right now.",1
"Many loans , 25 years self employed",They keep lying saying that im lying im being honest they aren't and then they take away my platform to defend myself thwy keep saying they cant get in contact with me well here it is. My business name is Jazzy hair my name is Ireyion Calloway my loan was through customers bank I signed it on February 22 and I haven't received anything Im currently pregnant and in need of a few things pertaining to my business my phone number is 5049006895 my email is Persephoneperry6@gmail.  lets see if they'll call me let see if they call im gonna get the word out because thwy keep getting my review flagged it's defamation of character  scammmmm dont do it .Like I said before horrible service I still haven't received my loan I haven't been contacted by anyone I can't get ahold of anyone but they have the nerve to Flagg my review. If u give me my money I wouldn't have to write a review I been signed my paperwork They cant even answer me and give a decent excuse wow.,1
They asked the wrong person for a…,"The whole experience has been bad. I was referred Lendio by my Payroll company Heartland.  There was an error on loan app, a typo. Emailed so many people to correct no avail sent me papers on a loan for $175.00 to this day no one has reached out. Very unprofessional company. And no one responds but I get emails from various employees I email back nothing.  I own a restaurant I was depending on these funds.  I have considered putting a complaint in to SBA.",1
Things started out well with Lendio,Im constantly asked to sign the same form over and over again. And still no loan. Annoying. Im done. Keep your money,1
They totally messed up my ppp.....,I’m not funded at all I’m about too loose everything I worked hard for Ready Capital Lending I’m not getting no where with them at all all I keep hearing is that it’s in Accountant Department for a review if anything is needed they will email you an here it is today March 18th an the same crap I’m over it can u release my SBA NUMBER SO I CAN APPLY ELSEWHERE BECAUSE AT THIS POINT I HAVE LOSTED HOPE AND BELIEVE I WILL NOT GET FUNDS IN MY ACCOUNT FROM READYCAP LENDING PLEASE RELEASE MY SBA NUMBER PLEASE,1
Abysmal communication,"UPDATE: This company are full of lies!! No one has contacted me, I’ve been sending emails and calling Lendio. I signed documents on 3/3/2021 and have not been funded. They claim to have funded me and that’s a lie. Lendio is forcing us into bankruptcy. This company is ridiculous. Lendio is extremely unorganized, confusing and misleading. They are also using a lender, Ready Capital, where they are both seemingly manipulating not only me but other business owners. Not a single person in this company has knowledge of solutions or problem solving. I’ve spoken to at least 11 different people and there is still no beneficial results. I’ve been 100% patient and overly understanding. However, Lendio will be the cause of my staff suffering lost of funds and non payment. This is not a game. Lendio is treating I and others like PPP is a joke and non-urgent. Lendio’s staff never has an answer for me. I’ve completed everything needed. My status has been saying funded for over 2 weeks. I have not been funded and Lendio called me today to ask REFINANCE questions on my very first PPP loan. There’s no way I should be having a refinance conversation on a first draw that hasn’t even been credited to my bank account. Lendio is a lost, problematic company. I hate I trusted them with my business. It’s disappointing and damaging to both parties.",1
It was the most horrendous experience,They have almost ZERO communication during the loan process. Emailed them many times and rarely received any kind of response.They replied about responding. I sent probably 15-20 emails--most of which were never answered. They (occasionally) respond to an email. You can't call anyone either.I signed paperwork (online) for the loan and it took quite a while before it was ever funded. I was emailing about when to expect funding and got one reply saying it was already funded when it wasn't in my account. It mysteriously showed up about a week later.They have almost ZERO communications regardless of what their reply says.,1
I applied for a loan through lending…,"I am a restaurant owner that originally submitted my application for the PPP loan in October but I had to wait for the next round. In February I posted a negative review but removed it because a rep contacted me and stated that they would improve their service and asked if I would remove my review. However, it is still difficult to get in touch with people. I’ve had to resubmit my info because some how it went missing. I’ve had different account managers and everyone seems clueless. And my application has been in “sending to lender” status for weeks now. I also held on thinking my application would get pushed through with the 2 weeks that was dedicated to small businesses under 20 employees but nothing happened. Now that I know the ppp program is being extended I went ahead and withdrew my application and will apply with a different company. Lendio is a horrible company. It’s sad because many businesses are trying to receive this loan just stay afloat.",1
Process took way longer than…Terrible,"Repetitive requests for the SAME documents.  Phone calls asking me to call them back, no return number left in the message and pressing ""redial"" yielded message, ""...the number you have dialed..."".   Updates to the online file were acknowledged as ""received"" then a week later had reverted to the previously saved version.  The rotation and quantity of handlers on the file was like a revolving door -- handle something ONCE, handle it CORRECTLY and handle it completely -- it would save time and frustration for everyone.  If you want uploaded files labeled/titled a certain way, tell us in ADVANCE of us uploading it not after we have uploaded documents then have to go back and relabel.  Create a field for ""Business Address"" and ""Mailing Address"" -- there is a difference for many companies.   Shall I continue?",1
Poor communication,Terrible I have not received funds even though it says I have and it’s been more than 10 business daysFunds were released into wrong account not mine and I am having to wait for them to be reissued.... once two more days pass then what? Does that mean ready capital is a scam????,2
Poor timeliness,"I am very disappointed with Lendio. They would not correct the errors on my PPP loan application. They knew about the corrections needed and didn’t do anything. I worked on this for months. I ended up contacting the lender and the corrections was done! Lendio kept telling me that I was approved for $2700.00. Finally after contacting the lender, I was approved for $20833.00. A BIG DIFFERENCE! I will never use Lendio again. They have the worst customer service! I have emails to prove this!",1
Could never get in touch with nobody,"Lendio is probably the worst company to work with for the PPP loans. No one in the company knows what is going on and it has been over two months and my 2 remaining PPP loans remain in limbo. Not one person who is hired as a temp has any idea of what the hell is going on. You are playing with companies survival. As of today, I had to pull my remaining PPP loan applications because of the lack of faith I have with Lendio. I would NEVER recommend this company even to my worst enemy. There is no care or empathy for what is happening in the world, you are ONLY looking at dollar signs and fake out the customer that you are a valid company.",2
I did apply for ppp..filled out for and…,"I have been EXTREMELY disappointed with the level of communication, efficiency, & process.I have been waiting for my most recent loan now for almost 3 months; 3 MONTHS! 🤷🏻‍♂️This is even after the owner got involved, as I was told. I was looking for a new lender for ongoing business loans, Lendio will not be anywhere NEAR the top of that list.4:29 pm CSTRegarding Lendio reply.I never received an approval on 3/10, rather a notification, on 3/8, that application was being reassigned...AGAIN.No approval from Lendio as of this time.",1
We completed our PPP application on…,"Summary: Lendio is easily the worst organized company I have ever dealt with.I documented the process. It includes 70+ comms with 15 people. It took them 55 days to fund my loan. They applied twice and misplaced the first approval. That approval blocked me from using another lender (obstruction) including their own second attempt. It took 54 communications to learn of my first approval, 4 weeks after it was granted. Another 20 comms to get the money.I tried to upload the entire text of my docs but trustpilot limits the length.

This is almost criminal.,I spent all night scanning in the documents requested and there were a ton! Was contacted the next day with a request for more documents. I completed that task and then there was no communication. I emailed I called I complained but no one was listening or responded. Finally after three weeks I got a new rep assigned to me but we still didn’t get answers. I finally called my bank that referred me to them and he said “yes you are funded and put the money in my account the next day. Why is it so hard for Lendio to answer people???,1
The most stressful experience,"Lendio app is a disaster. I did my first app with Kabbage, which was awesome, but since they were bought out I had to find some place else. If the Lendio app had a better design and flow there would be no need for customer service, which Lendio is not the best with. I had to reach out several times :/",1
Like I said before horrible service I…,"Lendio's post lending experience is a huge concern. I did my initial PPP loan through this site. For the 2nd go around, I did not qualify for PPP, however they kept sending me emails saying ""You need to submit your documents for your loan,"" The problem is, this made it sound like they wanted forgiveness documents for my existing loan, however it was really for a new loan as I questioned it and clarified this with my rep from the first loan. Essentially they wanted me to apply for a new loan without having me realize it. My proof on this is they would send me first time emails with ""Re:"" in the subject line, I believe this is a violation of the CAN-SPAM act. I constantly reported this to my rep for the 1st loan and nothing was done about it. Their practices concern me and appear to be intentionally deceptive. I have enough proof of this, the questionable emails were constant until I put my foot down on them and demand they stop.",1
The whole experience has been bad,"Phone numbers don't work, noone calls back noone responds to email.And we still haven't gotten then money for the SBA loan.",1
Im constantly asked to sign the same…,"Update April 1 2021: after 35 days in caweb and no funds I successfully cancelled with lendio and was funded with a different company. Up until then I got the same, generic messages that it would be handled. Thankful to PayPal for getting through and funding us, I’m assuming they were able because the loan was a month old and not funded.Lendio is now having my review flagged as false. I submitted all documentation showing that my claims are in fact valid and I did have a loan with lendio but they never followed through. As of today 4/1 the loan was cancelled in caweb. Yesterday it was still showingActive not funded. I was contacted a week ago stating they tried submitting to SBA for a 5th time but PayPal got through and got us a number. I was disappointed that 30 days in caweb, I was finally getting a call for resolution but fortunately it was too late as another lender actually delivered. Update!!: after 35 days in caweb and no funds I successfully cancelled with lendio and was funded with a different company. Up until then I got the same, generic messages that it would be handled.

Can’t reach customer service or call without being told nobody available.Our loan expires in 3 day’s!!",2
I’m not funded at all I’m about too,"I'm convinced the good reviews for lendio on Trustpilot are fake and by robots. I applied over two weeks ago and was never assigned a loan number or lender as I learned today after speaking with a rep.  After the application submission, I noticed that I was never sent a confirmation email with details of an assigned funding manager. It wasn't until I called in, did I receive her name. I also could never log in to the portal. When I called about this issue, they said I had misspelled my email. Yea right! I would never misspell my email! Total lies. I noticed another reviewer also said that they told them the same thing. I provided a different email and still could not log in to the portal.  I thought Lendio would be quicker than my bank and is the primary reason I went here. They were not! I got nothing but a waste of time from Lendio.Update: I've learned that Lendio flagged my review. It's unbelievable that they would go to such lengths to keep their shady practices hidden. It appears this is standard practice for them to do so with the negative reviews that they receive. Once they flag it and the customer does not provide proof, Trustpilot sets the review to invisible. This is how they are able to maintain a rating over 4 stars.I forgot to mention that about four days after application submission, I experienced theft from my personal bank account.",2
Lendio is problematic,"I would not recommend Lendio to anyone. Although we finally getting our loan but we had to go through tremendous rig•ma•role. I was recommended by our payroll company that we have been doing business with for some times. Lendio’s loan operation is purely on internet. They came back with multiple tiny issues with the applications that I had to run through and find. Loan agents, their phone numbers and email addresses are useless as they never reply.",1
They have almost ZERO communication…,"I’m very disturbed with how I been handled, I was to receive 45,000 dollars, but I got my funding it was only for 23,000 dollars. I called right away and spoke with a representative and explained my situation and then I asked them what should since i did not get the 45,000 dollars. She told me and this conversation is being recorded to go a head and sign and she was going to have a Mr Acosta contact me to help me out, well no one called. I called again and spoke with another rep and she told me a man named Landon would call me back he didn’t, it really appears nobody cares. I have made less money then I did before when I applied. I am in need of the 45,000 because my work is slow. PLEASE can someone help me. 404 520 6222",1
Horrible company,My status say i was funded a week ago but haven’t gotten my funds yet,1
Unnecessarily disorganized,Very bed .I never been back used to apply .,2
Terrible I have not received funds even…,"Ultimately, I applied through Lendio, and got my PPP funded. And I know businesses were under a lot of stress to process PPP applications. But I was assigned 6 different ""funding managers"" over 3 weeks, and had trouble getting information out of any of them. Only got movement when I emailed the COO about the bad communications. Even after funding, the bad communications continued - with 6 emails in 2 days after my PPP had been deposited — telling me i was declined, then not declined, then so close, then incomplete, then complete.",1
I am very disappointed with Lendio,"Do not use this company. Terrible customer service. Inaccurate FAQs and zero help. I applied for funds on Jan 11,2021. I received funds on Mar 8. Despite having received my Sba Feb 17 and zero contact until I make a complaint via BBBYou mean I called and received zero information. As reported in my BBB complaint.",1
Lendio is probably the worst company!!!,The worst at replying back to emails and phone calls. Spoke with at least six representatives and all assured me paperwork was fine but one after another said I was missing something. It took almost two months to receive PPP funding when others received immediately. Now I’m in jeopardy of not getting second draw and losing much needed funds.,1
TERRIBLE!,Not a great experience. Application process awkward and time consuming,2
Lendio: worst organization ever. Full documentation,Horrible CommunicationPotential of 19K I received 1700.00,1
Good luck,"Horrible horrible will never use them again, we were approved by SBA they kept blaming the lender we sat for 4 weeks waiting for our funds we ended up going direct to lender to get our funds worst experience ever do not use them!",1
Lendio app is a disaster,Paperwork was easy but the customer service was poor. None of my questions were answered.,2
My post lending experience a concern,"We applied on the first day of the PPP program and Lendio has tied up our loan with an assigned SBA number in other words it is locked to them.  It has been in this state, as ""approved by one of their lenders"" for over a month and they just send me template boilerplate emails that tell be almost nothing.  They call me from time to time but the person I talk to addmitedly does not know and cannot help.  By any measure, we are a clear cut easy to qualify business.  If I go to another bank I will have lost 2 months.  My regular bank has said that Lendio will need to release it from the SBA before they can processing a new application.  I do not want to start over and the program is about to expire.  Reply:  Lendio has done nothing to assist.  I had to go elsewhere and begin the process over.",1
Customer service is terrible,"Difficult to maneuver website due to slow responses. Very poor communication from agents,",1
What a nightmare!!,Thankyou for everything really grateful,1
Fake reviews and a case of Identity theft after submitting Lendio Application,"Here I am, back nearly 2 weeks later! How is this company even in business? All they do is lie and lead you on. They will request additional documents over and over and over again, making you think that they're working on your loan. If you ever actually get to speak with someone they'll tell you ""everything looks good, just waiting on the lender."" A few days later you will get an email asking for additional documents. This is the game they play. I finally decided enough is enough and asked them to withdraw my application and release the SBA loan number a few days ago. Mason my funding manager assured me that he would take care of it and that my loan number would be released. Fast forward to today; I receive an email from Lendio ""REQUESTING ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS!"" ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Lendio, quit playing games with people's lives! Quit lying and actually do what you say you're going to do! You also lied to Trust Pilot saying my previous review was ""not genuine"" trying to get them to remove it. As you can see, the review is still there and also VERIFIED! I want my application withdrawn and the SBA loan number attached to my name released immediately!",1
Hell Hole,Too long for funding after signing loan docs.,2
I’m very disturbed with how I been…handled no one wants to help.,"unresponsive, funding still has not occurred, cannot recommend. American Express should be embarrassed for referring me to this company!",1
My status say i was funded a week ago…,"My experience with lendio has not been satisfying, the lack of professionalism and the constant wrong information and ignored emails and calls is countless. I was told that everything was completed on serval occasions and to my knowledge after waiting  weeks I found out that was not hardly true. I’ve had 5 funding managers and each of was very hard to get in contact with, I’m currently still trying to reach one now. I’ve been emailing and calling, leaving voicemails as well.",1
Very bed .,"Not sure why Lendio is asking for a 5star review when the whole ppp process was made a nightmare by them. To the point that I had to speak to the actual lending bank(Legacy Bank-Oklahoma) to get my application out of stall and me funded. No one at Lendio answers the phone and when they do answer, they are quick to blame the bank for the holdup. Which is total BS!This next round of PPP, I think I will deal with Legacy bank directly instead of going through Lendio as I’m sure the next time will be the same circle jerk.",1
"Successful transaction, bad customer service.",There is zero follow. I must have had 5 different contacts thru the process not one would reply to emails or voicemail. It got done not sure how. I still don't even have closing documents. Terrible service.,1
Do not use this company,"I submitted my PPP application with all supporting documents and was given a funding manager (which means nothing) who said they had what they needed. After that I was unsuccessful is getting a response from anyone at all, including the various funding managers that were assigned to me. They changed the loan amount with no explanation and when I checked on the status after 2 weeks they asked me to confirm that it was the first draw - information that was obvious.  Another week later and no one is responding, the chat is useless and I am stressed out. I withdrew my application hoping that no lender has been assigned to me and will go to a lender on my own. Don't believe the glowing reviews, they are malarkey.",1
The worst at replying back to emails…,"Long story short: STAY AWAYI first submitted my PPP August of 2020. Because of Lendio's incompetence, my application wasn't submitted on time. Now I'm on my SIXTH ""funding manager"" (sidenote: nobody at this company knows what they're/what each other is doing). The last ""manager"" was Eva Young - probably not her real name, but she REASSURED me she would keep me up to date, apologizing profusely about my experience. Well, of course after numerous texts, phone calls, and voicemails, and no response, I was again transferred to a new funding manager named Brett Banner, who AGAIN, is reassuring me he will personally handle my file. I've already had some frustrating interactions with him, so I have ZERO expectations that my PPP application will actually be picked up by a lender. Happy to reconsider if Lendio actually follows through on what it purports to provide.(BTW Eva Young, if you're reading this, you're terrible at your job).",1
Not a great experience,"I filled out my application for the second round of PPP a month ago. The account manager initially got in touch with me. Since then my account manager has changed three times and no one will call me back. I trusted them with a very important roll and getting me the second round of PPP money however now I have no idea what the status is of my application and have been left in the dark for a month. Although Lendio replied below about contacting my ""funding manager"", I have already done this, calling and emailing Evan F. ,over a dozen time with not one response. I would suggest applying elsewhere.",2
Horrible Communication,They were able to secure a PPP loan quickly but never returned any of my phone calls or emails. Called the number and always got a voicemail as if this company doesn't exist.,1
Horrible horrible will never use them…,"Despite being among the first to apply it took until March 3, 2021 to get my 1st loan. Throughout the process I was given miss leading information.  Now I am afraid I am going to miss out on a second draw. My advice pick somewhere else. If you are already with Lendio do not call them after you are placed with a lender. Call the lender direct. Very frustrating process all around and probably cost me big time.",1
Paperwork was easy but the customer…,"Been trying to get somebody on the phone to figure out the status of my application.  I had initially canceled it almost a month ago, but it went through anyway. Now I have no access to the online portal, not does anyone answer the phone.  And since my application was approved with the SBA I can't start over again with my bank.Update(3/17/2021): I have finally talked to two people (a week ago) Matt and Dominic.  My application was in manual review, which should have only lasted a ""couple"" days.  It has been over a week now.  I have called repeatedly, as well as found the number for my ""local rep"".  No surprise, but calling that phone number (and the other three for Texas) gets me nowhere. no answer, no way to leave a message (I doubt it would be returned anyway).According to the SBA website, my loan has been funded, but waiting for the money to be disbursed.How do you expect to run a business if nobody answers the phone, returns emails, or replies to text messages.  Oh, and I can't login to my account online, supposedly its a known issue that was reported a week ago to their IT team.",2
PPP Loan going nowhere,"Applied for a 2nd round PPP loan on the 1st day of applications for minority business owners in January.  It's now March and other than requesting the same information over again a couple of times, I have gotten zero follow up or feedback.  My loan officer has changed at least 3 times and not one of them has returned an email.  Even when responding directly to an email they have sent me with a question, I haven't gotten a bit of follow up.  Very frustrating when our small business has been so impacted by Covid, knowing the money is there for minority business owners but we may miss out because of the amount of time it is taking these folks to process our application.",1
Difficult to maneuver website due to…,"They’re completely disorganized. The persons who handle your cases change every single day almost. No one seems to be able to reply to any of my questions. No matter if I contact them by replying to the emails I send them or through their website, no one ever gets in touch with me to try to solve my problem. And yet they have the courage to send me an email (5 minutes ago) asking for a 5 star review. :-D what a joke. To get a 5 star review you must first provide a decent service.",2
Thankyou,The process started off fast and good. I applied through Titanbank but I guess their lender is lendio. Lendio doesn’t respond. I’ve emailed and called over and over. To have no progress on my application. I hate bashing a company but I had high hopes in this loan process from what I have read in reviews. I don’t recommend them for any business in need of immediate funds.,2
Nothing but lies!,"We used (censored) bank for the first PPP and they were great to work with. Got the money out fast too. Lendio has very poor communication. It took a long time to finally reach someone. Phone, email and chat are all hit and miss. I applied for PPP in January and still am waiting on the financial aid. It would be nice to know if ones loan is still active or if they need more information.EDIT 3-10-21I signed the loan documents yesterday.  I seems like my review got the ball rolling.  When I receive the funds I will update the reviewEDIT 3-23-21Received the funding.  Lendio has reached out to me a few times since. Please work on your customer communication guys.  Albeit not in a timely fashion, they got the job done.  3 Stars",1
Too long for funding after signing loan…,"I am grateful in the end our PPP was approved. However, I would not go through Lendio again based on my experience. I had five or more Account Managers over the application process. None of them were responsive and returned calls/messages. At one point I received a call after signing the contract the loan amount had been reduced. I questioned this as it didn't seem right. Still, I have never heard back from my Account Manager. I ended up digging up the actual lender's number and calling them to get the matter resolved and funds in my account. The lender had nothing down about my loan being reduced from the contracted amount and was unsure why Lendio stated that as the hold-up. In the end, I did get funding, with a lot of frustration and extra diligence on my end.",2
unresponsive,"I cannot explain in enough detail just how ridiculous Lendio has been. We have been trying to process a PPP loan for months now, to no avail. When Lendio's associates reach out, it must be a farce because they don't actually respond to you when you try to communicate back with them.We successfully received a round one PPP loan through a different vendor, BlueVine, previously, but made the mistake of trying Lendio for round two. Boy, I wish we hadn't. The last email called for us to ""upload all the documents we need asap"" - without explaining what documents they could possibly be referring to. Which is a joke in itself, because we uploaded all necessary documents and more in January. Worse yet, because Lendio apparently got us an SBA loan # and funds ""assigned"" to us, we can't apply for a PPP loan through anyone else while Lendio drags their heels in perpetuity.When you try to call, the phone either is busy, won't connect, or you go to a voicemail that doesn't call you back. Ever. We've had 4 or 5 different ""Funding Managers"" with Lendio, all with the same result. Consumers beware, we have been trying to work with Lendio for two months and still do not have any PPP funds.Edit 3.17.2021: The madness continues.After my review Lendio reached out, as you can see below. I received an apology for the lack of communication and was assured that no further documents were needed, that somehow the email sent asking for unspecified documents was auto-generated. Given the typos, I find that hard to believe but it gets much, much worse.I then asked the Funding Manager for an ETA or timeline. Back to silence.So I took to the virtual chat about a week later. It was revealed to me that there was an offer and money was waiting, Lendio just needed to push it through. Days passed without anything.I then received another email asking for documents that we, an limited liability partnership (LLP), just don't have. It was actually two emails: one asking for our non-existent business license and the other asking for tax forms like Form 944 that we don't have since we don't have any W-2 employees (just the two partners who obviously just use Schedule K-1 and pass through).What's more concerning than the actual document requests is what appears to be happening - we're caught in a perpetual time loop. Lendio already asked for these same documents six weeks ago. At that time, I explained the above and why they didn't exist for our type of business.Worse yet, money is apparently reserved with a lender waiting. Yet here we are, back at square 1.5, repeating myself to Lendio about non-existent documents. Honestly, this whole thing has just been miserable and this conduct is just reckless and unacceptable.Edit 3.23.2021Watched a YouTube presentation with Lendio's CEO, Brock Blake, on ""How to Keep Your [PPP] Application Moving Forward"" and could not help but notice he confirmed what I have been telling Lendio's representatives all along - that the Secretary of State Registration is sufficient proof to validate a business (i.e. fraud is running rampant so often lenders are asking for additional documentation to stop the fraudsters). We have provided that very document to Lendio at least three (3) seperate times. Rather than push our applicaiton through they keep asking for documentation that we do not have, or they ignore us instead. Something is amiss over at Lendio.Edit 4.5.2021 - Lendio attempted to take down this review, shameful. I provided documentation to Trustpilot and it has now been verified. For anyone wondering, at the end of March and since funding still did not occur, apparently the lender cancelled our application with Lendio. All that work, all that duplicate effort, all that time, for nothing.Lendio offered to resubmit the application to a different lender, but fool me once...To date, we have not received confirmation Lendio has released our number for the SBA. That means even if we apply someplace else, if that has not occurred, the SBA will still think we have an application through Lendio and it will get denied as a duplicate. Let our experience be a warning - do yourself a favor and use anyone besides Lendio for a PPP application if you're a small business like us.",1
Not a good experience with lendio,"Everything went will until I received the docusign email. It closed before I could sign completely.  I call for 3 weeks to get it corrected.  Every other day, I was assigned to another funding manager who told me there was nothing they could do.  I finally called the customer service number, who escalated it and finally I received a new email.  This was very frustrating.",1
Not sure why Lendio is asking for a 5-Star review,"The only reason I gave two stars is because I finally got my $.  I had at least 4 people reach out after applying saying ""they will contact me shortly"", and never got anything.  I got daily emails from Lendio saying ""time was running out"" and feared all $ would be gone by the time one of you dinks actually replied.  I finally applied elsewhere, only to get rejected because you incompetent clowns already forwarded my app to SBA without saying a GD thing!!  I left a vm and sent an email to you threatening litigation, and low and behold, I had my money 2 days later.  And STILL have not heard a damn thing from one your people.  For future needs I will definitely NOT be using Lendio!  Blue Vine customer service is LIGHTYEARS ahead of you!!!!",1
There is zero follow up.,3/10. This is a updated post. I finally received my funds. 16 days after signing the promissory note. Communication was very lack. Funding managers shifted several times. This process was very long and exhausting because of the lack of communication. I just don’t understand how Lendio doesn’t have a direct contact to all the Lenders. I’m updating to two stars because I finally received funds. Shouts to Landon I talked with u two days ago and now I finally have my funds. I initially begin this process January around the 15th. I signed my promissory note on 2/22. Here we are going into the 2nd week of March and I have yet to receieve my funds. I’ve had countless funding managers(who never answer the phone or respond to emails) this whole process sucks and I would not recommend using lendio. If I could give a negative star I would. They don’t even deserve 1 star!!! And I feel like all these positive post are fake and made by lendio,1
Skip the stress - go directly to the lender,"I tried to reach you after 10 days since I submitted all documents, it took me over one hour to get live person, who said they don’t have my email address , and at the same time I was bombarded with email from Lendio about everything but my case , finally when I talked to live person with in 48 hours I got my notifications that I am approvedAnyway , thank you , nevertheless I got my PPP loan",1
PPP application in limbo FOR MONTHS,"Inept and unresponsive support staff.Nobody returns calls, ever.Emails are generally ignored unless thread is initiated by lendio.On web interface it shows a friendly face of the person who is supposed to be ""online"" - completely untrue.People who respond in chat window online have absolutely ZERO subject matter expertise and are essentially useless",1
No response for a month after completing application for PPP,"Huge disappointment.Terrible communication and customer service.  No one ever returned phone calls or emails.  The chat on line was completely useless.  The web page with updates was inaccurate and showed a different fund manager every 1-3 days. A completely different experience than what we had with the first PPP with Amex.  I would not use this company again if I have a choice.  We were told by Amex to use Lendio.  I did let my Amex rep know of the poor quality of service we received, after which our loan went thru the very next day.",2
Never able to reach anyone,Not great communication.  Blamed it on my email.  Then sent my loan somewhere else they wanted all new things.  Would not recommend,2
Despite being among the first to apply....,"I spoke with my funding manager for the first time and she still didn’t know why my loan has not been funded. I was supposed to receive a phone call from a team lead: Khadija Mohammed, and still have not. I’ve emailed my funding manager to advise her of me not receiving a phone call and to ask more questions. NO REPLY FROM ANYONE! The only time I hear from the lender is when I post my reviews. I absolutely despise having to pull answers in this manner and it’s double work for me in addition to the stress of missing income in a pandemic. THIS IS HORRIBLE! I have all my documentation submitted & no one can give me answers outside of: “Please be patient... I’mNot sure what’s going on... it’s with another department.” How can I be patient when no one knows or can tell me exactly what I’m being patient for? This is borderline CRUEL!*****It’s been 3 business days since I heard from them and I was promised to receive an email update with a contact number 4 business days ago! The contact number listed for my funding manager is not a working number. I have no way to contact ANYONE!As of now, I’ve received a phone call & awaiting for a follow up email. *************I’ve been switched to 2 different account managers in less than 5 days. The number on file for my account manager is not a working number. I’ve tried chat messaging and there is never anyone who returns after saying hello. The communication and follow up is horrible. I have no idea what’s going on with my file",2
Dissatisfied with lendio.,"AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE. I applied for a second draw PPP loan through Lendio. I received a loan number, but after that, NOTHING. I have called and left messages 3 times and emailed 4 times, but no replies. It is INCREDIBLY frustrating.UPDATE, March 25th 2021:I STILL cannot get through to anyone at Lendio. No returned calls, and my emails go unanswered. 3 days ago, I received an email stating ""Your PPP loan specialist has reached out and has not heard back."" This is not true, nobody has reached out to me. I replied to the email, and was directed to call an 800 number, which turned out to be a pre-recorded telemarketer selling me on everything from lowering my Medicare costs to a new cellphone plan. I don't know what Lendio is up to but clearly they do not care about me at all as customer. I will be reporting Lendio to the Inspector General of the SBA. If Lendio cared as much about responding to my communications as they cared about responding to my negative review, this would not be an issue.",1
Applied for a 2nd round PPP loan on the…,"Loan approved and signed docs on 2-2-21. Funds never deposited and only meaningless words from Lendio. Left a 1 Star review 3 days ago, within an hour got a call. The rep basically said what they all said, wait a few more days. 3 days later not so much as an email.  Started a chat session today, guess what. Yep, ended with wait a few more days. Its been 32 days by my count. Just WOW.",1
They’re completely disorganized,"Initially everything went smooth. Although I did send a copy of a voided check to get the lender the correct business bank account, when I received the loan documents via esig the account number had the last 2 digits left off. The lender caught it and asked for clarification. I responded and resent the voided check. No confirmation it was ever corrected and its been weeks and very difficult and time consuming to get ahold of anyone. My guess is they do great unless there is a problem then you are lost in a maze of online and automated processes. I did get a person via chat yesterday that seemed to help and was going to follow up. Nothing after 24 hours. Hopefully I am not lost in another maze.3/19/2021 update. Contract was resent and resigned Monday March 15th  and we are waiting for funding. In fairness they did originally say it could take up to 10 days fo fund the loan.  (Loan was originally approved 2/23/2021)4/12/2021 New documents were sent (my 3rd set) and signed 3/29/2021 still no funding. I did reach out to the actual lender and they won't help either. They say the problem is on Lendio's side. What a mess - Don't risk it go somewhere else.",1
The process started off fast and good,I am having trouble with lendio. I reached out several times via email and phone but hardly no answer/reply. I got a representative on the phone and she made it seem as if my application was fully completed but was just sitting there for days. I am not sure why I have even been issued a loan number yet.,2
I need help to keep my business running.,"MY FUNDS WERE NOT SENT ON MONDAY MARCH 8th!!!! LENDIO IS STILL LYING!!!!Was funded 1/2 my PPP loan. Have been working with Lendio for over 2 weeks, getting the run around from every single employee. Nothing like signing a promissory note and getting 1/2 of the amount. Lendio reps told me 'tough luck, call the bank, we did our part'. Can you believe that? if it isn't resolved within a few more days I am definitely taking my case to an attorney",2
"Communication is poor, wished I'd used my bank","I started this process with the 2nd PPP and it is has been hell with this company.  You can not speak to anyone and they do not respond to emails.  I appears they did good doing the first PPP but this 2nd round they are lost.  I would not recommend this company for any kind of loan.  I started this back on 02/19/2021 I have been in the lending status for 2 and half weeks and every week they change funding managers on you I have had 3 doing this time.  I have requested to withdraw my application and can not get a response.  On there site there is a link that allow you to withdraw your application but it goes no where it ask you to call 855-853-6346 and when you call it tells you that they are too busy to answer the call to try and email someone.  So I requested by email and still no answer from anyone.  DO NOT WASTE YOU TIME with LENDIO. BAD, BAD, BAD choice.Update: WOW, Today for the first time I got someone to respond stating that they tried calling me.  My phone is right here and I have not received a call from Lendio.  It told me to write a bad review to get someone from this company to reach out to me.  What a jokeUpdate: 03/08/2021 Today I checked to see if I received an email from Lendio and there was non.  However, when I checked my PPP on Lendio website they have locked me out and cancelled my PPP application without notice that was being done.  PLEASE everyone do not use Lendio they made this process very hard and that is not what we are looking for when hard times hit you.  We what a company that understand and will do everything they can to help.  All they have done is create headaches and stress to the process and very poor communication if you can get an answer out of anyone at all.Update 03/24/21 - Today I was able to access my account on Lendio after being blocked for a week and now this is how that have me account.:I applied for this loan back on 02/19/2021 today on 03/24/21 I went to Lendio portal and this is what they had Paycheck Protection Program OffersYOUR APPLICATIONSSecond DrawLOAN OFFERSAdd DocumentsEdit ApplicationDownload ApplicationSuccess!

Two months later and still no PPP...,Worse company ever. I’ve been going back and forth with these people for a month. I finally signed my loan documents Feb 22nd. Today is March 5th and I still have not received my funds. My advice would be to skip the middle man and deal directly with the lenders. They give you the run around snd they’ve switched my account managers 6 times since I started this process.,1
Rate Lendio,I would like to say that the people at lendio were less then helpful through this process lendio will not let me be fully honest and post who caused less then assistance during my process they are a disgrace in the process. I would say if I had to do this again with the multiple incompatence on lendios part I would pick another lender I will say if it wasnt for Jarrett and another young lady to correct there issues I might of gone else where. Lendio you need to retrain your management very very poor results.,2
The only reason I gave two stars is…,NOONE tried to contact me !!!!!!  I’ve been sitting with my phone in my hand waiting for you people to call. ALL LIES !!!! I signed my loan documents on February 23 today is March 4 and my funds still have not been deposited into my account. I have an SBA number and I still have no funds in my account. This money is a life line for my business and I can’t get any answers.  I’ve been calling all day no one returns my phone calls. I’ve emailed my representative and she’s never got back to me today. I don’t understand why my funds have not been to posted if the SBA has allocated those funds to my business. Ironically its day 10 they don’t pick up the phone for me.. I don’t want to give them a bad review. I just want to be treated like I matter. At this point I don’t feel like that. I understand that you guys are very busy but don’t treat me like I don’t matter and that’s all I’m asking.And if you called me like you say you did why wouldn’t you call back or leave a message? I’m a small minority business owner why do I have to get treated this way? Just want fairness. I hope I’m not asking too much,2
THIS IS RIDICULOUS,"This is the worst company. No one is ever picking up the calls or responding to voice or emails. I applied for PPP loan thru them. Not only they rejected my application and didn’t let me know but their shady lender Customer Bank has secured SBA number for this loan. As a result I cannot apply through another lender even though my business definitely qualifies for a loan. Do not deal with them!UpdateOnly After writing my initial review someone immediately tried to reach out as stated in their response.They promised to connect next day, still waiting. Worst customer service!",2
I tried to reach you after 10 days…,"Have had 10 different funding managers for 2nd Draw PPP loan. Sole Proprietor, 2nd draw. First draw was Fundbox (excellent experience but they aren't doing 2nd draw)Applied 1/26Loan submitted to SBA 2/7Signed Loan Docs for Benworth Cap 2/18Still nothing, lender says app is stuck in Lendio's portal and they can't do anything about it.Can not get ahold of anyone @ Lendio, cannot apply anywhere else because they're holding my loan hostage as Active, undisbursed with the SBA. Calls go nowhere - emails ignored - website chats unanswered.Update: Total waste of over a month. Lender Benworth Capital does not go by SBA guidelines, should not be allowed to originate PPP loans. Terrible experience through and through, having the middleman Lendio did more harm than good during an already slow process, and stole over a month of my time by failing to respond and reassigning Lending Managers.",2
Inept and unresponsive support,Horrible experience. First draw PPP. Taysha hicks is my funding manager. No contact what so ever. My loan is locked in and there is nothing I can do about it being that if I withdraw it the etran number would be in que past the expiration date of the ppp program. I recommend nobody use this service for their needs. Not even loans.,2
Huge disappointment,Review Pending!,1
Not great communication,"Update 3/20. Still no funding. They had us change loan amount 4 times. We’ve had a loan in caweb active undispursed for 23 days. After they reached out after this review, no word since aside from change loan amount. Was even told they saw the contract with loan amount and docusign then suddenly needed it changed again. I’m giving it til mid next week. If no progress I’m withdrawing my application. I’ve been a lendio hostage for nearly a month. Other ppp lenders came back with a rejection due to active loan from Lendio weeks ago. I would have been funded by now. I made a mistake & my business is suffering because of it.Lender beware. 3/8- Still haven’t received loan docs, it’s been nearly 96 hours since I was told 24-48 hours to receive them.Calls & emails, no response. General customer service number wont take calls due to high call volume. Live support not available. Emailed, sent a text & called funding manager. My caweb shows loan originated 2/25, so today is 10 days & still no loan docs.I’m starting to question my decision to stay with Lendio at this point. Only change was portal updated with “SBA Loan sent to lender”. Nothing since. Updating my review once again as I was hopeful after speaking to funding manager & team leader on Thursday that things would get moving but I’m once again stuck. 3/7/21 6:00 pm update:I still haven’t received my closing docs. I was told they would arrive in 24-48 hours. I’ve checked all folders, nothing. Sent an email to funding manager. Update: I just received a call from a gentleman at Lendio. He apologized for the lack of communication and stated that he was handling it and our docusign should arrive very shortly but they are on it. I understand that Lendio is swamped and it’s tough sending out updates. I will update with the progress of our loan as they come in. I’m very hopeful after speaking to him that our issue will be resolved. Everyone I have been able to speak with at Lendio has been pleasant & it seems they really do want to help. Will continue to update & revise my review. Update 2: My funding manager reached out. Updated my correct loan amount & is handling it.Should receive docs in 24-48 hours. She said 7-10 days for funding.She also gave me her direct contact info if we have any questions or problems. (I will not share this info. So please refrain from asking). Very pleased at their quick response & dedication. Will post further updates. I am really at a loss. I was given an SBA number a week ago. Zero emails. Zero response to emails. My funding manager has changed multiple times in just the past week alone, which honestly is irrelevant because the emails I’ve written have went unread. The only communication I’ve received is from live chat. I get the generic “waiting on loan documents”’response from them & have for the past week.My loan shows active un-dispersed in Caweb with an origination date of 2/25. The communication is terrible. Live chat states I can’t be told who my lender is & any communication will be done through Lendio. Yet Lendio doesn’t even send a generic email or respond! My funding managers voice mail is full. I’m really considering pulling my application & starting over because I worry if any issues arise, I won’t make the 3/31 deadline.This funding is dire for small business! This is a first round ppp. I feel I was given an almost instant SBA loan number to “lock me in”. Now I can’t get a loan with another company unless I go through the hassle of getting my current SBA number cancelled. To ensure I wasn’t missing these emails, I confirmed they had the correct email. Checked all spam folders. Nothing.SBA states I should be funded within the next 3 days but that’s impossible beings I haven’t even gotten closing documents for my loan. I’m seeing people either waiting 6 weeks at this same stage. I’m big into the Reddit ppp/EIDL- small business forums on Reddit, Facebook & Instagram. Unfortunately this seems to be a common thing with Lendio. My business is struggling, I’m tired of checking my email every 10 mins to find nothing. I understand Lendio is slammed but the point of this 2 weeks was for small business to get relief in a timely manner.If I could receive just the closing docs or some communication other than “just waiting on closing docs. Please be patient” that would be great. I trusted & recommended Lendio early on but I’m beginning to regret my decision.Apply & get an SBA loan number within 24 hours at your own risk because the common theme is “don’t review applicants, submit to SBA to lock them in & do the verifying &App after the fact”. Typically I show patience in these situations but we are drowning & can’t afford waiting.I pray Lendio makes this right & pushes through these applications or at the least makes it clear they aren’t adhering to SBA guidelines.",2
Communication is HORRIBLE,My husband signed his loan papers on feb 23 and still NO funds in his account. He has been calling all day and NO ONE picks up the phone. Where are his funds if the SBA has already given to the lender. Why haven’t the been released,1
AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE,"You can’t reach anyone via email or text. I have an problem they created but I can NOT get anyone to help me? I put my application in January 24, 2021 it is now March 4th. I am also unable to get loans from anywhere else do to this issue. The number they give is out of service this is outrageous, and very bad business to help out small business owner.This is follow up since Lendio's response made it sound like everything is good. I have had 4 different people try to contact me ONLY after a negative review but even after their initial contact, they are still holding my old application. I am not getting any help from this company.",1
Absolutely Pathetic,"Update:This morning Ready Capital contacted me and asked me to sign ANOTHER loan document - this is the third one! Dated today. With a threat that if I don't quickly sign that I will have to start over. See my review of Ready Capital.Note that on the Ready Capital loan document the loan amount is ""$a1j4O00000EHFWHQA5""STAY AWAYUpdate:Lendio contacted me within minutes of posting a review. So, for all of you that can't get in touch with them about your PPP loan, post a 1 star review.He told me that Lendio sent me another docusign on 2/26 which I had signed. This is the second one - Ready Capital sent one on 2/2. He assured me that the loan would be disbursed soon since we signed the second form on 2/26. It is now day 11. The is the second time that they have not disbursed the funds within 10 days. I've tried applying with other lenders but the application is rejected because we are locked into Lendio. STAY AWAY FROM LENDIO. They are completely overwhelmed. I've had 3-4 ""relationship managers"" in this process and not a single one responds to any contact. --- Ready Capital approved PPP and sent to Lendio on Feb 4th when they got the SBA Loan number which locks me in to Lendio. It is now a MONTH later and Lendio still has not disbursed funds. They were supposed to disburse funds within 10 days. I call Lendio and they say they're still working to find a lender. All the while I'm locked out of other lenders. I've had 3 different Lendio reps and no one knows what the heck is going on. Absolutely horrible experience. They are in violation of the SBA rules of disbursing within 10 days.",1
Initially everything went smooth,"I applied for the PPP Loan, I am a small business. I was sent documents to sign with the wrong amount (significantly lower than what my business income entitles me to), I reached out several times for help with fixing it and no one has gotten back to me.  NO ONE.  I called my ""contact"" and left several messages.  I texted the number she instructed me to use, and nothing.  I've emailed 3 times and nothing.  If you can try to get a PPP Loan from ANYWHERE ELSE, do that.  I'm now trapped.",1
I am having trouble with lendio,"Lendio was a bad experience. Locked me in on their process, told me I’d have to wait weeks to withdraw (so I couldn’t go to another lender) told me to change the amount of loan I requested, then approved me for a different amount (different than what I requested and what they told me to change to) without asking me if that was OK, and then none of their reps would return my calls or emails.",1
Was funded 1/2 my PPP loan,It has now been a week since I was told someone would help me.   I have called and emailed but NO response from anyone.   Very Disappointed!,1
I started this process with the 2nd PPP…,I submitted all paperwork on January 18th and received an immediate text/call and email form a representative. At that time I emailed over the remaining requested info and a call was set up for Jan 22nd to go over everything and get us squared away. I was stood up for that call and emailed with no response. I had 5 different reps assigned to our file and emailed or called each as I saw their names with no response. The chat function told me reps were dealing with 150 apps a day but after 3 weeks I don't know how there were thousands of applications in before ours when it was submitted on the first day. I kept getting emails saying everything was entered and then would get an email saying some document was missing. On Feb 20th I was walked thru the application again when I went to ensure the docs were all there and it resubmitted the application like it was new. I then finally got a good rep who followed thru and followed up by phone and had to email supporting info and tax docs in for a 3rd time. We finally got our funds last week after a 6 week process and needing to follow up dozens of times with no response. We went with Lendio as opposed to a big bank for the 2nd draw due to forgiveness being denied repeatedly at Chase though all paperwork was official. Chase has just begun accepting 2020 forgiveness this week. We wanted to avoid the run around with Chase but got a bigger one with Lendio,1
Worse company ever,There is no customer service number to call for technical difficulties with the website.  I applied with another company since no one even returns emails.,1
I would like to say that the people at…,Unable to reach anyone by phone for several days and no response to email or messages.,2
I signed my loan documents on February…,Unorganized and unprofessional. I'm trying to apply for draw 2 within the 2 weeks and it is stating my loan number is incorrect but this company did my first ppp. I still haven't received any help with this issue.  Thought it would be easier to go through the same company but I'll go through another now. Also the website is badly flawed constantly updating my application but it won't save or register my SBA loan number! Very upset consumers!! 3/17 STILL UNABLE TO APPLY FOR 2ND DRAW. I CAN NOT LOGIN AT ALL ANYMORE AND ALL MY CURRENT INFORMATION WAS UPLOADED TO THIS SITE. I WOULD GIVE NO STARS IF I COULD! AND I CALL WAS JUST TOLD TO CALL BACK MONDAY NOTHING THEY CAN DO! WAS ALSO GIVEN A WEBSITE FOR MY SBA LOAN NUMBER VERIFICATION. WOULD HELP IF I COULD LOGIN!! I'M SURE FUNDS ARE GONE THANKS FOR ADDING TO MY HARDSHIP LENDIO!! FMLI cannot login and thanks for letting me know weeks later. Horrible customer service!!,1
This is the worst company,Our funds were sent back and we have not been able to get ahold of anybody and then you didn't resolve this issue for us we have opened up a new bank account and we are urgently needing our funding and nobody over there seems to care,1
Held Hostage by Lendio,"Although I did received the PPP loan, This was a very prolonged and confusing process,  my application was assigned to literally 6 different people and no one returned my calls.  Finally Richard was the only one that was efficient and had the follow through.",1
Horrible experience,I’m giving Lendio a poor rating because there customer service is horrible and there communication is very poor it’s so hard to get ahold of a reps.,1
"DO NOT use Lendio, they are not trustworthy",I contacted them several times but never received a response. My PPP loan was funded but I could have received more if I went through PayPal but that loan was stopped because I could never get ahold of anyone through Lendio to help with my application or to withdraw it.,1
I am really at a loss update:,Service has been horrible. The PPP loan was put in place to help small business survive. We are dying out here and Lendio has our applications held hostage. I need my application withdrawn ASAP !! This is a total scam Im now having to fire two staff members Friday because of this crap .,1
My husband signed his loan papers on…,"Service has been horrible. The PPP loan was put in place to help small business survive.  We are dying out here and Lendio has our applications held hostage.

You can NOT talk to them......,"I've never seen a company that goes to such extreme's to hide from their customers.  You screwed up my loan by only partially funding the agreed upon amount and then refuse to return phone calls or e-mails despite acknowledging you screwed it up.Now they are trying to say that the amount they approved was based on the documents I sent over.  Which is correct, but they approved an amount and then funded only a portion.  They acknowledged separately that they screwed up but don't know how to fix and now they are trying to cover by pushing this back on me.  I guess that is to be expected for a company with no integrity!",1
Failing PPP disbursements - been a month since approved!,"Absolutely terrible experience. Non-communicative, non-knowledgeable, email conversation drop off spontaneously. There is no sense of care, despite the fact that people's businesses and livelihood are on the line here.",1
"wrong amount, and no one answers to help","Applied for a PPP second draw about a month ago. They processed the application, submitted it to a lender (Benworth), and there has been no movement. The funds are reserved at the SBA since the first week of Feb, so I can't apply elsewhere, and I can't get in contact with anyone at Lendio or Benworth (their phone mailbox is full and if you call it will hang up on you) to cancel the approval with the SBA. I requested to withdraw my application, but have heard nothing. Stuck and can't apply anywhere else. Avoid at all costs.",2
"Lendio was a bad, bad experience","I applied for our PPP on 2/3 with Lendio...was asked several times for the same documentation over and over again, had 2 different representatives reach out to me about my application. Finally on 2/12 we received word that we had passed the processing stage and had been issued our SBA # and would be receiving our funds soon. It is now 3/2 and our funding manager changes everyday...each time I email one to check on the status of our funding a new funding manager shows up on our account. I reached out to the SBA and they stated we should of received our funds by now - I can't get anyone to respond, and this is getting old really quick!!! If you weren't an honest company why did you take this on???? What do I need to do to get my PPP funds ASAP. Cancel my app, reapply elsewhere....HELP!!!!!!",1
Update,No follow through with emails. Can’t get a hold of anyone on the phone.,1
Disappointing Process and no response,"Lendio has managed to make the entire Covid19 Relief effort worse.  The loan was approved and all docs signed on the Feb 2nd. Today is March 2nd and funds have not been deposited.  Customer service is absolutely despicable, chat sessions are ‘cookie cutter’ and always end in some form of ‘wait a few more days’ / ‘moving through the process’. Now I’m stuck because the SBA has issued a Loan Number with them.  This is has been a nightmare. WOW.******************************************************************Less than an hour after leaving a 1 Star review of the trap I've found myself in with Lendio I received a phone call from representative who sounded very concerned. He said he would forward my info to someone a bit higher up and who may be able to get it resolved.  Well, as I stated in my original review the sessions always end with 'wait a few more days'. And here we are again, 3 days after the phone call and not  so much as an email on the status. LOL. I'm truly beginning to think all of these 5 Star reviews are from Russian Bots. WOW, at 51 years of age I've had better service at highway truck stops.",2
There is no customer service number to…,"My experience with Lendio has been a nightmare! I can’t get anyone on the phone, funding managers change every day. When I did get someone on the phone a few weeks back, I was told by Morgan that I was approved and my loan docs were being completed and Legacy Bank is my lender and I should have funding by March 3rd (A lie, I spoke with Legacy Bank myself)  and they were getting ready to be put into the portal for me to accept. At that time she took the liberty to tell me the person handling my funding is Steve Fox. I tried to reach out to Steve but never any answer. Next day I look on the portal, my funding manager has changed to Misty Carol. I tried calling a few times and finally I emailed Misty about my status as I never received loan docs. Misty responds to tell me that the bank is requesting my articles of incorporation and EIN information, which Lendio has in their portal. Misty informs me via email that she can’t find it, I send it immediately and was reassured that I’m still on track for March 3rd.My gut told me that something just wasn’t right so I actually call Legacy Bank in Oklahoma to make that my file was in order and that was a client of Lendio. The lady at the bank told me that they have had so many clients of Lendio call them to complain that they had no choice but to take over handling the loans due to the service failures of Lendio. The rep informed that they HAVE NO LOAN DOCUMENT FOR ME!! I gave her my SBA information to research and now I’m back waiting. The Legacy Bank rep did inform me that due to me not having loan docs yet, there is no way that I would be getting funded by March 3rd! STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!! Has truly been a nightmare experience and I pray that SBA excludes them being a lender in the future.UPDATE: My new funding manager by the name of Alicia finally responded via email  with some stupid task of providing more documents and blaming it on SBA and Legacy Bank. I actually spoke with the lender at Legacy Bank in Oklahoma that handles the PPP loans and he made it very clear that Lendio is giving people the run around and doing the most unnecessary things that aren’t even required and that my file should’ve been completed and closed so they can submit it through their system to be submitted and funded. All of my verifications was able to be done while on the phone with the Legacy Bank Lender. The bank told me to give him 24hrs to get Lendio to stop playing games if I don’t see my loan docs in 24hrs, to call him back directly. STAY AWAY FROM LENDIO! A nightmare come true!!",1
Unable to reach anyone by phone for…,"Applied for second PPP loan through Lendio, against my better judgment. My credit union, anxious to get me funded, was put on hold when Lendio obtained an SBA number then told me that it would be difficult to cancel/withdraw so that I can get fundding. My application was completed with Lendio back in early February and as of two weeks ago they've had everything they needed, with the loan documents signed on 2/21/21. SBA regulations say that lenders must disburse funds within 10-days from recieving the SBA number ""The lender must make a one-time, full disbursement of the PPP loan within 10 calendar days of loan approval; a loan is considered approved when the loan is assigned a loan number by the SBA"" (SBA Website). THIS HAS NOT HAPPENED. I check the portal every day, up until yesterday it said it was complete and that Customers Bank had the loan, today it says ""Sent to Lender"". STAY CLEAR OF LENDIO!UPDATE: PLP was CANCELLED for lack of lender funding within 10-days, with ZERO contact from Lendio before I wrote this!!!",1
Unorganized and unprofessional,"The software was so mickey mouse on the back end that it sends you email after email to reload docs that are already in the system and to resign your application. It's really a joke how they slapped this together, even if you are able to actually complete the application good luck on getting it forgiven with the way the system processes info.  I know at least 2-3 other business owners that just gave up after the third try.  With shooty programming like this, I would not trust my banking info to be protected, AVOID Lendio!!",1
Our funds were sent back and we have…,"I began my application on January 26th 2021 for my first draw ppp loan.  Needless to say,  the process has been anything but smooth or professional.  I recieved an email on February 5th with a link to sign my loan,  thinking I would receive my funds within at least 10 business days. Today, After nearly a month later,  I have yet to receive any funding.  I have attempted several times,  at least once a week to contact  my one of many different funding managers,  with no response.  The only time I can get anyone to respond is through the chat with customer service.  Even then,  nothing is being done.  The first customer service representative said he notified his manager and my funding manager of the issue,  and they would find out why I haven't received the funds. That was 11 business days after I signed the loan agreement. 3 days later,  I sent an email to my new funding manager,  not sure why a new one was assigned to my account.  After no response I reached out to customer service, again,  last Thursday. I was told that she had contacted my funding manager,  who said she had several meetings that day and would contact me as soon as possible.  It's been 3 business days,  with no response. I really feel like the company is understaffed, or not trained very well.  Also feel like I'm being given the runaround, since I've been given a loan number,  signed a loan agreement and have not received any funds, without any explanation for the delay,  past the 10 days the sba gives the lender to issue funds.",1
This was a very prolonged and confusing…,"I have been passed between 10 DIFFERENT Lendio representatives in the last 30 days.  No loan, no lender,and ""I'll be in touch shortly to go over your application.""Which, has never happened.  Phone calls not answered or ""cannot be accessed."" Qualified loan amount reduced by more than 1/2 in final document with no explanation.",1
I’m giving Lendio a poor rating because…,I applied with them back in February. Was given two different loan amount and three different loan managers. I was told the loan is complete back in February to look out for documents to sign and I still have not received anything. This process is so stressful due to my business really needing the funding due to the pandemic.,2
I contacted them several times but…,Complete and utter waste of time. So many positive reviews on here are obviously fake. Nice marketing campaign.,2
Service has been horrible! Glamkclosetinc withdraw my app,"poor customer service when dealing with ppl loans, can't contact loan assistant, perhaps not interested in smaller loan apps, very disappointing",1
Terrible PPP Lender.,Took over a month to process my 1st round PPP now I am trying to apply for the 2nd and cannot get anyone to contact me after numerous emails voicemails etc. This company is a joke. You would think bring the loan is only available until it runs out the customer service would be just a tad bit better than this. Hopefully week 3 of trying to reach someone will be better!,1
I've never seen a company that goes to…,"None of my assigned funding managers have responded to my emails. I applied January 13 and today is February 26 with no answers. My homepage, which would list offers, says my application is incomplete but when I chat with a representative they tell me everything is fine. I have submitted every document multiple times. This has been a stressful experience and being a self employed hair stylist under incredible restrictions, I don’t even know that I will be approved for a loan I desperately need.Edited 17 days after review. STILL WAITING FOR MY PPP LOAN. There has been some communication from the  funding manager but no answers. Asking to please be patient. I applied January 13 and STILL waiting on an answer. The deadline is approaching and no one seems to be helping further along this process.",1
Absolutely terrible experience,"O lord, I hope I have not gotten myself into a big prob. I just referred my women group to use them and I dad file two days ago.

So I am d president of single mums in diaspora,and they are mostly registered business owners . Now I just sent them an email to hold off. How do I withdraw my application. I can't start with negative company,from the moment I submitted all they keep saying is we will request additional documents if need be. Why predict that,why not predict the lender will accept it and we will try. B",1
Not responsive and holding up the process...,DO NOT APPLY FOR A PPP WITH LENDIO!!!  I'm sick and tired of getting the run around from this company!!!  I applied over a month ago and you immediately reserved a SBA Loan number so that I can not apply anywhere else.  That is about the only thing you are good at!!!  No communication what so ever!  Will not respond to emails or answer the phone!  My application is saying sent to lender in the portal.  I call the lender (who actually answers the phone) and they are still waiting on Lendio!!!  The lender is saying that I still have to sign documents with Lendio before it is sent to them.  Please release my SBA Loan number or tell me the steps to take so that I can apply elsewhere.,1
I applied for our PPP on 2/3 with…,"My experience with Lendio has not been a great one however one of the companies team lead did reach out to try and rectify the situation. The team lead explained  what happen took ownership for the failed communication and that was good enough for me, we all make mistakes. I am willing to move on.",1
Terrible. Would not recommend.,"on 2/11/21 I applied for ppp loan through Lendio and was submitted.  On the same day my Identity (social security, business account #) was compromised.  On the same day they opened and have attempted to open up accounts online and were in process of transfering funds from my business account.  I have to worry about this for the rest of my life.I have called and e-mailed Lendio several occasion about this issue and have not heard back.  At the onset I was trying to research the issue and make Lendio aware of this issue in case other applicants may face the same problem and but I have not heard back after two weeks.In addition, when asking about the status of my application, I am getting the same response which is no response.",1
This is has been a nightmare. WOW.,"Update as of 3/2/2021: Lendio never tried to reach out to me despite there comment on this review, I continued to email, message, and call and still no return. I researched thru SBA site and found a local bank accepting PPP applications and was funded in less than 48hrs. There is no excuse for Lendio having my application for 6 weeks and changing my submit date several times to buy themselves time and no excuse for them sitting on it with an SBA approval number for over 2 weeks and they had all the correct paperwork to fund me. 1st time around with PPP loan they were on it and it went smoothly. This 2nd round has been nothing but chaos!! I've submitted the same paperwork to them countless times and each time they change my paperwork date. They sent my stuff to lender and lender kept requesting the paperwork and now they declined my app I called lender funding circle and they said they didn't have my app. Lendio will not respond back and now my app is sitting there with the status sent to lender and the SBA has already issued an approval and loan number. So much for the required 10days from SBA approval!! Heard they are only focusing on high dollar PPP loans and selling to the highest bidder. Forget us small businesses",1
STAY AWAY FROM LENDIO! Nightmare!!,I have been trying to speak with someone about my ppp lending for weeks and haven't gotten any answers or responses at all.EDIT AFTER RESPONSE:Yes I spoke with someone through your online chat system on 2/23 about not hearing anything about my first ppp draw for weeks after I signed my documentation. They said they spoke to their manager about escalating my issue then they signed off and I have heard nothing since. I am not applying for a second draw I am still in the process of my first draw. Please call or email me.,1
Applied for second PPP loan through…,"1st draw PPP-applied day one in January 2021. Multiple emails received stating my app was deleted and i needed to reapply. I did, after 45 days of “application sent to lender status.” I started emailing. One person stated my schedule C wasn’t attached, it was. 60 days later I emailed daily and never heard back so I withdrew my application. Don’t waste your time if your a true small business.*reply to your response.. i did not obtain funding yet after wasting 2 months with Lendio",1
AVOID Lendio!!,"We applied for a PPP loan through Lendio. From the beginning, the process was disorganized, the user interface was frustrating, and communication was lacking. They repeatedly asked me to upload documents I had already uploaded, and when I would reach to them by email or phone to clarify what was missing, there was no response. Although we did eventually get our loan, the process was not transparent, and AFTER we had received the loan in our bank account we received an email asking us to resubmit everything again with a new signature, which made no sense at all. I wouldn't recommend any business owners apply for a loan through Lendio until they've figured out their user interface and customer service.",1
I began my application on January 26th…,"Lendio = waste of time and resources during a time every second count!  Lendio has successfully provided the WORST experience ever!  I was approved, accepted the offer was waiting for the lender to contact me then started seeing on the Lendio website that my app was ""withdrawn"" and that I was marked as ""no contact"".  I did not withdraw my application and I did not ask to be put on a no-contact list.  Noone at Lendio can tell me how or why this happened.  They do not return my calls, chat messages or emails.  I am resourceful but can not find a soul at Lendio that gives 2 cents about me, my business, or providing answers.  I am a 23 year professional with good credit.  I just don't understand how this behavior can be allowed to go on and on - as I have seen in other posts as well and nothing is done about it.  Karma is a .....well, you know.UPDATE:  Lendio I received your responses however, I require a detail explanation of exactly why I was so completely ditched by Lendio. I already have other financing approved however, it CANNOT move forward because I have an active app witH LENDIO. Again, my next steps depend on yours...03022021 Today I decided to take a different approach:Dear SBA –I am truly at my wits end. I applied for a PPPII loan through Lendio. I was made an offer, accepted it and was told I’d hear from my lender soon. I understand the Lender was to be Benworth. Next thing I know there is a message on the Lendio site that my app has been withdrawn – I did not withdraw it. Then when I tried to login to Lendio’s site but could not - I received a “no contact” message. I was able to login through Facebook and my application is gone. I’ve emailed Lendio so many times, left phone messages and tried on Social Media to contact Lendio. I have been given no response as to why all of this happened. The lender quit talking to me too. I am so confused and disgusted.I applied through my credit union was approved and they were ready to fund but said SBA is kicking back my app because the Lendio app is still showing in the system.I am a professional with good credit. Please tell me what to do. Is there is a formal complaint process?Mary Garlock",2
10 DIFFERENT representatives in 30 days,"Applied for PPP and was approved and received SBA number on 2/3. Signed Promissory note on 2/16. Still am not funded. Benworth hasn’t called nor given any sort of an acceptable timeframe.Update 3/2/2021:Still not funded.Alfredo with Benworth said my application was accidently canceled on 2/25, he assured me he would take care of this and to allow him 2 business days.  I did get a call back from Landon with Lendio in response to my review here letting me know that he would be reaching out to the lender to check on this.Yesterday 3/1:I emailed Alfredo back with Benworth to check on the status, he states they are waiting on Lendio to reinstate my loan. He then tells me with the new rules I can get more money if I start a new application and then I can let him know. I said no. It would only be $300 dollars more and we are a month in on my current application.I then used the Lendio chat with Donna asking about the status of my loan, she asked if my email address changed that she sent for a agent to reach out to me. That was after 30 minutes of no response.I then also forwarded my email chain between Alfredo with Benworth and I to my funding manager Robert with Lendio. That went as follows2/22 Benworth(Alfredo) asked for tax return for 2019.2/23 replied to make sure he received my 2019 tax return and where in processing is he.2/24 Response Stating my 2019 tax return doesn’t have a schedule C.I Responded that is correct, that I just started the end of 2019 as a independent contractor and didn’t make enough to get a 1099. So I sent him my 2020 schedule C.2/25 I sent another email Alfredo asking what is going on. That now on CAWEB.SBA.GOV shows fully cancled for my loan status. He said it was canceled by error. He could reinstate my application however he would need my bank statements in order to process my loan. I sent those and he said to allow him 2 business days to reinstate my application.Now I used the Lendio chat and was told that its noted on 2/17 they needed my tax return. I said well that can not be right, she offered to have my funding manager contact me.In my review nobody has any idea whats going on. The only thing I can trust is the SBA website showing my loan as fully canceled.This has been the longest month and I am no where near funding.",1
I applied with them back in February,I applied for a PPP loan for my business using Lendio and it has been a horrible experience.  They changed the loan amount on my application and submitted it to SBA without my approval.  Their calculations are completely off and do not match any of the paperwork I submitted.  I use ADP for all my reports so I do not know how they messed it up.  The worst part is that they did not even contact me to inform me of the changes so I never signed off on it.   I cancelled my application and my EIN needs to be released from the SBA database by Lendio so I can apply elsewhere.   I have repeatedly called and emailed and no one is responding.  I was working with Alex Enriquez and he is completely unresponsive.  It seems they are purposely doing this so I can't apply for a PPP loan elsewhere.  It's been weeks without any response.  There are better options out there if you want good customer service.Update:  I found out that the funding manager deleted all my information from their database.  Probably because to hide his mistakes and shady practice.  I still have not gotten a response from anyone from Lendio.  My business has a SBA Number with a lender that Lendio assigned to me that I do not even know who it is.,1
Complete and utter waste of time,"Negligent. Applied over a Month ago for PPP loan 2.  Every week we asked for updates, was told it was in processing.  Finally we started pushing more they asked for documents already submitted.  Unbelievable.  We are forced to apply with another legitimate “lender”. Lendio is a waste of time and horrible service if you could reach someone.  Would not recommend.",1
poor customer service when dealing with…,"I took almost a month to pass my first round of PPP. Many times I tried to contact the agent assigned to my account never got a response.

It gives me error that it does not match the first round loan number. I called lendio and also emailed but got no response. I am constantly receiving emails to leave a review but not about how to resolving my problem.",1
Took over a month to process my 1st…,"If I could give 0 stars I would. I'm not one to leave negative reviews but I have to warn people about this one. Lendio is the absolute worst.

I have been bounced around from loan manager to loan manager, each new rep telling me that my application is ""missing information."" I have submitted that ""missing info"" to each new rep that asked about it within 2 hours tops, and each time they've told me my application was now submitted to the SBA. Only for the cycle to continue over and over and over again. And now, I've just gotten an email from them saying ""it's been a while since we've heard from you- we are going to withdraw your application in 24 hours if we don't hear back."" Absolute worst experience I've had with a company professionally. 0/10 would absolutely NOT recommend.",1
Poor communication with no explanation,"Unfortunately there wasn’t  a negative—5stars. This is my second attempt with Lendio and the first time was a joke. This time through is even WORSE! No response what so ever, you call and get disconnected, no way to communicate other that this stupid chat BS. Then you get some generic response. NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY FOR YOU PPP LOANS! This company says the have great reviews, how is that possible. The small businesses like myself are getting the short end of the stick!Phil Malgren",1
Hope I have  not messed my up,"TERRIBLE COMPANY TO DEAL WITH! I'm sure all of the 5 star reviews are fake! During a time such as this, Lendio only wants to play games with you!

Can not get in touch with anyone, they never answer the phone and never respond to emails! Per SBA guidelines, the loan is supposed to be funded within 10 days of assigning a loan number.

Lendio: it took 37 days to get funded, Other institutions: Friends said it took only 3 to 5 days.2. Poor associate systemAssigned associates have been changed twice: The First person: never answer calls, texts, and emails. The second person: I had a phone call with this person, but I was told that he is not the assigned associate even though it says so on the website. Result: No one to contact.",1

I initiated every contact to check status and at each call they would tell me they were waiting on some document from me. I would otherwise not have any idea because their online system would state all documents were turned in and completed. Also, I started off with one person and went through four different staff members before it was all said and done. I would have liked to have known that before the process started as I felt passed around.

I'd ask Lendio a question, get an answer, then when I'd bring it up to the current lender, think I'm on like number 10 now, I'd get a different answer from them.  I've downloaded documents after documents,  often the same ones.   I was even told by one lender that my income from my business was so small for any lender to want to help.  I have officially just excepted the fact that I will not get help.UPDATE...talked to 2 or 3 more people.  Did get an email saying that my application was finally sent to a lender & I should receive a response in 24-48 hours.  That was a week or more ago & no more news.

Now they want us to verify our address, but they already have our address on five different pieces of documentation and they're saying the need it yet again! I've called, texted, and emailed the account manager (of which we have had multiple) and no one will ever get back to us. This is at least third account manager we've had, and she (nor the others) ever respond.I'm concerned if this loan will ever get funded. I can't ever speak with anyone who knows what's going on.

I expressed that I did not and asked specifically for a solution or options. Should be easy.. resend or try another email. Then they went ""dark"" the rest of the day.   I've had no response from Customer Experience member since the text on Sunday morning.Once again, trying to be patient...  the angst of the news and the stress of not receiving them. Coupled with ambiguously sparse communication from Lendio.  Does test one's patience, not to mention raises questions.I'm really hoping for something tomorrow. ( 2 Stars)2/23- Mid morning update.  No word from 2nd funding manager nor the Customer Experience member.   The online portal did update, showing I've been assigned my THIRD ""funding manager"".  This is either progression or blatant ""C.C""..  Sending email & text to new funding manager now...Update 2/27:  RECIEVED CONTRACT FOR SIGNATURES!!   (Last step funding...)Update 3/4-  Still have not received funds, a week later.  3 other reps.  Initially told 3-5 days, then 7 it is now 7 and not much correspondence.  Still being patient.  I believe the bank has 10days to fund, once you've received the SBA loan# ?Update 3/6- Received a text saying new manager was going to give me an update.  Never did..  Nor responded to my additional texts.Update 3/8-  No funds, still not much communication at all. it's been 13 Calendar days since signing docs. Starting to question the validity of the contract I signed and regretting not going with my personal bank.  Who have now closed their PPP app...  smh...Update 3/9- still not a word ( multiple emails, texts and a voicemail)Update 3/10- Finally received an email saying there was a mistake on the signatures and I needed to resign and a request was sent to the lender to resend documents. Update 3/11-  multiple emails, text as well as a phone call sent.  No word.Update 3/12-  once again.  multiple emails, texts and voicemails and no response.   Received text just before 5pm informing to look in my email for the signature docs.  nothing..3/15- multiple emails and texts sent and phones.  Zero response.I've never experienced this level of horrendous service before.  SOOOOOO FRUSTRATING, to be waiting for an email for almost an entire week and having been sent only one update via text.3/16- Received email @ 945am, saying lender was sending email.  Received new signature email, as well as a phone call from an executive with lendio.  Explaining the situation as well as apologizing for the delay.  Greatly appreciated.  Excited to finally resign the Docs.  DOCS SIGNED3/22-  Still Have not received funds.  Rather alarming as I log into my Lendio account, and what said approved, with an SBA number ( that I signed a loan agreement for on 3/16 with the bank)  now says Received 3/10 Under review with no SBA number, it looks like everything started over?   3/25- STILL NOTHING!!3/29-  PROMISED A RETURN CALL with an update after realizing they screwed up by failing to submit documents they had and already submitted.3/31- still crickets",1
TERRIBLE COMPANY TO DEAL WITH!,Customer service and business model for funding time frames are poor and inaccurate.Update 03/01/2021: I still have not received any nor have I been able to receive a proper response from any VP on the SBA government Lending team at Customers Bank. Can someone from the executive board please reach out to assist. We are a small veteran own business try to survive in uncertain times.,1
I have been waiting for my closing…,No communication. Submitted PPP application on 01/31/2021 and SBA approved on 2/1/2021.17 days later nothing. Absolutely nothing. Victor will not answer emails says I was at funding desk on 2/11/2021. Legacy bank is lender. Very disappointed. Will not recommend.The response from Lendio for my post is what they always say when they do respond but never respond with any info.***02/19/2021***Still nothing. I have reached out to these everyday since they were issued a SBA number for my PPP loan. NOTHING EXCEPT THE SAME RESPONSE.WAIT FOE EMAIL. THE WORST!!!!WHOMEVER IS LEAVING 5 STAR REVIEWS IS FAKE!!!,1
"Poor process speed, irresponsible associates",Points of contact changing continuously.  The exact same data being requested over and over. Emails coming across with single sentence with no context.  Completely disorganized process.,1
lendio wont withdraw our application,"I applied for the second round of PPP through Lendio after my bank opted not to process round 2 loans. So far the experience has been terrible. From minor things like website issues to major things like getting a denial letter for reasons that made no sense that was later deemed a mistake. Now I’m in loan purgatory having attempted to follow up with my loan admin 6 times. They’ve lowered the loan amount inexplicably, but without informing me. I’m trying to get it reviewed but all I get is “someone will call you” which has yet to actually happen despite having followed up 3 times. I’m shocked this is how they treat clients let alone small business who are depending on this relief to survive the pandemic. I’m nervous that I might not get the loan due to their incompetence even though I applied on the very first day it was open to second draw businesses.",1
In base of my income I qualified for…,"Got the idea to use Lendio from ""The Hartford"" I clicked through filled out all the data and submitted...nothing....then I was told I needed to send documents that I had already sent. Every day up to 3x a day I got an email sent saying my application was incomplete. When I would log on...it said ""complete."" There was noone to reach out to. Then finally I got a call from a Joenathan.He asked me to upload further information...I dont know why....then silence...no emails as promised or updates on the site...still the same your application needs attention. Then out of the blue, I got a text and he said I was eligible for double what I put down and would he like me to adjust my figures. I said yes and then silence. 3 days later my application had again been reset. Online person said my figures were wrong so I completed the application again. Joenathan was nowhere to be found. I emailed, called and texted...nothing. Now I was exasperated and my bank decided to start offering so  I was going to drop Lendio. I told the online person how frustrated I have been with the whole process. Finally it moved to approved by the SBA so I was stuck...then I waited for the paperwork which came. This whole process has taken me over 6 weeks. Time to complete form and submit has been an hour. One of the worst experiences I have had. Further...no way to respond to the reply from Lendio they dont acknowedge the bugs in their system nor the fact their agents dont answer you back. Its a one way street. Yes I finally got the money but since I was tied into the situation there was little else I could do but follow it through. In short...it was a mess...if you like messes go right ahead and apply with them but if you think they are a partner...think again",1
No communication and I am still in the…,Follow up! Again Lendio. Is requiring a 2020 draft  for tax returns. If you haven't filed your 2020 tax returns in February then you are out of luck. Non of this was required when submitted your application. They are holding applications and your SBA # to make you file your returns early than you anticipated to. I submitted my first app in early January. They are a joke. Making rules as they go.,1
Several of the chat people were rude…,Follow up Review! Lendio has now given me at least nine different funding managers. They are going through the same documents. The last one ask me for a Draft of my 2020 tax returns and I haven't even filed you February 15th. 2021 the IRS just official opened up to receive returns for 2020. They are not following the Guideline for the PPP stimulus.  They have all they need for a sole business owner with no employees in 2020. They do not know what they are doing. Please do not send your personal information if you have no schedule C in 2020. My business again opened January 2020. This company dont care. They give a good impression until they get your documents. Good luck!!!,2
Y’all keep saying I got funded $5000…,"After submitting all the proper paperwork, I continued to get emails and text that they needed the paperwork that I had uploaded. Then I got paperwork to close on the loan, which was signed and submitted. Then continued to get emails to resubmit all the paperwork I had uploaded. Then got emails telling me I was funded but DID NOT GET THE MONEY, Very concerned and no one seems to call back with any information to assist or clarify",1
While I ended up getting a loan from…,"This review is because they sent me out an email asking me to review them, so here we go...Avoid them. I've been strung along for a few weeks, communication has been terrible, and the only time  I can actually reach anybody for any update is by harassing them with phone calls until they eventually answer.  Funding managers don't return emails aland rarely voicemails.  Each time it's been a new funding manager who is even more clueless than the previous.They're asking me to review them before they've even saw to it that my account was actually funded.  It was approved by the SBA 2 weeks ago and still not funding.  That's seems very typical of something they would do, so here's your 1 start review.  You sure earned it.I regret using Lendio.",2
I would not recommend,Well so far my experience has been terrible with Lendio.  Seemed like a good idea.  One application that goes out to a whole lot of lenders for our PPP loan.  Well in 3.5 weeks we have had 4 different loan managers and NOBODY responds to e-mails or phone calls.  I read all of the rave reviews and thing they must be fake given my terrible experience.,1
Horrible Service.,I applied for a PPP loan with Lendio.  They sat on my application for three weeks and asked for the same documents five times.  I uploaded them each time from my payroll processing company and they just could not figure out how to process the application of a business that uses a PEO.  What a waste of time and effort.,1
Still No Help After Several Months,"I am offering 2 stars but at this point I am not really sure if this is accurate. I have received several emails for requests for information I have already submitted. I was asked for a report that does not apply to me and with that being the last request, I am not sure if my application is being worked on or wondering if I should go elsewhere. I went to check the status of my process and I cannot see any of the documents I uploaded. I only wish I could speak to someone and find out what is going on. Our business needs the money so very much and if I just knew what was happening and it was accurate would be great.",1
feel like my ppp app is going no where,"Lendio is HORRIBLE to deal with. I will give examples.   First we applied for second draw last week in January and we are still waiting,6 different people have texted us for information, the exact same information, these 6 people do not answer their phones or texts, they sent us texts at 130 in the morning, they kept demanding documents that were not needed,the last person we were texting was Daniel Flowers at Lendio, once we started questioning him after talking to our tax preparer and SBA he has cut his phone off and will not respond.We don’t know how much money was requested for funding, we don’t know where our information is,  we don’t even know if our application has actually been sent to funding,and l could keep going on. We have reached out to the Lendio liasion. Will update",1
Our experience with Lendio has been awful!,"I applied For ppp. They switched my funding manager, 5 times before it was approved. Every time i emailed And never could get through on the phone. The chat feature was only way to contact anyone. I applied Back in august and just got funded in February. I would Try multiple different lender",1
applied for second round ppp you would…,"Lendio! You guys are so unorganized. My Funding Manager changes everyday. I gave had Eight and still at Ground Zero. They are verifying the same information over and over but nothing is being done. I dont have a schedule C. I opened January 2020. No Employees. You all have my tax returns, bank statements and IDs. I am complaining through BBB. You guys have made a mess with a simple process. I am sure the funds are gone by now. Thanks for Nothing",1
"black hole DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!!!  LOOK UP BBB REVIEWS PRIOR! SCAM, USE  YOUR OWN BANK!!","Nobody to talk to. Tried many times to talk to someone but no reply. I applied with 2 banks to be safe. One cleared under writing and was submitted to SBA, only to rejected because Lendio submitted to SBA without doing underwriting or anything else. I have spent so much time trying to contact someone but don’t hear back. I can’t apply anywhere else because they got an SBA number. Applying with Lendio was a huge mistake.",1
Customer service PPP lost funds?,Bill has been nice to work with. My personal experience was a few expected false starts out of the gate followed by a reservation number and final documents signed 21 days ago. No funding as of yet. Had better experience with US Bank on first round.,2
No communication. The worst customer service!!!,"I normally deal with American Express but since they referred me to Lendio, I thought to give it a try. I mean, Amex putting themselves out there for another company “must” mean that they are respected. During my application for the PPP for my business, I see a funding manager at the end of the page with a phone number if I had questions. I called 3 different people and none of them answered my call or returned my message. The chat box was even hard to get a response. I would ask a question and on some occasions wait 10 minutes for a response and still not answering the question that I asked.  Today, I’m waiting for the SBA Loan to be deposited into my business which hasn’t arrived yet and today makes day number 9 from date of receiving my SBA Loan number. I hope I don’t encounter any problems tomorrow which is the 10th day because I know that I’ll have even more problems trying to speak to someone from Lendio. Oh, and I’m still waiting for return calls and responses. I hope this helps you.",1
Points of contact changing…,Quick process. But it’s been 5 days since I’ve signed the documents and sent a voided check. Still no funds,1
No faith in Lendio,The initial process was pretty easy but I signed documents 10 days ago and my loan has still not funded. I was told it could take up to 10 business days. This is unacceptable.  Update. I did receive funds the night I posted this review. I received a call from Lending explaining the reason it took so long...and then asked me to update my review.,1
Go elsewhere,Overall I can't rate my experience yet because I am still in the process but I applied on January 13th I believe and since than not much has happened. Recently a few weeks ago my dashboard stated my application was approved thru Ready Capital and I was assigned a spa loan number. I have not heard a word from a rep or received anything communication since. My funding managers keep changing and I have written all of them without any response.  I am starting to wonder now because of the lack of communication if my loan will even be funded.,1
Follow up,"An agent kept calling and texting for more and more information, and she could barely speak English...I could hardly understand her English at all.  I speak 7 languages, so I'm used to accents.",2
Follow up Review,I been trying my first ppp from here 3 weeks ago and nothing processing. No answer phone call and no reply email,2
After submitting all the proper…,"My ""case manager"", or whatever they are called was changed multiple times. Zero contact phone numbers worked for anyone. Zero emails or texts were returned and I was never contacted by anyone despite consistently reaching out to have questions answered...questions I still have. I also kept receiving texts and emails that my application was incomplete (it wasn't) and that I needed to hurry because the funds would run out soon.  Despite all these emails and texts, absolutely no one answered my calls or emails. I'm still not sure whats going on. I received an SBA loan number and signed loan docs on 1/27....I still haven't received funds and I still have questions.  I never write negative reviews for any company, but this needed to be said.",1
Avoid,"I’ve had my application with lendio ready to go since the last distribution of ppp funds in june. Numerous times, the system told me the application was complete and ready for submission with SBA. for some reason Colleen Cunningham was not able to process it ... she repeatedly kept asking me to download the same documents over and over and finally in NOVEMBER when I voiced my frustration to her , she threatened to pull my application. She decided playing a game with me was funny to her, instead of helping and giving guidance as her collegues do. Numerous times I reached out asking what she specifically needed and every reply was a rude and snarky remark and did not answer the question or just request the same documents that were already in the system. miraculously, Sonny my liason for this round was able to get me approved within 2 wks . I’m thankful for that , however from June till now was Far more stressful than I needed it to beI’ve been in business for 35yrs and am a creative business woman, which is why My child care center is still standing today.  Lendio is only as good as it’s “knowledgeable “ employees. Colleen Cunningham is clearly incompetent at her job, is burnt out and a threat to all small businesses seeking help and guidance. She should be removed from her role immediately.",2
Well so far my experience has been terrible,Still waiting for them to help fix my application. I keep on updating it and it doesn’t update. I’ve called and no one has been there to help,1
PPP Experience,"The experience was nice on the first day with the filing of the additional paperwork. After the first day we have not been able to get any communication with Lendio. They have verified acceptance of all their required documentation. And since we haven't gotten an email or a call, and can't get through on any of the numbers they gave us. We are a profitable, vetted, small business, in need of these funds dearly. We are veteran owned. We qualify for the loan, we kindly ask someone to look into our file. That was weeks ago. Help?",1
I am offering 2 stars but at this point…,"Submitted docs on 1/8.  After two weeks, changed funding agent on 1/29 and was asked for two additional docs which I provided on that day. Since then my status of gathering all the documents has stayed the same.  I reached out to be told ""It takes time.""  I am a very very small business.  I have four friends who began their application process well after I did.  Each one has been approved and two have already been funded.   I really feel as though because I am a so small, I am being ignored.ADDITION ---Lendio did a terrible job. If anyone is reading this please beware. They put my application through Ready Capital, a company that has the worst ratings on Trustpilot, Reddit, Yelp, etc.  They jerked my case around for weeks, asking of the same documents over and over.   Moreover, they put my sensitive information in another company's portal. There is no way to communicate with them. Lendio took ZERO responsibility. Each agent that I was eventually able to reach told me there was nothing they could do. I started this process on 1/8/21 and her I am two months later and nothing. This is for one employee -- one.Lendio should have their hands slapped for using such a shoddy operation such as Ready Capital. I have gone to the media. If anyone else is interested, post and I will reach out.!",2
Lendio is HORRIBLE to deal with,They asked me to load the same doc over 5 times. Ask me over and over. Wont reply to any of my emails. Should have not wasted my time. Worse experience ever.,1
I applied For ppp,"Horrible communication throughout the entire process. Never received an email saying our docs were in order, app was sent to SBA or approved. Never have received a response to numerous emails and phone calls. Website still says ""we are moving it into processing"" even though our loan was funded and we still don't have any information about who the lender is or how to contact them. The only reason I gave two starts is that we did end up receiving our 2nd round PPP (but even then it wasn't for the correct amount based upon our verified payroll).Update 3/17/2021: Still no contact from Lendio or the Lender. No one is answering the Lendio phones and Lender has no listed phone number. We have our money but no way to communicate with the Lender, see statements or anything substantive.",1
Lendio,"I was extremely sketchy about using Lendio, but honestly if I didn't I would be really upset with myself. I applied on January 24th 2021 for the PPP SECOND DRAW and I must say Im extremely happy about the outcome. I applied on the 24th got approved on the 30th and had my SBA loan number by February 1st. Now I'm just waiting on them to fund me. I applied with another company and my application is still on the first step. Smh. The only reason I can not give Lendio 5 stars is because I had to keep login into my account everyday to check on the status and steps on my application. As I was moving up in steps I expected to receive some type of communication from them at least by email of my process but I did not receive on email. The only email I received was when they had to send my contract to sign my promissory note. But other then that the process was quick and easy and would recommend this company 100%. In the future if I'm ever in need for my business or personally i will come here first.Now I have to update my review.It is now March 23rd, I have yet to be funded and I have called 3 times a week since February 15th and I have yet to be funded eventho my account says funded since February 1st. Everytime I call they expedite my case and I've have yet to hear anything back from anybody. Nobody can find a reason to why I haven't been funded but nobody will not figure out when I will be funded.  This is absurd and ridiculous. They have escalate my case at least 40 times nothing. I can't get a email, phone call or  a text. NOTHING..... I've  called Customers Bank and they have told me time and time again to call Lendio they are the hold up. I'm starting to feel like I've been scammed or something. My funding manager was Maurice now its Autumn Stoop and neither one has reached out evetho I have emailed them over and over again. I'm waiting on the SBA to email me back about them but is absolutely freaking insane.",2
Nobody to talk to,"Lendio was great for PPP Round 1, not so much for Round 2. I've gotten nothing but a runaround, a continuous change of Funding managers, and unhelpful customer service from their online chat. Janda Bouzakis was unhelpful just giving me a runaround, not even trying to answer my questions. I'm very disappointed this time with the service I've received from Lendio, and it's customer service people.",1
Bill has been nice to work with,"I've used 4 different PPP lenders.  Once you get docs in they never get back to you about funding.  You call and email and it's just silence.  It's been 9 days since docs signed and no word on funding.  Everyone else 4 to 5 days.in response, I will look for your call, but online it says ""processing"" and I havent received the email saying the loan has been funded",2
I normally deal with American Express…,The whole process has stalled and no one will even answer the phone or chat support.,2
Quick process but still no funds.,"Very frustrating. I was only contacted one time by a rep to ask if I was an LLC or sole P. Then I never heard back. 3 different people have been assigned to my loan. I have emailed, texted, and called each rep because I had some questions about uploading additional documents and and I wanted to make sure I was doing it all correctly. Its been about 2 weeks with no one ever responding.   Its very frustrating I don't know if I can recommend....Still no one has reached out.",2
The initial process was pretty easy but…,Nathan and Mariah with Lendio were super disorganized. They called me last week to verify my documents and were working off of 2019 file even though I supplied 2020.  They said a funding manager would call me.  I waited 7 days and no one called me.  This morning they would not work with me because they said I wasn't calm enough for them.  They are a joke and I cannot recommend them to anyone.,2
Undecided,"Had a great experience with Lendio on round 1 of PPP but a very poor experience with them on round 2 -- so much so that I went to the trouble of completing the application with another company.  I received multiple text messages from someone saying I needed to hurry and apply but when I replied to this person, they never responded.  I received contradictory emails from the company as well, one saying the application was incomplete, another saying it was in evaluation.  I contacted them 3 times to clarify -- and no response.  I recommend not using them",2
The worst company I've ever dealt with,"My experience with Lendio has been terrible in that I wasn't able to speak with anyone directly to ask my questions or get advise, the telephone numbers  given to me weren't functional. My account was passed from one person to another, this probably happened 3 or 4 times. Lendio's request for information was never clear or straightforward. All in all it was a very frustrating and unpleasant experience, My advise stay away!",1

Frustrating and Disappointing,"Too many confusion and too many agents agents never reply back to your email, text, or voicemail.  I called, texted, emailed my agents for 7 days straight and no reply.  I called corporate office and they contacted her and still no reply.  Worst service ever",2

Do not use just Lendio, since the first round their customer service declined beyond repair in my case.",1
"Started off nicely, and completely dropped all communication","This is a follow up review. I still haven't heard anything else about my loan. I understand that everyone is busy. I am started to accept not getting this first round business loan. I have left at least five messages and three Emails for Laina Letuli. I really believe they cant handle all the people. I believed in the videos they did on YouTube. But now i am losing hope in the words they spoke. At this point, I am sure the funds are gone. I put in my app on 1/4(early enough) put they didnt ask for documents until 1/11. I am disappointed. Its been so stressful. I will eventually get a business loan from my bank. My Credit is good and I am also a Travel RN with a small business.",1
Getting lost in the sauce,"We got a ppp loan through Lendio so we went back to them when we needed an SBA 7A Express Loan and we were assigned a funding manager named Devin Gambino. He seemed good at first. He said we were well qualified for the loan we were seeking and we went to work providing everything necessary. But then he then pushed a ""bridge loan"" on us for a portion of the funding we needed on us saying this will get you partial funding right away to get your manufacturing started and before the interest is due I will have your SBA loan to you and you will pay off the loan before the interest hits...Sounds great right? Well that was the end of Sept/early Oct. It's February and still no SBA loan. We provided Lendio with so much information over and over and for nothing. Instead we have the high interest merchant loan Devin called a “bridge loan“ deducting money weekly when we still need the funding we originally sought, so basically Devin cost us about 35k in interest and didn't deliver on the SBA Express loan we sought. My advice: Don't get ""Gambino'd."" Don't let someone like Devin Gambino sell you a high interest merchant loan with promises he can land you a low interest loan and quickly pay off the ""bridge loan"" before the high interest loan is due- it's a bridge to nowhere. If you do decide to do business with Lendio def don't get pressured into writing an early positive review of them(Devin did the full court press to write a review from the get go). Tell them you will reserve the review for when the deal is done and you know the results-instead of the promises.",2
They asked me to load the same doc over…,"I applied through lendio before the application was updated. I updated the very day it was available. I've been waiting for an email and decided to log in last night, only to find that my ""complete"" status has changed to ""incomplete"". I clicked on the review and it asked me AGAIN, ""did you receive a 1st PPP loan?"". I again clicked ""YES"" and then I got a message to apply through ""Bluevine"". GREAT....so I guess after waiting 2 weeks, I will start over and hope that funds are still available once Bluevine reviews my application. I though Lendio submitted my app to other lenders. I am so frustrated and just completely over this tiny bit of hope I had left. I have never been so stressed and dependent on something in my life. I passed out yesterday and came to with my kids screaming and my daughter on the phone with 911. Apparently stress can induce seizures and the EMT's suggest I reduce my stress level....Thanks Covid-19, Thanks Lendio and a special Thanks to our Government for your devistating response to this pandemic.",1
"Horrible communication through the process, finally got our PPP but with who?",I was having problems with my PPP application. Very helpful . Was able to immediately rectify and move smoothly thru the process . Laura from CX very good 👍 A+ I also spoke with another lady who called me I don't remember her name but very helpful as well. Great job!!! Notice the reply date . Jan 29th. Its Feb 12th. Haven't heard anything .This was almost a week ago. After 100 phone calls and text service rep  promised me I am golden ..  next day we need a copy of ur check.... Next day we need a document ... Next day we need a utility bill . After multiple multiple contacts they say they sent in my loan application . Today is Feb 12. Have heard nothing all week from lender. What a joke. My first review was based on what I thought was helpful step from lendio turns out it was not. Here I am over 10 days later wondering what the entire ...,1
Definitely would NOT recommend this company...,"Right now, my review is one-stars. It may change. Firstly, the application is continually evolving, and despite that, it is never updated to its full potential. The customer service e-mail system keeps sending me messages telling me that my application is incomplete although, I have uploaded everything requested. My lender keeps asking me for documents and telling me they are required, yet, the application doesn't have boxes to submit this material. For instance, the application says that uploading a voided check is optional. Ergo, I didn't upload one. The Lendio rep then called me and asked for it. Second, the application asks for a February 2020 bank statement, which I supplied. But the representative asked me for January 2020 also. Why not just make a box for this? Then, the rep called me for a payroll register. Independent contractors and people that do gig work don't have a payroll registry. They don't hire ADP to process a paycheck for themselves. It's absurd to even ask for it. Same with asking for 941's from small businesses that have no other employees but the owner.This is not very pleasant, as I am a second draw PPP requester. Everything needed to approve my round two was needed for round one, which they have. Nothing has changed, but me certifying that I earned 25% less revenue in 2020 than in 2019.If you're an independent business person with no employees, I suggest you avoid Lendio.",1
Lendio was great for PPP Round 1 not so much for Round 2.,"Terrible! I've submitted my application, they keep sending me a email that  ""Lendio reviewed your PPP application, and it’s missing critical information"". They don't even say what is missing. I've been updated my information and document again and again... for two weeks. They don't even answer the phone.  I just withdrawal my application and resubmitted to other company. I hope that I still have time to apply PPP....I totally wasted my time for TWO WEEKS !",2
I've used 4 different PPP lenders,"If your towed you have to make $24,000 in order to be approved it's totally false. Someone obviously needs to read the guidelines again. I know I'm tired of reading them I get misinformed and I have to go back and check it in the course I'm right so I'm going to start answering my own damn questions. This was supposed to be about the little guy this round looks like we're going to have to jump through more hoops. I'm not going to give up though. You can get a list of approved lenders at the SBA I would advise to do that. If you have any questions I can probably answer him better than they can cuz I had to read him so many times. Thanks for reading.Guess im not worth the time to call me and help. Or maybe thay dont known what thay R doing.. my personal opinion of them they suck take your business elsewhere apparently they don't care if they kicked me to somebody else cuz they either don't know how to answer I just don't want to answer my question just ain't got the time for the little guy???Im going straight to the head of the SBA about the situation.Not looking good on the second draw no one can answer my questions.",1
GOAT just kidding. Pun intended.,"I got some vague letter saying my application was missing critical info but no indication of what that was. I emailed them and was told they needed an SOS doc, BTR doc and approved identification. I didn't know what an SOS document was so I had to email them and ask. It stands for Secretary of State. I still don't know what that is.  I uploaded a picture of my driver license and they still ask for it again. Then the BTR. A couple of emails later and I find that it stands for Business Tax Return. I already uploaded it! Oh yeah. We found it. Ugh!Get your crap together folks!I was doing the paperwork for a PPP loan. I'm getting the feeling of the loan application part is this bad then the loan forgiveness part will be a nightmare. I'm going somewhere else. This feels like it is going to be worse than trying to cancel your cable TV where they send you to a dozen people hoping you will just give up.",1
Frustrated,"i was not sure of all the documents i needed , i submitted my application and was told that it was processing , and on the second contact i was told that my application was getting close to be summitted to a lender and that i should be getting an offer soon , and my case worker was going to reach out to me several times she told me this but never called , next thing my application was kicked out and was told i would receive a phone call never did , so im just guessing or wondering why i was just ignored",1
Nathan and Mariah with Lendio were…,"O forgot it was ready Capital that fix the situation readycap loans number one.. and lendio You do customers bad with no return phone calls unless they give you a bad review come on don't cry about it now do something before it goes bad ..Gave them a bad review someone called back immediately said someone would get in touch with me but this was last week I have a question what about the unemployment benefits I received how do I take off some of my bank statements that are probably incorrect wish I had someone to talk to about it must be nice to have a good experience with them I know they had my phone number and my email address what the hell. They must have laid people off between the first loan and the second draw. Expedited service doubt that. I think the last time filed with the SBA didn't take this long. And their website does not answer any questions like that if you're reading this lendio representative don't even ask me to take this down cuz it's nothing but 100% true if y'all don't want to do my loan let me know I'll go somewhere else need help. Thanks for reading...Ronald Brabandt. How could you have two different Specialists look over my application that is in complete. I need to know if I use my unemployment towards my income. And if I can't get bank statements from GreenDot which will not provide for January February what other documents can I use don't waste my time but be nice and someone new and I shouldn't have to even feel that part of it out I'm a sole proprietor that's only if the SBA ask for it in the future I don't want over $150,000 but that's something you have to read further guidelines that's nothing in their guidelines allowable documents and or do I claim unemployment insurance a Schedule C does not List It.",1
Had a great experience with Lendio on…,"**Update- Yes, so i changed my rating from 3 stars to 1 star. #1 they tried to blame the SBA for the delay. I dont respect liars. Especially when they so blatenly lie. Tried to say the SBA changed the PPP loan application and thats why my application is delayed but i talked to 3 other lenders who all say that is a lie.#2 Because of this, my application is still not processed when its was supposed to be expidited. Not only that, Lendio claims they are working hard and advocating for the small business owners. BUT i am a small business owner. And the advantage given to us by the government? Yea, Lendio just squandered it. So if all the PPP funding runs out before i get my loan, you better believe im going to raise ALOT of hell and report Lendio to the SBA because they did it on purpose and lied to cover it up. Im beyond pissed. STAY AWAY FROM LENDIO or you'll get screwed over like me. I should have known better because this was my second experience with Lendio and the first one was horrible as well.So far off to a rocky start already. What i really dont like is that the communication from them isnt all that great and they move kind of slow. I actually appreciate what they stand for. Ive heard of business owners who have indeed received business funding thanks to Lendio so they are definitely a reputable company that i really want to speak highly of its just hard when you've already had a not so good experience and now you see a red flag. I dont want to overreact. Im just feeling a little leary about the second chance im extending.I have a private Facebook group where my followers have been asking me who i recommend for the last few weeks and rthis week, we've all been sharing our experiences thus far. And because Lendio says they have relationships with 10 different CFI's, i recommended them to my followers so that those of us who are women minority business owners would have a reliable resource to get the advantage given to us un this second round of PPP funding. Whats got me feeling concerned is that people who went with other lenders who were on the SBA CFI list are already receiving their documents which is awesome news but the pattern of slow response is already emerging when communicating with Lendio and im PRAYIN that doesnt translate into a slower loan process like before because i am a minority women business owner and the SBA gave us a week advantage so i dont want to get sifted out of that headstart. I hate that i even have to feel this way. I wish i could feel confident in Lendio and thats a huge part of my disappointment. I was previously partnered with MBE which was the most HORRIBLE lender to get matched with the last time around so i was concerned about this whole chain of a relationship.Based on the conversations Ive participated in online, My personal top 2 options were Lendio and Kabbage. I hold Kabbage at a higher regard because just in this last week, the majority of people who have shared their experiences have said that Kabbage is prompt about responding to calls and emails. Last round, Kabbage processed many of their loans were in a week or less. But sadly, i know from experience that with Lendio, emails go unanswered and loans take much longer to be process, around 3 weeks if they use MBE based on mines and others experiences.Im giving 3 stars because its not like Lendio is horrible and i think the slowness is more attributed to the actual lender and not necessarily Lendio. MBE is definitely slow and VERY nonresponsive, but im hoping maybe they learned from their mistakes and hold ups during the first round and have implemented processes to be on top of it this time. The 2 star loss is the lack of communication so early in the process and not being able to really feel confident nor secure in choosing them. Ultimately, my decision to go back to Lendio was because its better logistically as was recommended because it makes the PPP application process quicker and easier as opposed to starting all over developing a relationship with a new company. But not having confidence that it will be a better experience than last time sucks out alot of the excitement i had going in to this.",2
Stay away from Lendio!,This company wasted my time.  I filled out all of the required information and was hoping to get a jump on the application process and was even assigned a representative.   They did not process my PPP loan application accurately and denied my application for things that were not pertaining to me. A huge disappointment and a waste of my time.,1
I am getting zero follow up,"I am very disappointed with Lendio, I applied to the second ppp loan as individual contractor, they told me I will get $1000 base on income on section c on my tax return. I provided all needed documents to receive the money, they never deposit the money. Later, they send me email that they have transfer me to different company 3 days before the PPP run out and that company didn't processing it either. Lendio gave the loans to people who lie and didn't need the money, but people like me who really needs it never got it.",1
Too many confusion and too many agents…,"Filled out an application with Lendio. The rep that walked through everything with me was helpful, and honest about prospects, and identified things that would help or harm my chances, and different financing types best suited for my needs. After the initial call, and a promise to hear back within 48 hours, there was no cantact for about 2 weeks. After that time, I received over 50 phone calls over the course of a week from generic name lenders, most of which after research are operated out of residential addresses. I was finally able to grill one of them enough to find that they got a file opened via lendio, and were following up. I've gotten it down to 2-3 bogus calls a day left, and am getting those off my back too, but its been a solidly terrible experience, and not even any real financing offers to show for it.",1
Loud Music,"Our representative, Kade Simmons (Sr. Director at Lendio), blatantly lied about the terms and conditions of our loan, urged us to sign the contract as quickly as possible (supposedly at the insistence of the lender) and then later refused to return any of our calls or messages after we discovered we had been completely lied to and misled. Throughout the entire process, Kade clearly and repeatedly assured us that the loan could be paid off early without penalty, which he knew was our number one prerequisite. We don't mind taking on the occasional high interest loan as long as there is no early payoff penalty since our monthly cashflow is high and we are always able to pay them off quickly. However, instead of the 15-month ~20% interest rate loan we were quoted, we instead ended up with a non-interest-bearing loan with a 35% fixed-sum fee to be paid in full no matter when the loan is paid off. We have received and quickly paid off several six-figure loans over the years, but this was our first time going through an intermediary such as Lendio. Unfortunately for us, we foolishly assumed that Lendio was acting in our best interests and, as a result, didn't vet the details as thoroughly as we normally would have. Lesson learned.",1
So far I have had 4 different loan…,I decided to use Lendio for my PPP loan based on all the positive reviews. My experience is not.  Applied in July and had to reach out myself in August for an update. Was told still waiting for list of approved PLP numbers (?!?) and would be notified as they came in. Had to reach out again in September.  Was only able to get any answers through the chat online.  Was this time told my application was now being processed by Kabbage and given their contact info. Kabbage did not have any record of my application.  Reached back out to lendio was told someone would contact me.  Waited  2 days with no contact. Called again was told it would be escalated to a mgr and would again have to wait for someone would contact me. I have no faith this will get resolved before the expiration of my application. Poor communication and disorganization. Very quick to point blame elsewhere instead of accepting responsibility and working to resolve issues.,1
