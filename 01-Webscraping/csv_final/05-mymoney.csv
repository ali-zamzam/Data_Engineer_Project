They need to tell customer's when they apply for a loan that the office will be shutting down starting at 4 in the afternoon and won't be available till after 4:30. I was not expecting this at all. I had to rush to the bank because of this. I also was unaware of the fact that they require collateral for the loan.

Loan renewal Fast,"What is great you can borrow money with a monthly pay back. During the time of your loan, you make timely payments and every second or third month, you are offered more money without affecting your monthly payment. Monthly payment stays same. If you are elderly and living on limited income this is great loan company.",5
Spectacular service,When I opened this loan account I was told that there would be insurance attached for if I ever lost my job or became disabled. I did in fact lose my job and contacted the company. I was told to come in and fill out paperwork and my loan payments would be taken care of until I returned to work. After a whole month since the time I notified the company of unemployment and was waiting for help on this I was told that I now owe two payments because I wasn‚Äôt out of work long enough. They even tried to tell me that my payment would be considered only once and I could not be late again without paying in full and I had a late payment. What a way to put your customer in a bind. I would NOT suggest ever doing business with this company!,5

Nice people,Covington Credit offered a decent amount of money and gave a reasonable amount to re-pay. They don't have a Catastrophic 257% interest like some absurd lending companies. They're VERY fair with monthly payments. As long as you maintain them then there's no problem. Every year as long as you're a good customer there's a chance to raise what you can borrow. Naturally that means a higher payment but you don't Have to accept any increases and should only accept what you can responsibly afford. They report one-time payments so I guess that actually helps your credit rating over time with the Bureaus. Exceptional staff too!!!,5

Amanda was very helpful and made entire‚Ä¶,"This is probably one of the worst experience I had.  I see other people giving 5 stars, which I'm very surprised.  Either they didn't deal with lady I dealt with or there is a reason why this lady was very rude to me.  The loan I received was only $385 and she asked for a credit card statement, my car insurance statement, all with my address on them.  She also asked for my check stub, which is normal, but since it didn't show YTD on my check stubs, she got rude about it.  It seemed like she did not want to give me a loan, probably thought she could be rude to me since she could say yes or no to the loan.  So, I had to talk to her supervisor about what was going on.  I told her supervisor that I have given her all the paperwork she asked for, I did not question why she wanted my car insurance and a credit card statement, which nobody asks for.  The supervisor was very nice and professional and apologized for this ladies attitude.  The supervisor asked me to make screenshots and to bring up my work app, which has the check stubs.  So, I logged into the app and let that lady look at the check stubs.  Then she said that she could not use it since the company name and my name and address would not show up of she tried to print it.  It seemed like she was trying to find a reason to not give me a $385 loan, again, a $385 loan.  It wasn't like I was getting a $5000 loan.  So, I had to go into my works intranet and show her my check stubs from there, it was well after their closing hours when we were going through this.  So, when I showed her those check stubs and she made screenshots, she said she couldn't send them to her email, she said the email network was messing up.  Like I said, it seemed like she didn't want to give me a $385 loan, again, a $385 loan, lol.  Her supervisor told her to send it to her email address, which went through.  So, after I made my screenshots of my car insurance and emailed to her supervisor, that's when I finally got my $385 loan.  That is why I'm surprised this place got 5 stars.  She could have had a bad day, I don't know, but she had that attitude that she could be anyway towards me.  I'm just glad I was able to talk to her supervisor.  This lady doesn't need to be dealing with customers with that kind of attitude, not nice at all.  This is why I'm surprised this place got 5 Starz from more than one person, and all I got for a loan was $385.  I went through all that for $385, even if it was for $2000, her attitude should not have been that way.",5

A glimpse at Customer Satisfaction,"I signed my requisite paperwork last Friday before the 11 am cut-off. Appears that the corporate office suffered some sort of power failure on Friday afternoon and they could not complete the transfer on Friday before 5 pm. Monday was a Federal Holiday and I was told that the deposit would be made prior to the end of the business day on Tuesday. It is now Tuesday evening at 9:00 pm and still there is no sign of a deposit. I called the Perrin-Beitel office in San Antonio at 5 pm and was informed they would need to put in a ‚Äúticket‚Äù. That is there answer to everything, a ‚Äúticket‚Äù to the corporate office, as they don‚Äôt want to pick up the phone to call a higher authority. I informed them that I wished to cancel the loan because of their woeful inability to perform. The mindless response being, we‚Äôll put in a ticket in the morning. The overall employee talent pool is quite shallow, but obviously the incompetence begins much higher in the corporate pecking order. Don‚Äôt walk‚Ä¶run from this company!",5

Secondly, most loans take atleast a year(or more) to pay off, however they have 7 month loans.  Third they report to all 3 Bureaus, helping improve your credit efficiently!! 4th They offer a $30.00 referrals  and last but most definitely NOT least they have THE SWEETEST, KIND, COMPASSIONATE staff whom also are very efficient  and they help you get through the  process faster than others i have worked with...The name ""QUICK CREDIT "" is perfect!

My experience with  the branch in‚Ä¶,I took out a loan at Covington Credit the staff was very nice I had a few issues but in time I want to add them out apparently I didn't like the collateral listing it was just way too much to me and I wish today submitted you cash instead of a check because you have to go get that either if you don't have a bank account have it cash which actually will cost you so I don't like that factor but I do like the fact that they do report your account to the credit bureau and with this that means that you can build your credit with this company and increase your score which I really like of course as long as you pay your bill on time one other factor I didn't really like or understand I have no access to actual documents they don't give me any documents and it's not like you can go online and download them either up alone I would like to have had that but she did say she will mail them so hopefully that'll happen but other than that it is a great place especially if you want to just find a place to really build your credit but just be aware that the loans are expensive and that is a factor to look at other than that it was okay deal,5

And my 99 was due on the 21 st co I call DestiNY was there so 5I save what I have with you guys she told me to bring in $99.00 a,d get there before 5:00 I got there 10 minutes after but it was on she was professional In all parts of her job. But what I was not expecting was the$119.81 in return for the payment and that enabled me to stay not owing anybody because I was able to pay back my neighbor back the 100 I borrowed from him so like o.o said I have never been late and usually pay two weeks before due date. And for me with three marriageMy credit went south along time ago.and I just didn't try but being 60 now and retirement on the horizon I need a little bit better score and you are keeping your end so am I. But I have nothing to say. Bad about. Covington or the people in your Sulpher Springs branch, The way they react to customers they make you feel comfortable ,even when the store was shut down for a period your people never missed a beat, all I have to say now is if you where a bank I would have an account with your Co.

And after that, you sign the paperwork and they hand you a check of however much you were approved for and that‚Äôs all to it.

Have been doing business with them‚Ä¶,The staff was professional and friendly. The atmosphere was welcoming. The time frame was quick.,5
Love the people that work there.,Sadly after years of being a customer here I will no longer be returning. I first can me to a very welcome and attentive staff that was always on top of things. That was not the case this time around. I was told multiple times that I would receive a call back and had to call myself to see if my loan was approved. The manager was not in the first few times I called to review the status of my loan. Once I was able to reach the manager I was told my loan was denied. Due to new rules and regulations that they now follow. I have been a customer with Covington Credit in Beeville Texas for years and have never had this bad of service before nor was I updated about rules and regulations that they now follow. I receive multiple emails and mail from Covington Credit through out the year. Out of curiosity this would have been helpful to at the minimum know that there was changes made before anyone can do a loan here. It‚Äôs sad to see that this has gone downhill.,5

Great service,"Quick service, knowledgeable of their job, and great attitudes.  Personal loan eligibility was mid hard but passable. Loan rate very high but having a goal to pay off the loan should save customer some of the large finance charges. The monthly payment is a Pro, the amount is Pro however the small amount to borrow is a Con and the interest fee. I think this is going to be a great and fair company in this region.",5

Very helpful and understanding,"Very disheartening to refinance a loan. I signed electronic documents 1/19 and was told funds would be in my account 1/20. No funds!  I called, and instead of the rep saying let me research the issue she immediately assumed and asserted that I entered the incorrect information.  I was told they contacted home office and the funds would be in my account at 5:00 (the same time the office closes). It‚Äôs 5:30pm. No funds!   I guess I need to make adjustments to see if I can cancel this refinance of the contract.  very inconvenient with no sense of customer service and concern from the company.  Typical.",5
They are very convenient for a loan,"I had such a wonderful experience with Covington. The vibe in the office is great. You walk in and theres good jams playing, it's so clean, it smells good and everyone greets you and tells you bye. Mr. Wallace and his ladies were so helpful and kind. Mr. Wallace really helped me in this very bad time I am going through. I cant explain how thankful I am to have received their help.-Whitney",5
I really enjoyed the professional‚Ä¶,"(District manager contacted me after this review apoligized. Say that is not the way they want there customers treated and taking me off the call list and will have talk with Brian) Gave them second chance same crap due date 17 calling job and people on list on the 19th. Never again.2 years agoI have been with Covington credit for of an on for 3 years. I have refered 5 people to them and renewed loans with them on many an as needed bais.Today I got a call at my job one day after my due date this is an unexcepable practice. They pulled me away from my job to ask about payment. 1. I am not allowed to have personal calls at work. 2. One late day is not a reason to call someones job. 3. I dont want everyone at my job or the person answering the phone knowing my buisness. 4. I have done business with many of these types of loan companys and not one even the worst has a policy of calling your job or other people unless you are ignoring them for atleast a week or more. 5. 1 call was made to my personal phone and one message left 2 min before calling my job. I will be closing this account and will recomend all my referals do the same. this new policy is bs and the ""Manager"" Mr Wade was less than apoligitic and says this is how they do business.",5

Something more on the line of power tools , tv's, household junk etc. If that wasn't humiliating enough I was then asked to provide a picture I.D. I assume to prove it was really me along with a current copy of of my bank statement. I assume to show I am not a deadbeat and can repay the loan.

I want you to know the ppl in cleburne‚Ä¶,Today Nov. 9 2020 I received a call from Covington Credit in Greenville Texas. I spoke with Tamisha/Tanisha she mentioned I came due on the 6th. I told her I would have the money until next week she proceeded to lecture me about my payment claiming it was my first payment and I could not be late. I told her there is nothing I can do at this time. She proceeded to talk to me in an aggressive unprofessional tone which caused me to raise my voice in return. She literally asked what I did with my payment that was due on the sixth. I told her she had no right to ask me that and she said she did. I again explained to her I was not aware I was due and I would not have the money for at least a week. She and I got in a heated yelling match about my payment. I really thought I was not due until the 26th. Then she threatened me in a hostile belligerent tone with collection and I then finished the conversation by hanging up saying I am done with this conversation. I will pay it when I get the money. I do not have money growing on trees. I can't just pay whenever I am demanded too. Rest assure I will make my payment but not until around the 20th of this month.,5
