I had been patiently waiting on my turn…,"I had been patiently waiting on my turn and there were 3 people ahead of me.   A lady walked in and was getting a money order.  I was just waiting to pay my bill.  Others were putting in applications which take longer.  She took made the girl take the lady next, which made everyone else have to wait even longer.  She said the money order was not going to take that long,which paying the debt wasn't gonna take long either.  It was not fare because the manager should have asked everyone is it alright if she took the lady next.  We were waiting there a long time the lady could have waited just like we had to wait.",1
Wrong account,Agent at store sent loan to wrong account number. Have to wait for money to get returned to reschedule a lone.,2
I used to say they were good,"I used to say they were good, until recently. I have been trying for over 2 weeks to get a increase on a loan I had been paying in good faith even in hardships, but at one point there was a missed payment, by one day, 2 months ago due to their fault of not automatically drafting it. I paid the next day when ai realize it wasn’t drafted, but they said it takes 6 on time payments to even be considered a increase. My next one was around the corner making it my 6th, I paid it a few days earlier to see if that would help and still no answers, nor help.These guys are not the go to guys for loans anymore, I would say. They’ve had enough time and a early payment should have definitely meant something, but doesn’t in their eyes. Forget Advance America at this point. There are better ones than them. Will never go to Advanced America again!",1

Unfortunately this time getting a loan…,Unfortunately this time getting a loan was difficult. I was approved for a loan on 9/9/22 I put in my debit card number so the money would go on quicker. But as far as today 9/12/22 I still have not received any money. I've made 3 attempt to call and find out what happened. And all 3 times I got a different answer. I'm going to call again tomorrow if it's not in. Because the last lady I spoke to said it will be in today. We'll see,2
I asked for a payment extension because…,"I asked for a payment extension because I changed jobs, and my pay day changed. Was told that it was put in the system, but the payment was drafted from my account anyway, causing my account to be overdrawn. But, I will get the NSF fee refunded.",1
Horrible experience,"Horrible experience! Strong smell of plug in air freshener. Immediately entered my throat. I should have left but didn't think my loan would take so long. Normally doesn't. Kimberly would not get off phone. I kept gasping for air. I kept saying how bad I was feeling but was met with apathy. ""Tasted"" that pungent smell in my throat for the next two hours. I did not know how to counteract this. This experience was definitely detrimental to my physical and mental health.",1
I really enjoy making  business with…,"I really enjoy making  business with ADVANCE AMERICA, but my only concern is why am I being placed a a one week to pay my loan when I used to have a two week period to pay my loan and now it changed?Why?",1
Should have just went into the store,It was very time-consuming I applied for one amount at the beginning and ended up with a lower amount in the end it was not even worth the time or the effort we'll never do it online again couldn't have just went into the store there was no convenience,1
In the last few months i have had such…,"In the last few months i have had such a problem using the online system to get my loan.  It often will not verify my income even though you have all the info and are getting into my checking account.  I have noticed quite a few times when I try it will get to the page that shows my total monthly income of my social security disability but on the same page it shows my 3 month and it is too low so not sure if that has anything to do with it.  This month I must have tried 4 times kept ending up saying to upload documents and I gave up. Plus then stopped at the local office and they were out to lunch and when I came back after they were to be open they still weren't there and there were 4 people waiting outside.  Then a day later all of a sudden the loan was in my account.  Something isn't right.  This was I believe started on 10/1/22 , stopped twice at the office on Monday Oct 3rd but didn't stay after second attempt nor did I have contact with employees. And it appeared in my account on October 4th.",2
They are a joke!,They fail to tell you everything upfront. I gave them the correct paydays when I got my line of credit and they put them in wrong. Then I did what they said paid it off not once but twice to correct my payments and then I called them to correct it and they tell me well you have to close it you can’t just pay it off! They are the worst company I’ve ever dealt with! Will be glad with this is over with and I do not recommend them!,1
I went to the store and paid my bill…,I went to the store and paid my bill and get a new loan. Funny thing is it’s the second time the new loan didn’t show up in my checking account. First time it happened I had to reduce the loan process over this time they state I just have to show up and receive cash which makes me stop by my bank which is out of the way. Nevermind the drive I have to make to the store to pick up cash.,1
THEY ARE A COMPLETE SCAM,THEY ARE A COMPLETE SCAM. They scammed me out of $2600. they would deposit money just to for the bank to send it back a few days later. they said it was a glitch in the system but it kept happening and i never got reimbursed or a loan,1
Terrible experience and run around took…,Terrible experience and run around took out a loan two days later I was told I couldn’t pay it back online but could if I went to store got to store they couldn’t do it and thier solution was to call customer service and wait half hour to be told it can’t be done until after three days holiday weekend so it costs me 4 days interest,1
NOT HAPPY WITH THE SERVICE NOW,"No longer give a good grace period. Not happy about that. They go after to get they money they loan out in less than 2 weeks and they take the money out when I don't have the funds in my bank, putting me more in the minus in my bank when I asked to have a grace period when I get paid. NOT HAPPY WITH THE SERVICE NOW. I think they have lost me as a recurring customer.",1
Repeat customer for a decade-disappointed in the online process,"Repeat customer for nearly 10 years. Instead of going down to store, opted to do it online. E-Signed as instructed. Advance was applied for Thurs., did not approve until Fri afternoon. Funding was not supposed to be affected by the Holiday. Funding has still not commenced but my loan is open.",2
Your online service is lacking,"Your online service is lacking. After several attempts To email, chat to no avail! I requested a change to payment to make the process faster and was told to wait from the 1st to the 9th! There has to be an opportunity here for improvement.",1
Online is awesome,"Online is awesome! When I went to pick up the money, I was not even acknowledged but she acknowledged other customers. Then she grudgingly gave me the cash as if she couldn’t believe I qualified.",2
Very rude,"Very rude. Was on phone asking questions and the head of the department told me to shut up, when he said this I “brought up” reporting them to the better business bureau. The gentleman started yelling saying he was calling the cops/authorities on me….doesn’t seem very official in my opinion. Just be careful with your decision to choose this company.",1
The issue I had was normally  you can…,The issue I had was normally  you can email your bank statement showing the loan was clear. As long as I had the loan I have always done that. I had to wait three days. I didn’t like that at all. It was things I needed to pay. My account was overdrawn. I don’t know if this is something new or what??,2
DOROTHY THE MANAGER DID NOT EXPLAIN THE…,DOROTHY THE MANAGER DID NOT EXPLAIN THE LOAN !!! SHE LEFT OUT THAT WE WILL GET CHARGE $3.65 A DAY TILL LOAN IS PAID UP !!!!

First 2 times I used y'all it was fine…,First 2 times I used y'all it was fine until the next time a double payment was taking out an each time I send what u need it's always something else. Got email the Treasury dept was handling it now an tried to refund me my overpayment y'all deducted an seems to be a problem. U have information u need so I don't understand the problem. If a check up was done at end of day u would see were u double drafted me. Not satisfied at all with what's going on. This has out me in a bind. I would never done last loan if this messup y'all done hadn't of happened,1
Stay on top of your Advance America loan!,"Money should never be paid back until the third of every month, which is when I receive my social security!  But this month, with the holiday, YOU were able to get my money early!  You were paid back on the 2nd of September! Today, on September the 12th, I was finally able to get my new loan into the bank!  This is because I didn't ""ride the website"" with my normal immediate debit card  which allows me to payback my loan and immediately reapply the same day!  It was a nightmare!  Thankfully, my family covered the $255.00, or I would have had checks bouncing all over town!  I was NOT at all a happy camper, and I have been dealing with you for literally YEARS!  You took my money out YOUR WAY and made it impossible for me to immediately reapply the same day!",1
Paid off my loan but couldnt start…,Paid off my loan but couldnt start another loan for over a week?!!  When we had a local office you could show proof the loan was paid and extend it (or start a new one if needed)... now that its online only in our area it takes a week?  That is usless.  Its back to school time and  I needed to get my kids ready for school.,1
As of 11:47,"As of 5:15 p.m., I STILL HAVE NOT received my loan. Not happy at all, especially after being informed I'd have it by 5:00 p.m. today. Now, I'm told I have to wait until 11:00 a.m. tomorrow. I 'd still recommend your service, but this incident leaves much to be desired...considering my loan was approved Friday the 5th by 12:30 p.m.",2
Horrible experience,"Horrible experience. Has to send in my last paystub which I did, then had to wait hours for approval. Was sent notification that my loan was approved and funds would be sent the next day. Never received the funds to my account the next day, or the day after, or the day after that. I online chatted with customer care the day after it was supposed to be sent inquiring what happened, they told me on their end it says it was sent. Three days hater I checked my loan status online and it had been changed from open to void with no zero communication regarding the change or explaining what happened. Still haven’t heard a word. I will never be using this company again.",1

Took two payments,"I was called by a representative who said my payment didn't go through could I come in. I came in this morning to make my payment. They never said the other one DID go through. Went to buy groceries and couldn't. Checked my account and found out that both payments had been taken. They told me nothing they could do,"" it will go on your next payment"". Thanks for nothing Advance America.  When I pay this off I'm taking my business elsewhere.",1
Horrible,"they ask for a lot of information and documents, you must go to the store and apply there because online they can never verify identity, and even in the store the process is horrible, the loans are very expensive in interest and it is with third parties, that is, your information goes Where you won't know, you can't pay online, only in cash and return to the same store, I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT",1
I'd got an email reminding me by…,I'd got an email reminding me by payment would come out on the 1st. My SS check doesn't go to my bank until the 3rd. I contacted AA that the money would not be there until the 3rd. They still took it out on the 1st and cost me an additional fee of $32.00. I'm very disappointed.,1
Hello I recently went to the Allen Park…,Hello I recently went to the Allen Park store and was embarrassed. The lady didn't listen to what I stated and said very loud I had been denied for having 2 or more loans. When she actually entered in my information wrong. So I jad to leave store call 800 number for them to figure out the misunderstanding. Did I forget that I just had surgery a couple days prior and am non weight bearing I was totally inconvenience. I went back and Shaun took great care of me. However I just assume not go back to that lication.,1
During application process,"During application process, I gave my banking info. I received information showing deposits and transfers in my bank account.

The manager was persistent is counting…,"The manager was persistent is counting my advance back to me out loud with other customers waiting near me. I asked him 2x if he, could place the money on the counter slowly as I count it with him, it’s not a safe neighborhood and he refused. I told him, “Yes; you can. Banks, cashiers do it all the time. The cameras can see the both of our mouths are moving counting the money. He just refused”. This experience made me feel nervous, unsafe and disregarded of my concerns expressed. He did not display good customer service. I felt setup to be a possible victim once I stepped out the door. (Elcamino Truxel)Truly disappointed.",1
Incorrect information on websites,"Your website states that if your loan is processed before, 10:30 am l, your funds will be available that day.  That is not the case with you being in the east coast and I'm in the Pacific coast because of the time difference.  Being in the the Pacific coast your loan would have to be processed by 7:30am in order to receive your funds same day.   Huge error and wrong information with your website.",1
Not very helpful,"The person at the store was not very helpful, could not help me find a solution. Persons on the phone dont know anything. I was told three things that end up being the opposite of what they said. They neither could help or find a solution. I had to figure ot out by myself. The website has the wrong information for instant my NAME!!! And I was not able to set up the payment the way I always do!!!! And your interest is WAY TO HIGH. Rhe email I got recently about being so loyal I qualify for the lower interest is a lie. Its highway robbery. You should be ashamed.",2

I got approval pretty quickly but the funds were not deposited quickly and I incurred 2 bounced checks at $70!

My last loan payment Aug 7th 2022,"My last loan payment Aug 7th 2022, was not allowing me to use my credit card, which delayed my payment, which delayed my account status, extending the time of my bank receiving and clearing my payment on time!This delay caused hardship due to 4 additional days before I was allowed to apply for a new loan! Paying by credit card is a more efficient way for a customer to make payments online and on time without delays! The most important aspect of using your loans is not only to access funds for essential purchases, it's most important to reestablish good standing credit status while maintaining a consistent ability to make payments on time would you agree?",1

Bad place to get a loan,Bad place to get a loan. I took a loan out cause I needed to pay something Monday. I got approved rather quickly and easily but then I went to pick up my loan and they had no money. I called the next nearest branch to check if they had money so I can pick up my loan and they refused to tell me. So I drove another 16minutes only to find out they had no money either. I was told I had to cancel my current loan so I could reapply and be able to do online deposit. Problem was that now the money was going to be available Tuesday instead of Monday when I needed it. If taking out a loan as an emergency please do not consider Advance America. They are slow at giving you your money.,1

Your internet app sucks,Your internet app sucks. You ask if your info has changed and we answer NO CHANGES. Then you have to jump through loops to prove that you are the person that has provided you my personal info. Then once it proven then you have to continue providing info. It just isn’t worth the hassle because most of the time you have to go into a store to sign the paperwork or get the money. Since you’ve closed our store in Farmerville LA I have to go 45 miles to get to one of your opened establishments  you finally put the $$$ in my acct this time but just not worth the hassle.,1

It could have been easily resolved you could have got it corrected and loaned me more money meaning you would make more. But the lady at the counter was rude, argumentative, and cost both of us money. I was told to take what she had or get nothing. So I took it which was probably a waste since I needed the amount I was approved for.",1

There are too many other companies I can use, to give my money to someone who employs rude people.",1

4 days later- still can't cash it,"I wrote before- service and process was great. But they didn't have cash on hand the day I got my loan and they gave me a check. I tried from Thursday to Monday to cash that check, Kroger, Walmart, Meijer, my bank... No one would cash that check. Soo called, they said a place downtown (20mi) would cash it for sure but I had to get there while the store I got the check from was open so it could be verified. So, grandkids in tow, I schlepp downtown where they were more than happy to can my check, for a paltry fee of $35.00!!!!!  To cash a 700 check that they just verified. DO NOT ACCEPT A CHECK, ONLY CASH FROM ADVANCE AMERICA.",2
I have been a customer for 5 yes or…,"I have been a customer for 5 yes or more and never had a problem until recently. I always get my check on the 3rd of every month. Last month my payment was due the 2nd. Because I didn't call to change it to the 3rd they went ahead and took it from my account on the 3rd. I always always pay it with my debit card over the phone. If they had called me to remind me of my payment that would of never happened, which by the way they used to do. So because I forgot to call I had to wait till the 5th to get my money again which was quite an inconvenience. I was not a happy camper especially when ever that happened before the girls in the office knew that I would be in to pay the 3rd and the would go ahead and change the date if it failed on the day before.",1

I am upset at what happened to me a few…,I am upset at what happened to me a few days ago. I did my installment loan via phone on the website. I only wanted $350  I got approved for $730 but that was too much. I had a customer service rep on the phone and she couldn't fix it. The interest on $730 will be outrageous. She told me I had to wait 48 hours to return the money. So now I have to drive 20 miles to try to fix this. There should be a way to cancel a loan and reapply. Where if I did that I had to wait 7 to 14 days. That just doesn't seem right. So Monday I am driving down there.,2

You suck majorly🤮,"You suck majorly🤮! I applied for $200 on August 8, 2022. My daughter also applied and gave a referral app to use for mine. I then submitted my documents into the portal on August 8, 2022. I received a notification that said I would receive my money. When the money didn't arrive, I called customer care and they said I would receive the money into my checking account on August 9, 2022. Instead, I never received my money. My daughter received her money on August 10 without her referral incentive. I called again to customer care and was placed on a 29 minute hold before I hung up. They keep saying that the money was sent. However whenever I checked my account, the $200 deposit was not there. Then, Advance America continues to send me ways to pay back the money! That's not going to happen because I never received the money. Called them several times and I still don't have the money. At least give my daughter her $20 that you SAID you would for her referral (me).This company has continued to tell me that they're so sorry about that! I forgive you but I'm not dealing with you anymore! Wish you the best! Deuces!",1

This experience was so bad that I refuse to go to that location which was a half mile from my house and traveled 15 miles to get good service.  I contacted the BBB and left a review on Google  about this terrible experience.  I was contacted by the ""Pissed Consumer"" website about making a video about my treatment and how you guys never responded to this lady's terrible attitude about a complaint about a computer problem.

He was texting me which I thought was weird and kept blowing up my phone for me to send money back and he was trying to rush me so I knew it was a red flag and changed all of my information because I felt he was a scammer his name is Brandon Day please be aware and please be careful he threaten to have my account negative if I didn’t send the money that actually belongs to me to him and legal action against me which I am not worried about because he’s a fraud and scammer,1
No more,Larry & staff are always so Welcoming & great to work w/.,1
I had an bad experience someone was…,"I initially took out a payday loan with this company, which I successfully paid on time. Then the clerk had presented me with a line of credit, which she I could barely hear her, and she kind of sped through the loan. They do all agreements online, which I signed on this tiny device. I went online to check the account which I thought the interest rate was reasonable. I though this was cool and had planned on paying off the loan in two installments. I didn't realize they were charging me an exorbitant interest rate, and the loan amassed $375.45 in interest charges in the first month. Initially, only $25 was shown to have been applied to the principal. I missed the first payment, then I paid towards the second payment. They started generating random checks each month without my knowledge or permission, a few days prior to the due date to ensure that they receive their money on time. I had other bills that I needed to attend to, and their collection practices are predatory. I found out that the state I live in, they weren't supposed to have me as a customer. I'm in another state. I'm glad that I will no longer be using them as a lender, nor will I recommend them to anyone else. When they took my loan into default, I was under the impression that they were to negotiate with me on making a payment arrangement. The loan went into default after one month of being late. If I could give them zero stars, I would. According to the CFPB this type of behavior from a predatory lending institution is not uncommon. Once, I've made arrangements to take care of this bill, I will never do business with this company ever again.",1

I was told that It would be ready to pick up in 3 business days. That was too long. I tried for some time to cancel the unfinished online loan process, but could not find a way to do it. Then I drove to Advance America on West El Camino, and was told they could not give me a payday loan because I already had a loan  ""IN PROCESS"" and I would have to drive home and finish it.    So I did, but was too upset to safely drive back to West El Camino, which is quite a distance away. So I went the next day and it was closed in the middle of the day. So then I drove back today and they said my loan went thru, but they didn't have any cash. . I asked it they could just deposit it in my bank account, but was told that he couldn't do that unless I  called the number he gave me and cancelled the loan. I tried to do that outside in the parking lot, but the Advance America lady on the line told me that "" YES, THEY COULD CANCEL THE LOAN IN PERSON AT EL CAMINO"", so I went back in. They couldn't, or maybe they just didn't know how.  So I ended up driving up and down Stockton Blvd for 45 minutes to find the other store in the heat. I had to call 3 times for direction, but at least they had the cash.    HOW IN THE H--- CAN A PAYDAY ADVANCE PLACE (West El Camino) RUN OUT OF CASH????? IT WAS STILL MORNING!

Great customer service,"Advanced America dropped the ball this time.

Poor service in customer care,The manager of the location has a very bad attitude! The day I walking in to get loan she was sitting outside on the phone and when I walked I said are you open and she said what you need?? I was like damn I don't want to go in there but I proceeded because I needed the cash until that Monday! I sent my husband in to pay the 500.00 back because via my contract it stated that I could pay back loan without the fee and she wanted to charge him the full 587.50 which my husband called me and told him that what my contract says and i told him to her to call somebody! The manager of this location is simply unprofessional and she is not empathic at all. I can honestly see why the location is closing because I promise you I am not the only feels this way!,2
Disappointed,"Pre-pandemic, I used a competitor when I ran into emergency issues. This year I found myself in need of a loan, and applied for a loan not with my former cash advance place, but with Advance America. I was shocked when they only offered me $400 for an installment loan (I make very good money, have a fair credit score, own my own house, etc...). But I needed it that day so I got it. I will be paying the balance off this Friday when I get paid in lieu of the installment process....and next time I'll not use Advance America. Heck, even a payday loan would have netted me $500.",1

Not friendly didt care what happened…,"I am not happy with my recent experience. They have never sent my check to the bank. They know if I can't make it on my due date they know I will be in the next morning. Sometimes my doctor's appointments fall on my due date and I have to wait until the next morning to pay my check. They automatically know this. But since you made changes to how they are suppose to process checks it caused me a bunch of grief. It caused me several trips to my bank and gas that no one can hardly afford today. I am not pleased with your company at all. There are many check writing places in New Albany, Mississippi but people chose yours. But doing this type of stuff to people is a good way to run off business. Your company is the only one who has ever done this to me.",1

Did not deposit the next day like they…,"At the beginning of last month I took a loan out to help with my transplant related expenses.  While I was there a announcement was made that a  computer glitch happened and that only those paying back loans could take out loans.  People were disappointed but understanding.  When I paid my loan back I couldn't take out the usual amount because of the same glitch. I took what I could and left. The same or next day I got a email asking for my opinion on the experience.  I said the ladies were very nice and that they were very professional. I didn't have a bad thing to say about them. I did however tell them my disappointment with not being able to take out my full loan. The next day I recieved a call from whom I assumed was the manager of that location to discuss my review.  Instead of it being a wonderful conversation,  I spent the next several minutes justifying my review. I was told  that  I didn't tell everything and that I was given the option of coming back later when the system was back up.  My thoughts was what if it didn't come back up in time to pay my bills? I didn't understand why I was justifying my review about a computer issue that had nothing to do with the staff. Not once did I say anything negative in 3 years I've used this company.  She then proceeded to tell me the options given to me to compensate me for the inconvenience of not getting my full loan. I chose one and updated me review.  In my updated review I praised her and the company.  20 minutes after I hung up from her, I got another call from her stating that my information was outdated and i needed to bring in updated information.  I get SSDI  and always give the the paperwork once a year.  I took in my paycheck stubs just a few months ago so that I can get approved for a larger amount.  I'm  wondering why after 3 years of never ever receiving a call from this company, that I get two in one day. Why is it that my account is getting this much attention when all I did was give a review saying the computer system glitch made it impossible to get a full loan? No one should ever be treated this way because of a review that had nothing to do with any employee. No one should ever have to justify their opinion.  This by far is one of the worst experiences I've had with a company that I had a good relationship with.  As the day drew closer to pay my loan back, I had anxiety about having a confrontation with this lady or having the staff treat or look at me in a different fashion.  So I decided that I'll pay back my loan via over the phone and discontinue my relationship with this company.  The company gave  me some nice choices to choose from. Me passing up those options should speak volumes on how I felt after the experiences with this employee.  Let me say again,  this was a computer issue so why did she speak to me like I totally trashed her and the staff in my review. All this over a computer glitch.  I have done many reviews on many platforms.  My reviews have well over a million hits. I get that many hits because I don't need to lie or make up things. If I do make a mistake I own it. If this is the way you treat people who patronize your business,  then this is not the company I want to deal with. Its a shame because my fiance and I both just had transplants 6 months apart and we live 2 minutes away from this location.  I dont want anything else to do with this lady so please do not have her call me ever again. All of the staff I really like and its a shame I have to   end business dealings with them.",1

As a customer I have a right to make a decision on wearing face mask on my own, if the manager wants to wear one, fine.

I get paid on the 30th and 15th. My last loan was withdrawn on 3/28. WTH!...this caused an overdraft in my account. I will have to tell people not to use them. I will postmy bad experience In all social media.,1

Sure they help you with money you need fast but believe me it's not worth it. I got an email saying I can refinance it. What a joke. That's so my payments start all over and are higher.

To say the least the representative acted as if she didn't want to wait on me. The store had a be back at 3:00pm sign on the door and I arrived at 3:10pm the representative told. E she was still on break but would assist me. I should have left at that point, but gave it a try. The representative made it a point to me that all their customers get checks we don't keep cash. Not friendly at all. I should have known because it has been my experience that mostly all the people in the Winnsboro area are rude and unprofessional. I will Not go back to that location again. The two at the Two Notch Road location are very friendly from the time they unlock the door until they finish your transaction. Winnsboro has a bad representation for visitors and customer service.

The Center I used was shut down without any warning. It allowed me to pay in the office but told me I would have to go to another office to reborrow.. This recent transactionI called and explained I had tested positive for COVID19 and if it was possible to complete the transaction over the phone including reborrow of the funds. I was told that I could. After the money was paid. I asked what did I need to do to reborrow. I was told i/could not be done. I explained that I was told I could. They explained that it could not be done. I said excuse me I asked you that before the transaction and you said I could.  They told me sorry for inconvenience let me transfer to customer support. I explained what happened and they said we don't do that. But I was told that initially and would have tried to make other arrangements.  I was told to go online and apply. Going online takes away from me being able to pay my bills as I have in the past. I feel thatI was misinformed and taken advantage of due to being in a situation beyond my control with COVID19.  As I stated I have used these services for several years even paid it out and in the process of doing it again. I explained before paying  I needed to pay AND reborrow. I was told ok. Then after paying told I could not. That's false information and I don't want to have the funds taken from my account. I would rather do as I have been down. I pay on time.,2

Terrible,"I applied Thursday early afternoon. No one reached out or asked for anything. Come the next day, I reached out and asked if there was anything else I needed to do (again, had not and still haven’t received what was needed). I was informed an ID was needed. So I put that in. Later that day around 4:45 - 5 - I logged back in and it said it was approved! Awesome! It may take a little time. Then it tells me it won’t be available until the next business day (and weekends aren’t business days). After that, the site updates to tell me due to Mondays holiday, they won’t come through that day either. So now I will (maybe) be receiving the money into my account literally three days before I’m supposed to pay it back. How is that ok? Why was I not informed BEFORE hand? The site said nothing about that until after 5 on Friday. I can’t talk to anyone about it because you guys were closed all weekend apparently. I’d already  applied and was approved so I couldn’t go somewhere else, which forced me to have to wait, in silence, to hopefully be able to call on the 18th and explain the situation. I’ll be honest, I was super relieved at first when it went through, then I found out all the other information and it instantly made me feel far worse. My opportunities were taken and I feel like the company took complete advantage of me in my time of need. I’m seriously upset about this. I didn’t need the money on Tuesday, on Monday, noR Sunday. I needed it Thursday or Friday, Saturday at the latest. Not a whole week later. At this point, it’s going to cost me even more money to borrow this money, AND I still got hit with late fees. Literally, this whole process and the lack of transparency has cost me about $150 in fees, not including the fee for this. I’m in a worse spot than I was. I really do feel like this was done predatorily. I’m not the only one who experienced this, and it makes me think it was done purposefully. The lack of communication, the fact I had to reach out to find out what else was needed, the fact the site said nothing about the 17th until after the fact, etc. I’m not trying to be rude, but this has caused a lot of problems when it should have been helping to solve them.",1

Unfortunately, he did not manually change the date and the loan went through a day before my payday causing my account to go negative.

I was in Winnsboro,"Bait and switch.  I had completed all of the paperwork needed to obtain a loan and then was told this location was closing so I would have to deal with either Des Moines or Marshalltown for payment of the loan.  I received no cash only a check.  I have no idea what was wrong with the printer but I folded the check and placed it in my billfold.  Upon arrival at the bank the ink was so smeared and illegible that the bank would not accept the check.  Upon return to the store I was told there was nothing that could be done until Monday.  On Monday I was informed that we had to wait 24 hours for the cancelation on the check. Staff should have informed me the location was closing before processing any loan information/paperwork to ensure I wanted to proceed.  The check printed and issued to me should not have and issue with smearing or rubbing off, like it did.  I should not have to had to wait 4 days to ensure the transaction had been cancelled and all business issues resolved.  This was by far the worse action I have encountered with payday loans in the last 20years of my life.  I can see why the location is closing!!",1

I am very upset about how I was treated. I got approved for a one thousand dollars and she did everything not to give me the money going as far as to cancel my loan.

I’m borrowing $500 every 2 weeks and paying $88 in interest which equals $166 a month, if I can successfully maintain paying that, I should be able to have a long term loan. You loan companies are loan shark gangsters. I’m about to find other options and plan to never use your service any longer but I’m sure that won’t affect your company because y’all will take advantage of many others in a bind to make your harsh interest charges.  Y’all really act like you’re helping people but really just gangsters are given permission from our also gangster government.

Living on Social Security I really couldn't afford to lose this kind of money. Once I gave up they told me I wouldn't be reimbursed for my expenses of $1100 because I didn't receive the loan. I should mention that one of the reasons I had to purchase so many cards was after purchasing and sending the cards through both email or text message I was told the card was invalid. I checked the value of the last card I sent and 2 hours after Advance America confirmed they received the card, there were 3 transactions made (for $99.98 each) for one specific merchant. The card then had a value of $.06. Out of 6 cards I purchased either online or in store, only 2 of them were good according to Advance America.

The customer service what’s always been friendly but not having specified times to be closed to lunch is very frustrating. I shouldn’t have to make multiple trips because the times that it’s closed is never consistent.

One of the questions in the beginning of the process was if I use bitcoin. I said no, and asked why they ask that, and they would not respond to that. Then later I asked if they are a company that sells bitcoin, they stated no, but would not work with me any other way. Complete waste of time, and not good customer service at all. I spoke with Jason Green, Sr. Loan Analyst who just kept saying ok, ok, ok, ok.... I would not recommend this company to a person even if they were a last resort.

Terrible place,"Chat rep kept disconnecting without answering my question, and when I called customer service they said they couldn’t help me. Have to do it online. Useless.",1
Difficult for difficultly sake.,It’s the worst experience I will never recommend you. I was approved Friday before 1030 deadline eastern time was told by 2 different representative I would get my funds by end of the day. I never received called Saturday was told by 3rd person will not be available till Monday. Then to top it off I’m suppose to pay back that same week worst service I received. I needed those funds on weekend what good do I need it now.,2
WEBSITE DOESNT WORK,Wanted to pay off my payday loan but was told I had to wait 10 days to pay it off! Don’t understand why I have to wait! No other payday company does that. It’s a ridiculous policy! The payday loan is due on the 23rd which is less than 10 days! I want to pay it now but now I have to wait. Frustrating!,1
My first time applying for a loan…,"As if  you do not charge enough already, you went up on your fees. A great time to break the habit .",2
Never do an online loan through Advance America,I have put out many complaints about the Alexander city branch yet I still find that the head manager there is still working. It is against the law to discuss people's loans outside of the BUISNESS but yet it's still being done. That's ok I will sue the entire company and by then maybe y'all will know how to do your jobs right.,2
When i call to get help im on hold for…,Did not work to get more time to pay than the weekly payback too early to pay back the loan!,1
I thought was ok but they will tell you…,I kept trying to call the customer service number and it kept me on hold way longer than it kept saying,1
Really dissatisfied,"I would say that your service at this time  at Advance America is absolutely amazing. Customers are treated with the utmost respect from  the time they enter until they leave this place of business with a warm gracious,professional smile.",1
Recieved notice o was approved and…,I tried to call corporate I have something I need to  fix on my loan and cannot fix it. I never received it and they told me to call corporate. On hold for 2 days and also joined callback list. Nothing,1
The woman  that did my loan had attitude,"Yes, there’s been a couple of mistakes and problems that we’re not exactly handled the best. The first problem was I called the customer assistance number to get onto a government payment plan for my online loan. After being on hold for 51 MINUTES  I was finally disconnected. And this is since I gave up and just really long which cost me a extra $30-$40. Next, was a mistake made by a customer assistance operator. I called in to once again get on a payment plan (I couldn’t make it to the store) this time for my in-store loan.  I had just taken out an online loan about 2 to 3 hours earlier. I talk to the customer care assistant and they said they could put it on a payment plan no problem. Come to find out they put the loan I just taken out three hours ago on a payment plan and my other loan was still due. So fast forward two weeks later and I’m in the store to pay back and re-loan and I’m told that I’m not eligible. I called customer care and was told I had to clear it up with a agency in Michigan. I called the agency up and they said they have no way of taking me off a payment plan and I need to call back to advance America. I was able to get on with a different customer care specialist and they were able to solve the problem. Unfortunately, this took me over an hour to get cleared up. So you might ask why after all these problems didn’t i file complaint before. I understand in these times businesses are having trouble running as efficiently as they would like. But you did send me an email asking for my feedback, so I’m providing it. I hope that not only for your business but for all the other businesses that are struggling things get better.",2
Associate very RUDE,I wanted to cancel my loan before it funded.  First I tried holding for over an hour and no one ever answers.  Then I tried requesting the call back.  No one ever calls you back.  Then I tried chatting.  No representative was available.  Then I tried emailing.  No one has answered me yet.  I logged in after the funding came through hoping to pay off the loan.  Guess what?  No option to make payments online.  All around awful AWFUL non-existent customer service.,1
Excellent service,I've done business with the office on Rainbow for years. I've never late with a payment. Because I questioned getting a courtesy call my customer experience was the worst I have EVER had. Once this loan is paid I will have to find another service to use.,2
Paid on time online and still unable to…,It was so easy to make a payment but getting a loan was a nightmare. Took 4 days I believe.,1
Worst experience ever,"No money, gave us checks, our bank was going to hold for 10 days, sent us to two of their banks (Bancorp South), which would not cash them, had to go to Dodge’s store to get cashed, which cost us $30.00.  Your employee sent us to both banks and then told us we would have to go to Walmart or Dodge’s where they cash checks to get them cashed.  We even asked her if she could give us cash the next day and she said probably not.  We needed this money and we are on a limited budget and cannot afford to be paying out extra money to cash these checks.  We are great customers but may not be using you again.",1
"If you're in a pinch, they're here. Massive interest rates, but they *are* here.",I called Customer Service over an hour ago regarding my upcoming payment and I am still on hold. The recording started with a wait time of 12 minutes and has been incrementing ever since to 20 minutes. Yet I continue to wait. I have experienced long wait times before but never like this.,2
Big Mistake,The people are rude and customer service is very rude after I pay off this loan I will never use advance America again and I will tell all my friends never to use advance America at all,2
Didn't help me out at all wasted time…,"Ive given 5 star reviews before to advance America, but this time I don’t think I’ll be going back. I used the new online option to request a payday loan. All went well, all information verified, and all contracts signed money is ready for pick up within the hour! Great! No. I get to the store, go up, tell her I did the online loan and got an email to come pick up the cash or check. The lady looks at me and says “what, what online thing? I’ve never heard of this, oh great just what I wanted to do on a Friday morning. Hold on let me call my boss because I don’t know how to do this stuff. Give me your I’d” I give her my ID and copy of the email and loan number from online. After waiting about 10 minutes she says she finds it. Hangs up with her boss, and then says she doesn’t have an option to give cash. So I say ok, a check is fine like I do every other time. She says well then I need your bank information. I said uh ok.. it’s in system? I come here a lot, and I verified it online last night with the loan app. She says “well I still need verification” so I give her my account and routing number. “Well it says it doesn’t work, and it’s not letting me click on verify”. This is now going on being in the store for 35 minutes.  She then tells me that she’s going to have to cancel and do everything over again manually so I need to print out all my documents I had submitted online and bring them to the store. I said forget it. I had to get going, and tried using the online tool because of “how much faster and convenient” it was to do online. She says, “ well why’d I just waste all that time trying to get it to work!” I just smiled and politely said so much for that being a faster process. And walked out. The online tool says that if you do not pick up your money by closing time 2 days after you sign the documents then your loan will be cancelled. Well 3 days later I get an email reminding me of my payback date for the money I never received! Now, no one can explain to me what happened and I still show an open account. The only reason I gave two stars instead of 1 is because I like the idea of Advance America in general and had never had a bad experience until now. But it made enough of an impact for me to not want to go back.",1

She told me that the “online department” is totally different from in store and they do not have access to see what is online and vice versa. This caused her to have to fill out a hand written form and me to have to pull up all of the information on my phone while in store. The hand written form was then uploaded online. Just not sure why the option is there to help with convenience, but then not recognized in store. Especially with COVID, passing my phone back and forth was not an ideal situation.",1
Honest opinion,Unhelpful and quite frankly disappointing,2
"I received a late notice ,paid 9/3",I've been using my local store for years and never had a problem until now. My payday advance was processed using my bank debit card to deposit funds in my bank account. I went out to my car and while still in their parking lot tried to make an online debit card purchase but funds were not yet available. No problem I went to bank to pull funds from ATM. The next day I saw bank charged NSF fee. Funds from Advance America were never deposited. I called the local store 2x's but reached corporate without reporting. Later that day I talked to local store was asked to come in. The lady that processed my advance wasn't there. I was told my transaction was processed as cash and given the transaction amount in cash. I said my debit card was swiped for the transaction and I need the $35 NSF fee refunded. She reiterated it was processed as cash and no refund made. I didn't get an apology either. I'm on SS and I need the $35 refunded AND AN APOLOGY.,2
I wanted to cancel my loan before it…,10 yrs of on time payments and new management thinks taking two extra days to get monies by seizing it from bank one day early are somehow beneficial to company ! Promise it are not and will be proven to be incorrect time after time !,1

I had no choice but to get the debit card and I did not get to use the full $445 because of their fricking fees! This was wrong Advance America! You owe some type of refund on the fees I had to pay to use the dsmn debit card!",1

Slow on responding,This company doesn’t care about the customer. I had a loan due August 4th. I paid it off June 30th. Renewed my loan and I got confirmation that it was accepted and my loan was due to be paid on 8/15/21. August 4th they deduct my account. I’m overdrawn because of there mistake and they won’t help. Th excuse is the system I set up that way but if we were late the system would work fine. This company is horrible and I won’t recommend it to anyone. Then I get a response that someone will contact me back and no call. Just like I said a horrible company. Do not use this lender.,1

So the customer had to come back when she realized the receipt was not in her name. So your employee had to do a hand written receipt for her & then couldn't figure out how to take that payment off my paid account so after 2 hours I had to leave with a Payday Loan!! This lady was very unprofessional and basically said there was nothing she could do until the computer fixed her mistake!!",1

After the lady did my application she opened her drawer to get my money and said that she was short of cash but she could do a deposit directly to my account. I said no I need the money right now I think the bank will hold The check for 10 days before depositing it.  The lady said no it’s a direct posit it will be there in five minutes. I said ok but it Hass to go in in five minutes because I have to have the money today. When I went to the bank there had been no deposit I went the second time to the bank there was still no deposit I went back to Advance America and the lady told me that yes it has been deposited I told her I had just come from the bank and there was no money in my account. She told me she couldn’t help me I ask for a phone number for someone that could help me she told me she could not give me that phone number because it was a cell phone. It’s now August 2 and there are still no deposit in my account. I think this is so wrong and I think it should be illegal for your employee to tell me it would be there in five minutes and when it did not go she still couldn’t help me. I have done business here before but this is been the biggest nightmare ever!! It just shows me that advance America does not care anything about a client.  I think this direct deposit is fraud and now I’m in a worse shape than I was in when I went to get the check advance in the beginning. Word of mouth is the best advertisement but it’s also the worst advertisement for a business! I will never ever go back to advance America and anybody that asked me I will tell them the same thing.",1

Very good service always helpful,"A week ago , I email you and asked you to block me from your system that I have a gambling problem . It seems to me you don't care as long as you keep making $ 45.00 almost every week.  You even made it easier for me to obtain a loan even during non bussiness hrs. I have currently 4 payday loans pending and I am going to need more time to repay this loan. I know that ultimately it is my responsability and I will pay you. But if I asked you for help, why did you ignore it ? Once I am in a casino I have no control and I will do whatever it takes to get money. I ask for the second time , d I not lend me money anymore. I am getting help for my problem , please do not contribute to my problem. If speedy cash did it so can you. Thabk you.",2
not enough cash,"I have had great response and respect for your company before.I have had several loans and had paid back no problem.after I moved from Wyoming to Dallas i needed a loan again after severalyears I up dated information as requested and after talking with the rep they said yes you have done everything needed so I applied for the loan again and i asked whets the loan amount i can expect to get she told me $1,800.ok great thank you update my information. only to find out i can only get $700.00the next day MORE INFORMATION NEEDED, I again spoke with someone and told me i was good  okay so I fill out that.next day MORE INFORMATION NEEDED.so iI complete all of that and was supposed to be good to go.then the day i was supposed to get the loan computers go down and I can't get the loan until Wednesday ! well my bank was supposed to get the funds I needed to avoid some service charges and bam i get those services charges hit me at the tune of $240.00 well the 700.00 dollar loan was gone in a flash due to fees and didn't cover what It was  supposed to.my fault for not attending to my own checking account but i wasn't expecting a hit from a company that took money from my account, thus the reason I needed your services.  your company should have been more informative and honest about what was needed in the beginning and  should have been more attentive to the paper work needed in the beginning. not happy with the end result at all but this will probably fall on deaf ears anyway.i do appreciate the loan but not the run around and Inefficiencies that the way this was handled.",2

Love the ease of use,When their system messes up your payment it is considered your fault. Customer service through the phone is useless and extremely unprofessional.

They ACH my payment and it took over a week for my loan to clear, even though the money came out of my bank account immediately, I could not re-loan. All of my money was then tied up. The absolute worst customer service when I called to try and fix it.",1
This was the baddest I've ever dealt…,$300 is not enough money at 34% and is not worth my time.  I would definitely not recommend borrowing such a small amount only to end up paying back twice the amount that you borrowed.  Save up an emergency fund and make a budget.  Peace.,1
Awful website that won’t allow you to log on.,You guys perform well during customer service,1
Everything went very smoothly,Very poor online and in store service.   Also I don't have time to sit on hold for another 2hrs last time I called the 1800 number.. I'll tell the storey here..I applied for a at 4am didn't hear anything by 8am so I sent few emails to customer service asking how I would know if I needed to do anything else so it would be processed same day to my bank. So after numerous emails and live chat no response til after the cut off for same day processing. They informed me that only was to get it same day was in-store so I canceled my online application and when to store (20 miles away) Upon arrival 2 employees was standing by door smoking no biggie. I explain to ladies assisting me as soon as they greeted me that i just canceled my online loan because i couldn't get money same day and neither one said a word...so i do my application everything goes fine until they ask how I want my money lol I'm like cash haha they are like sorry we only have $20 in our drawer but we can give you a prepaid card haha so needless to say I canceled that loan also 😅,2

Unhelpful and quite frankly…,"on July 3rd I came in for a loan. She set it up and  at the end I asked what dayit was to be payed on. she said 29th of each month. I am on a fixed income and I came in on the 3rd to make sure it would be taken out on this day. After all paperwork was done then she told me it would be taken out then.. You can bet I will not being doing loans with you again. I was told if I had a problem with it take it up with office and she then gave me a number and toke it up with them. If it is taken out of my account before 3rd it will cost me $45, over draft fee. Thank you.",1

I was promised a call back from a…,"Trying to get a loan online here was a nightmare.   I did everything right but still didn't get the loan even though I was qualified to do so.   I ended up calling them to see what was wrong and the woman was very nice, however, told me that I not only had to send in my bank statement and ID photo but also photos of the back of the ID plus a photo of me holding the ID.   These steps were not listed in the instructions and I didn't find out about them until I called.   I went to the store itself and got the loan within minutes instead of waiting for a week.   I will only go to the store and never online again.    I gave one star for this website but 5+ for the lady at the store.",1
Review,"I went online 07/01/21 and paid my loan out,and when I tried to borrow $350 again,Your system locked up on me.I waited an hour hoping it would free up.I had to go to local store to get my loan done.It was very disappointing to me that  ya’ll didn’t have your system ready to go.So I can’t give you a five star.Your online system didn’t work for me,but it took my $405.00 without any problem at all😩😩😩",2
This company doesn’t care about the customer,"The process is normally simple and very easy but on the day I went to the Nelson Road store in Lake Charles,La the young lady had a very very very very very very nasty attitude.I asked her are you having a bad day maam, and she said YES .Well young lady its not my fault, so please don’t take this nasty attitude out on me.You think I want this title loan ??? NO but I need it, just like you need people like myself business !!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
Taking money without permission.,"I have been utilizing the Advance America for the last couple of years.  I have seen some serious changes that are affecting customer service.  The first being that this facility has a problem having money to give to their customers.   They either refer them to another Advance America, or say that they can deposit to their debit card.  The second item is that my debit card is PNC that is utilized for my UMB account through Fidelity investments.  I had no problem paying my payments with my debit card through the !-800 number.  Now  Advance America can not take my payments from me using this PNC debit card.  I have to travel there to make my payments, where as before I called the 1-800 number and made the payment.  Also Advance America can not even deposit funds onto my PNC card.  Becoming a major inconvenience.  Third, I had to delay my payments because of a medical situation.  I called the corporate office and they extended my payment date.  However the branch processed my payment on the initial date, which caused a serious issue with me because I was unable to obtain heart medication because of the action of the branch.  When I questioned about it they said the corporate office could not do the extension only the branch.  When I contacted the corporate office they refuted that and said they have authorization to do such an extension of a payment date.  It seams like the branch and the corporate office are not on the same page.  I did this once before about a year ago and had no issues have it was authorized by the corporate office.   Something has changed and it is not in the best interest of the customer.  Lastly, I am unable to get a loan online, because I am unable to have the deposits made into my bank, do to Advance America not allowing a PNC debit card to be utilized.",2

Ive been going to this location for years and never experienced this type of service. The lady helping me actually stole $100 from me and did it while the cameras were on. She claimed I only gave her $200 which was false because all I had was $300 in my wallet. She pulled this, you only gave me $200 when I clearly gave her $300. She acted as if something fell over her counter which was the $100 she said I was short. This happened this past 25th of June around 11 am or so with only 1 employee working at the time. Worst experience I’ve ever had at this location.",1

Your refer a friend program is a joke,I have into your store's for a payday loan no issues very professional. This last time I did it on line and I was given a shorter time to pay back my loan. So now I have to go a competitor of yours to get a loan to pay you back.,1
Problem Gambler,"I love using advance,  been with them over years. However, with the online customer service help, they need to allow authorization from 3rd parties.

When I got to the store she said I owed $200 back. I was very upset because I did not have an extra $100. I had already set aside the money for my bills.  After much debate I took a hundred dollars from my bills just to end the argument.  I am now behind on a bill because of this.

In Oak Park, she has the same attitude. Everyone has bad days. But, this is her norm. Highly unsatisfied with the personal skills of the cashier representative.",2
I find the service acceptable,"I originally started my account with the Haleyville office and was extremely happy with the courtesy ,professionalism, and knowledge of the staff. This office was recently closed down so i had to switch over to another office an hour away from where i live. I have had nothing but one problem after another with the staff at the new office. They are not professional, knowledgeable ,or courteous. I almost lost my vehicle over 0.90 cents due to an error on their part and they never did make it right, so i borrowed $700 from someone and immediately paid off the title loan account. Sadly, i am still in debt for a payday loan. I drove the hour it takes me to get to the office and there was about 10 customers ahead of me. This was on the 3rd of the month when people who receive social security disability get paid. The person who came with me has an account there also and is also disabled and awaiting surgery. We were in severe pain and there were not enough chairs and he had to sit in the floor. When we finally got to our turn, the manager apologized for the wait and i remarked that there are usually 2 staff members in the office to wait on customers and she replied that she had alot of customers earlier and then it got a little slow so she sent that employee to another office to help them. The 1st and 3rd of every month is going to be very busy because this is when people with disabilities get paid and every Advance America office should have at least 2 employees working all day on these 2 days every month. As i stated, these are disabled people who have alot of physical problems and pain already and are not able to endure these long wait times. You have to come in person to renew a payday loan. The staff did recently mention implementing a way to make payments and renew loans straight from a bank account but this method is how i almost got my only vehicle repossessed by Advance America over 0.90 cents so i am too afraid to do it that way. Hopefully, all Americans are about to receive another stimulus check and i am going to use mine to pay off my loan with Advance America and pray i never have to go back again. The person who accompanied me who had to sit in the floor and whose blood sugar dropped too low because he had to wait so long and not have food, is also going to pay his loan off. We have been very good customers for a very long time and your company has made alot if money off of us and would have made alot more, but what started out as a great experience at the Haleyville,Alabama office, turned into a very dreadful experience at the Hamilton,Alabama office.",2

Having never had a pre-paid card. I ask if it was like a debit card. They said yes. Well, Netspend card charges the individual who possesses it. A 2 dollar fee for spending their own money. So needless to say. Mine doesn't exist anymore. But, not before they got me for upwards of $20.00. If anyone reads this and still purchases a pre-paid card. You're a fool. An idiot! They charge you a fee to spend your money. That's extortion should and I do it. Screw the Dixie Hgwy store.",1

I called the office in Lancaster, and I was informed that they could not extend funds to me because I paid my bill online.  This is very confusing.  I called your office, and the woman who spoke to me was very nasty in informing me that I had been informed as to the policy change which did not allow me to withdraw online right after I paid online. She even went so far as to state that this new change was in my paperwork.  When I asked her where this was cited, she started reading something that had nothing to do with the so-called new policy; and she was as nasty as sin!!!!!  I ended up driving 20 miles again to go into the store for clarification, and I was informed that if I had paid my bill in the store, I was able to do another loan at the same time, and that they were very sorry for the problem.  So, I'm not happy about this at all.  What you advertised as a convenience did not turn out to be a convenience, even though I've been a good customer for a long time.  I don't get it.

I was told that my old card would not be processed and to make the payment on my due date with my new card manually. I paid the loan in full and on time but as I tried to apply for a new loan I was denied 3 times only to find out that they still tried to process the payment on the disabled card anyway after I emailed and called a head time to let them know not too. I wanted to get a new loan to keep from getting behind at least until my bank credits my money back in my acct that was stolen from me.,2

Deputing 1st payment!!!!!,"You are quick to withdraw my payment due, but take what seems near an eternity to close ny payday loan! I cant believe it takes that long to clear, when the transaction clears that very same withdrawl date. I will look for someone faster,  on my next payday loan.",1
Interests rates are too high!!,How could you take advantage of the people in need. 300% charge ? That is outrageous!Some people can never get out of the cycle of abuse you are doing.You should be ashamed for taking advantage of the pandemic!,1
Yaw suck!!!,My recent payday advance took 5 business days to clear. Previously I have been able to re-borrow the same exact day I pay my balance.,1
I have been a loyal customer,Have not received my loan and its been more them 2 days and everything they said is the opposite,1
The two females they were working there…,Your manager at this facility need some people skills training. She did not smile once and made me feel as an undesirable for the need to borrow money. If she had personal problems she should keep out of work. I think I’ll go to another store if I have the need again.,1
They have a easy system to use,"My Service Representative was extremely honest...it was the end of my work day - I had to rush getting there,  several ATM machines were down, I finally got the money I needed. Once getting to the store location I had totally forgotten I took out extra funds, so I handed over $800+, and she was extremely honest, made me aware of my error and returned the extra funds. In addition she was thorough, patience and friendly.",1
I spoke with Daisy from Corporate,I went to advance America in Anderson at 10 am no one was there and didn’t show up until 11 I went to the one in Redding and got my payment done I won’t be back to Anderson anymore,1
My payback date keeps getting changed,I have been with you guys for years and never had a problem until this last time I took out a loan.Yoy guys held for 5 days cause me late fees on my other bills. I always use my debit card to make my payment and receive my money . However this last time they said I used a check and held it for 5 days which meant I couldn't take out another loan until today but my bills are due last Friday.Nit very happy at all😞,2
The interest rate way too high had i…,"I applied on the 15th and didn't get my money til the 19th.  I realize there was a holiday, but come on this was rediculous and then on top of that you want me to pay back the money on the 27th.  One week later pay it back.  I get paid once a month, so I have one question for you.  If I was to get another loan on the 1st, and don't get paid til the 24th of February will the money be due on the 24th?  I never had this problem before at the Huntington Beach store.  They always made it due to pay back the 4th Wednesday of the month when I get paid.  I hope I wasn't too hard on you, but it sure was aggravating to get my money.Thank you for listening even if nothing will be done,  Cheri",1
Horay,I needed cash immediately and it was sent to my debit bank card instantly. I also got 25 dollars for referring a new client. Thankyou,2
I am very angry with my last…,"The ladies at the Lancaster Advance America Office have been very helpful, friendly, and very professional over the many years I've done business with Advance America.  They assist me and grant me an extra 2 days for payment every month because I receive Social Security checks on the 3rd of every month, and they understand this.  However, I can't say the same for the online assistance, where I informed them up front that I could not make the recent payment until the 3rd of January (while receiving a bunch of e-mail reminders that my payment was due at the end of December)   Yet, when my Social Security check arrived early to my surprise, they immediately ignored my request and immediately took the funds out of my account on December 31, 2020.  Apparently, my request was ignored even though I've paid in full what I owe consistently and on-time by the 3rd of every month.  Consequently, I do not plan to utilize Advance America anymore.",1
The new personal in Apopka not to…,Excellent service very polite.Was .great explaining everything .,2
Fraudulent,"Never deposited after approved. Also, never responded to my email.",1

I still do not have the money I really need on the 26th, and now it won't be available until the 28th at the earliest. Then, payment is due already on the 31st?? I have been a long term customer with all loans paid in full. Also, I have had the instant deposit to my debit card in the past. Now all of a sudden I was told it was not an option? I really hope to hear from some one there to discuss what has happened, and maybe even change the payment date at least??? We will see.....",2
They didn't put my money on my atm…,"I am very upset with how long Advance America corporate is taking to return my money back to my card that I over paid them in the amount of $200 because they still processed my check after I paid in person. This time of the year is already stressful and I already had to make my pennies stretch so the fact that it’s been over a week and the money is still not back in my account is very disappointing and has caused my holidays to be very stressful not to mention they closed my account and won’t allow me to take out another loan because of my returned payment which their claiming is fraud but that’s not accurate at all  , so I has to pay $600 all at once and then they took another $200 out my account still ...The fact that I can’t use their services any longer is probably a blessing in disguise because they really screwed up my account & this should’ve been resolved ,  especially with how advance technology is. It definitely made me never want to take out another pay day advance ever again in life.",2

Cashier Representative,I am not satisfied with the amount. I have done Business with you for quite some time when you were doing payday loans I was doing the maximum of 500 now a personal loan with you you’re only allowing 260 it makes no sense I have paid you on time every time and don’t intend to change thank you,1

I would like to know why,"I arrived @ 1:30 pm Friday afternoon 12/18/20, when store opened after lunch break. 6 customers waiting for store to open. I was #4 of 6 in line. To my unbelief only 1 store associate on duty. Cheyenne was only store associate working with 6 people in line for help & the phone ringing off the hook. What Poor Management to only schedule 1 store associate on Friday afternoon. The wait time was 18 minutes for me to finally get helped.Cheyenne did a wonderful job with all the stress of customers looking at her & phone  ringing off the hook.I suggest the Store Manager gets written up for this very poor scheduling. I feel bad for Cheyenne having to go so much stress, but she handled it like a champ. I believe Cheyenne should be the Manager & demote current manager for customers having to wait so long on Friday Afternoon, probably the busiest day of the week.Very unhappy with poor management decisions to not schedule properly & make customers & numerous phone calls to waite while Store Manager isn't even @ work to help on busiest day of week!!!!!",1
Excellent customer service but…,"It's Saturday at 3:09pm and I still don't have my loan deposited into my account seems like I have to wait until Monday which I requested my loan on Thursday night.

Since our local store closed everything…,I’ve tried so many times to pay online and every time it won’t bring up my account it keeps saying that it’s not right and it is,1
Payday not correct,The process was not clearly explained at all steps by all involved. The website is not easily understood. In the end I think it would have been faster and easier to go in person than to complete it online. Additionally my due date is before my next scheduled pay date which I provided so its confusing how you can expect a payment before I get paid on a payday loan. I emailed customer service and have not received a true response as all I have received is the form do not reply that originates when you submit a question.  Look at their blanket reply to my review. Ridiculous I still have not heard from anyone regarding this.,1
If I could give you a zero I would,"Filled out application, apparently got approved but never got any funds, and no contact from the business!",1
Payday Loans,Everything was nice and easy until it was time to give the cash . I was approved for $700 The store only had $200 cash and gave me a check for $500 unfortunately went to cash the check and it would take 3 days to clear my account. Ended up having to pay $50 to cash the check . Not satisfied at all won’t be a repeat costumer. If loans are your business might try having the cash to give the costumer. $50 is to much to have to pay to get your check cashed,1
I regret using the store in PRP…,Her attitude is always awful can tell she don’t like her job,2
Ridiculous Interest Rate,Excellent service and friendly employee. Gets it done wuickly and efficiently.,2

Outrageous!,"They got rid of credit/debit card deposits, the deposit to account option just isn't quick enough. Bring it back please.

Excellent  Service,"Ok, I appreciate the new system, and doing things on line. But I went to do a loan on line , and it worked fine, and I re loaned and the money was in my account by 4:45 pm . All good . When the loan was due the next time it was taken out of my account automatically, still no problem, it cleared my bank, but when I got off work the advance American said I couldn’t Re loan because the system did it as an ACH , and not a debit . Which meant I had to wait till the next Wednesday for it to clear the advance America system . Maybe more of an alert would help for customers  to know this . It does state it in the agreement but It is easily over looked . In better news if I could make it to Wednesday’s without Re loaning , I figured I might as well get out all together. So it worked out well for me .",1

I felt like an intruder. The person asked my social a few times and my name despite me giving her my identification. She proceeded to tell me that I wasn't in the system and I just seemed to annoy her. I was polite and asked questions because her silence other than telling me what she needed and that I wasn't in the system was uncomfortable. Not the normal here.,2
Kara was so polite and patient,I just borrowed the money like 3 days ago and yesterday i am already receiving calls and emails for payment tomorrow so irs useless borrowing from you if you want us to pay it right away..not even 10 days.it is always like that.you can check my history,2
I arrived @ 1:30 pm Friday afternoon…,"I do not how this scam of a company is still doing business.  Out of curiosity I completed the first step: that alone signs I ignored.

Really? Username and password? I might have been born day before yesterday, but I know better. I stopped the process.What concerns me is the rating this ""business"" has received.  I will hazard a guess and write that the others whom supposedly received a loan from this ""business,"" gave out their personal (online) banking information. I find that incredibly difficult to believe. Most likely they are fake reviews; perhaps people paid to write positive reviews for Advance America.I do not believe Advance America will like or reply to this review.STAY AWAY from Advance America!!!",1

She speaks down to you when you are in their office and seems to dislike helping people.  If at all possible,  I would only have dealings with Ms. Mignon,  but I don't know what her schedule is.  So I'm going to pay back my loan and if I find myself needing another, I will go elsewhere.   As there are so many choices,  it's disappointing that the company has not provided better training to their managers.

The in-store services are wonderful,Misleading interest rate info provided by staff. Staff says only $20 interest on $100. They forget to add that it is for a 2 week period only. The info sheet in the store 9on the wall) shows an APR of 533%+ which the staff does not let you know. All info should be clearly explained by staff prior to processing loan so that customer knows how much trouble he is getting into.Store is clean and good for social distancing. Staff was courteous and helpful.,1

I am really upset that my amount won't…,"The last rude rep I spoke to reversed my loan!!! I told her I wish I had done it a few days later to be due the following paycheck. She told me that there was no guarantee on how soon I could redo the loan. So to be safe I said I’ll keep it how it is. The money got spent on bills. Now you’re trying to reverse it????  Please leave the loan how it was , I never signed anything to cancel the loan or authorized it to be canceled. You will make multiple things in my account bounce. If your rude rep did this in retaliation, please fix ASAP!!!Thank you and this is the first time I’ve had any issue with your company. And the first time the customer service was horrible. I will correct my review if they fix the issues caused on my account. Allison W10/29- I had to solve the situation with my bank. Long process to supposedly try to fix Advance America’s mistake. A lot time & frustration. Supervisor seemed willing to help but wasn’t reachable at my non work hours. She said she had to listen to my calls & look at my emails... I knew she’d see I wasn’t lying, but still a bit insulting. After I was proven right after hearing the call, I still had to wait for her to find the emails. This was ridiculous dealing with from 10/21-10/28. Could have left a solution through my email which I gave permission but still wouldn’t. Or even fix the account so the notes would be there for any rep to read to me. So there were multi-phone rep issues and multi email issues. I gave up & will just be paying the loan off in full tomorrow.  FYI: if my bank wasn’t kind enough to fix this for me, it would have cost me 4 NSF charges and all 4 items returned. And those places could charge returned charge fees as well. So disappointed!AW",2
The lady that helped me with the loan…,My local store has always been a place I have enjoyed going and a much needed financial relieve during tough times. Until this past Friday.

John does the most amazing job,Your customer service representative was top notch professional!!Your top management does not know what they are doing because it closed the Lyon Township office...very poor customer service by top management!!,2
She was a new employee,Ok. They approved me for my loan I agreed to the terms. Then they tried to make me pay 100 dollars first then they would make a western union transfer or money gram only they would not accept my  account numbers through an FDIC backed banking establishment. I use my netspend card only if it's good enough for the govt why not a advance america? When you can only do what you can do and have no way to pay the tax thing they ask for because you pay your bills. Why then would you pay a loan place up front you'd take all applicable taxes out of the loan amount and the loan would be settled on their monthly withdrawals from your account. Bad business burden. The rates good the loans good customer service and hoops bad.,2
I think-that it’s good what y’all are…,I haven't received my funding as promised,1

And my bank is open. I called and asked if there was anyway to expedite the process so I can get the money today and they offered no help. Not very happy with my first time ever using this kind of service. I will not be returning.,1
Poor customer service,"the day I went in there, I had changed bank accounts, unfortunately, and forgot to bring my bank statement. My phone was not working, and I was trying to get it activated, nothing was working, so I went home, and got my statemen. After I came back, I was treated kind of rudely, I thought, because, the girl working that morning, was too busy flirting with the guy ahead of me to try to get to me, after I already been there an hour before with all the technical problems. I've been going there for years, so she knew me, that's why I felt the way I did. I know, I was a problem, because she had to wait to see if I could get my phone to work, but, I didn't keep her waiting long. I just drove back home and grabbed my bank statement.",1

The money was deposited on my debit card and was to withdraw the payment on the debit card. I was NEVER told that the transaction could take up to 10 days.

A reasonable interest rate is like a credit union (Tyndall.org is very low but they do well and so does the world's largest credit union, Navy Federal Credit Union).  The reason I borrow is because I give my money to people I don't even know to help them.  Ever heard what our Creator said through His sinless Son about not storing up treasurers on earth?

You denied me,why are you closing your Huntington store will not drive 25miles to Wabash store will go to check into cash here in Huntington thanks anyway,1
I have always got a loan with you guys…,Got a loan from this place online. They get their money on the same day the loan is due and clears that night. Their system says 3 to 5 business days to clear which is a crock. This is not the 80s no longer where it takes that long. I called and asked if the lady could just verify that it cleared and same response. Have to wait 3 business days which means I'm waiting 5 since its the weekend. Would recommend staying away from this place if you need money faster and on limited income as they could care less and still running like its the 80s.,1
Great job,"I sometimes have money problems, and you guys are not very flexible when it comes to paying back the loans if I get on a payment plan I feel like if I only have $50 that payday that all I should have to pay that keeps me from borrowing more from you cause you split into 3 payments  I can't always afforded that",2
Old Asian lady is rude as hell,I applied yesterday and have gotten no feedback on whether it was approved or not. As far as I’m concerned I’ll never deal with this company again. The process is not supposed to take this long,1
Waited 10,You guy charged my account one ahead of my set pay date for no reason. I retired I get paid on the last day of each month. This month(September)has 30 days in it. You guy took the funds on the 29th of this month for no reason. Not good. My account was overdrawn and in the negative.,2

Your computer was done; that I understand but the incompetence of your ppl was over the pale.

They barely speak English & the fact I gave them my debit card & they claimed it didn’t go through because  of the computer & to try later in the day. I happened to go to my bank and I find out the payment had gone through, the money was deducted from my account! I called these ppl back and asked for a receipt since the payment had gone through & no one could send me a receipt. I even called your corporate office & got nowhere. So you had my money but I had no proof except for my bank. To get a copy from my bank would cost me a fee. It was horrible and I ended up with chest pains. I finally got an email from your corporate office at 11:45 pm that night, almost 12 hours after the money was deducted from my account.I have been a customer for over 12 years and I have never seen such incompetence. I had to get some money yesterday but I went to the storefront where I always went for years. I followed your employee Betsy to the other store, but now that she is gone and after my experience last week, I will never return. I will get you paid off and never return.

My Experience,Ayanna was very helpful and shes a very nice person,1
Absolute worst company to deal with,No offense but I do better when I go into the office because at least I get my money then I still haven't gotten my money 3 days later going online and doing this crap,1
You denied me a loan,Staff was wonderful HOWEVER I received this review questionare BEFORE I have received the money..The money that was supposed to be INSTANTLY deposited in my account is NOT  yet deposited !!! This has caused me extreme problems because the money was for a family medical EMERGENCY!! I had thought twice about useing Advance America because this EXACT same thing happened to me the.last time. Last time I had used the on line service so this time I went in person to the store hoping to avoid any problems...apparently it makes no difference!!! I probably will never use Advance America again!!!Only reason they got any stars is because the staff was very nice.,1
Best n excellent service,It said I would get my money in 30 minutes and it's been over 24 hours and still do not have my money.,1
Not good Advance America,Simply put - the last two times I’ve used your company u had no cash on hand.   Then it cost me money to cash ur check (which two places would not honor)!!!!   Won’t use u again if u do not keep cash on hand.   J Campbell,1
Yes you did great,The customer service was great! They gave me a check for some unheard of bank that was rude and told me they only have part time tellers by apt only! I don't have a regular bank cost me $15.00 to cash the check! I am not happy. I was told they would let someone know. Not fair to me as a customer at all!,1
Late payments,I don't know who this lady was the day I went but she's rude as hell. Her customer service skills is none existing. She had her mom or someone on the speaker phone the who time. Then got upset sucking her teeth because she had to do work. Smh it was a fast experience but if this is customer service review she gets an F!,2
Online loan payments,"They advertise that they give loans ""up to $1,000!""  This is BS.  I make an average of over $7k/month and have PERFECT credit on 20 open lines of credit and yet was only given $400, presumably because my FICO score was only a 620, which is low due to credit cards being maxed out, which is why I needed to come to this lender of last resort in the first place.  People that come here have low FICO scores (usually because they have bad credit), not because they enjoy paying 90% APR to borrow money for short term periods.  Offering to loan $1k to people with high FICO scores when you charge 90% interest is a baseless claim, as no one with a high FICO score would borrow money at such ridiculous rates - they would just go to their bank.  Like most other payday lenders, they only really loan $400, although both ACE and MoneyTree loaned me $1k each, so I would suggest taking your business there instead of visiting these clowns.",2

I went in for a payday loan and i wanted it deposited directly to my bank. she scanned by debit card and told me she was getting an error ""funds not available""? For a deposit. Anyhow I didnt want to argue with her cause she immediately told me shed have to give me cash, which I don't prefer. So I had to take the cash to my bank for deposit which i dont feel safe doing and its inconvenient. I had also gone in on Saturday, 9/12/20, and when she pulled up my account she asked if i get my next check on 10/14. I told her i wasnt sure of the date but it is the second wednesday. Her response was ""You cant get a loan today. I asked why and she said i had to wait till 9/14. Doesnt converse in a friendly manner at all. Also I received a coupon to get $20 off next loan or payday. How do I get this?",1

I fact I have been a client of you all since 2009. When I came in August to renew under the new rules I was totally rejected. I was told I could not get a loan with you guys even though told my credit was good with you all and you all did not understand why that wS happening. And now I can finally get a loan with you all and all I can get is 100.00 dollars. I am very hurt do please don’t ask me for a review.,1

I've never had a problem until August 2020 (I've been a customer many times over there previous years). I just got loan and that transaction went fine except they took the first payment out 2 weeks BEFORE I was paid, draining my bank account, leaving my account in the red, with no way to fix it. $35 a day overcharge fee for 2 weeks.

I worked 2 jobs for 7 years trying to avoid having to file bankruptcy after getting laid off from one job and then having a bunch of things break down on me. Unfortunately, I ended up having medical issues that left me no choice but to discharge my debt. As much as I didn't want to, there was a sense of relief to not have debt collectors constantly calling. That was short-lived, however. Advance Americal started calling and demanding payment. I did realize they were missed on the paperwork, although since the debt was incurred before my discharge they are still included. My lawyer contacted them and they stopped calling for 6 months before they started again. I let them know again that it was discharged, the woman on the phone just yelled at me that they were just trying to collect what I owed even after I pointed out it was discharged. At this point, they won't stop calling (a couple of times a day) and I may have to pay another lawyer. They know the debt was discharged, they're just hoping if they harass me enough I will pay the debt even though legally I don't have to. I'm editing this to add that I called the customer comment line and was told by the bot after they verified my account that they are closed for Christmas and will open again on the 26th. For the record, I am calling on January 21. At this point, 3 years after I incurred the debt and 2 years after I declared bankruptcy, I am getting 3-4 calls a day from Advance America. I may have to change my number because each time I block their number they just call from a different one. Plain and simple, this is harassment. Now I will have to get another lawyer. Seriously, there are better places to get loans from, just go somewhere else.",1
Misleading interest rate info provided…,My experience with Advanced America has been awesome . The team at the Port Charlotte location has always been extremely helpful and caring and friendly.,2

"Usually a great company, last rep horrible!",Applied for loan on line money was not deposited when said. Money still has not been deposited into my account.,2
My local store has always been a place…,My experience for this application was abysmal. The store experience has been excellent. The only reason that I stopped using you in favor of Amscot is due to your closed on Sunday and Amscot’s having a 24 hour location in Palm Bay. We needed a payday advance last night around 10 pm and the spouse has been using your application for a bit so I decided to give your application a try. So I put in the first application. I realize there would be no way I would get it that night but the small print at the bottom said it would appear in the bank the next day. I didn’t worry about it until I woke up just before work and found the money had not deposited and I had an email telling me to “resign” the paperwork which I did. This was at 10:08 am. The second application that was entered. I called and talked to a representative about this second application which stayed in Pending Review. She informed me it was approved. 10 minutes later I receive another email telling me that my application was not approved and was awaiting more information. I called the second time and was told that email was sent in error. I was going to cancel the application and go back to Amscot but I was told it would take an hour for it to clear. The money did show up right at 5 pm causing me to miss lunch due to not having the money I needed when I needed it. If I had just gone to Amscot in the first place a lot of stress would have been avoided.,1
I was told I was approved for a loan…,I have been a very good customer for many years. The gentlemen that assisted me with the new loan told me he needed to do a credit check and it would not show up on my credit. I told him how important it was that it did not show up on my credit. He assured me that it would not. Well it did and it's going to be on there for 2 years. I will never do business with this company again!,2

Did not receive my email documents.,"I called in to see if this location cold assist people who use Instacart and they said yes. I walk in after working 6 hours on a very hot day and I was treated so rudely I could not believe what was happening. The person at the counter did everything she could possibly do to stop me from getting a loan all while saying I've never done this before and that I wouldn't qaualify because my gross income and net income were not written out in bold letters on my bank statements. From her saying saying she has never heard of Instacart, a business she is supposed to offer services for to her questioning why my income fluctuated is beyond disturbing. I was told to bring in my bank statements and I did everything I could do to explain to a young girl who has no business handling people's finances while she uses her phone to text right in front of me when I ask her what my loan amount is makes me so angry. I repeated what I needed to over and over and she didn't listen to a word of it only to ask me if my bank account was actually open. She made me calculate my income with a pen and paper when I handed her all the info that was required. She called multiple managers to hand hold her through the process telling them I wouldn't qualify. At the end I asked her what my limit was and she said it be something like 250 which is what I needed to get my car going. When I told her that would be fine she said sorry actually umm it's 150 and laughed. To think that she would personally allow  me to only get what she thought was okay makes me sick. I asked her why is did that and she said sorry I don't know. When signing my agreement I was reading through the fine print only to be told you don't ha e to read that you will get it emailed makes her sound like a crook. At the end when she handed me what she thought I deserved I asked her what would be the corporate office number and she shut me down and said why would you want that and that if I had any complaints I should call the store manager as that was my only option. I waited till the end not knowing if she would deny me a loan because I may put in a complaint. Took her 3 times to give up her name to me. I have a feeing nothin .ore than a slap to the wrist will be handed down to a young adult who who should be immediately removed from the job despite not knowing her training because she smiles and knods her head to the right people. If anyone can find out what amount for a loan was actually permitted and what she gave is is the same or not will tell you what kind of person she is and make me wonder how many people or family's she will treat unprofessionaly because they just got off of work and are not dressed to impress for her",1

I attempted to tell her that I resent the front of the check  and  the previous rep told me that I can upload my check. The current rep said well she gave me the wrong information and my account was closed!  (If rep did not have a copy of the front of the check, why would she say account was closed? I just told her thank you very much and hung up. Next thing I knew my loan was funded. So we had three different people spewing out different information and that’s not a good thing because I enjoy using Advance America went in need!In addition when I use the mobile app to apply for a loan, I always get spam email of other companies  requesting that I complete their application for funding. I don’t understand how they’re getting my information or why they would even be asking me this when I have no idea who they are!  thank you",1
Staff was great...Advance America IS NOT!!!,Customer service was horrendous!!!,1
It said I would get my money in 30…,"i do not like the attitude I get at their location Greeneville,tn.",2
Simply put,"I usually have great service at this location (9112 Camp Bowie W Blvd Ste 120 in Ft Worth) but recently there has been a high turnover at this location and new management.  Also, because of my experience there yesterday I will never do business at here again!  And I've been a loyal customer for years.  We were in the middle of a transaction and a lady walked in screaming and causing a scene. She demanded that one of the two employees, that were both busy helping customers, stop what they were doing and take her loan payment right now.  She was threatening everyone in the building if she didn't get help.  She was cursing and going in and out of the building.  The manager firmly asked her to leave so then the customer wanted to talk with a supervisor in which the manager gave her a phone number.  I told the M.I.T., Katherine, that she needs to do something about it because I felt threatened and my nerves were bad.  This was a volatile environment and I refuse to do business with anyone who will not rectify the situation immediately.  I also asked them if they still had to locks for he doors and they just ignored me.  The lady went out and came back in two to three times and what if one of those times she brought a gun back.  The issues with this scenario are several: the management never escalated the manner, the management also did not even attempt to protect the customers already present, and didn't even apologize to us for the horrible experience.  Corporate needs to address and resolve this complaint immediately!",1
The customer service was great,Only needed a $100 payday advance for 3 days. Don't have and credit issues and a nice score. Denied me... and now a hard inquiry.,1
No Customer service....,"I love it. Less paper work. Thanks for making it easier, I don't always have a blank check.",2
Maximum loan amount is really only $400,"Was approved for 1000 decided to only ask for 500 loan, next day came back and decided to ask for 1000, clerk took back the 500 and said they change their mind I was only approved for 300, need money to travel to California to buried mother, so I only ended with 300, what a way to do business tell customer one thing and five minutes later something else really, probably would never come back and would tell others not to used their services",1
I will post review and post full page…,Used the online application for the first time and it was a horrible experience.  Agent that I talked to messed up my bank account information so the money was sent to a non opened account even after I called in and provided the correct account information.  Then I was told it was going to take 3+ days for this to be corrected and for me to be eligible to reapply.  Not an ideal situation when you need cash services to help out till your next payday.  This was a horrible experience and I will not be using them in the future.,1
Poor customer service.,"I WANTED TO HAVE THE LOAN PUT ON MY DEBIT CARD AND IT WAS DECLINED REASON:, TO MANY DECLINES, WELL THE ONLY REASON IT PROBABLY SHOWED THAT IS BECAUSE i FORGOT i CAN ONLY HAVE A SINGLE CHARGE LIMIT OF $500.00 AND I NEEDED $555.00. THEREFORE I NEEDED TO MAKE TWO TRANSACTIONS ,ONE FOR $500.00 AND ONE FOR $55.00 which I did to payoff the loan . Now I have to wait longer than I should have . Not a happy camper !!!!",2

You did very badly,Imagine Advance America is your buddy that always says he's here to help. But when you go ask for his help he wants too much for his help so it's almost not even worth it. But in a bind it does help. 5 month loan of $340 cash in hand out the door. But you gotta pay $100 a month for 5 months. So on $340 you have to pay $160 extra. Which is about half of what they gave you. So expect to pay back X1.5. I'm on disability and they made it easy to get a loan. But at the same time my tight budget is stretched pretty far by an extra $100/month. Avoid unless you absolutely need the money. The process is quick and easy. But paying back the money can be a hassle. That's how their company is designed.  It's a predatory loan for low income people struggling to make ends meet. I didn't want to put extra on my credit cards this month so I got a loan out and it would've been cheaper to put it on credit. Luckily I'm in a pretty good position and I'm just using the money to build a computer. The extra $160 im paying is worth not waiting another month or 2 to complete my build while keeping my credit card utilization low. Dont make it a regular thing. Get the loan in a pinch and forget they exist.,1

Somehow my account number was changed or entered incorrectly to an entire different bank that I’ve never banked with & the money I needed still has not been deposited. Then on top of that they are so called closed on Tuesdays. A normal business day and now I have to wait a whole 5 days to receive my money but it is expected that I pay the loan on time. If it wasn’t for COVID-19 and being on a strict budget I’d wouldn’t take out the loan now. But believe me I’ll never ever take another loan out with Advance America EVER again.,1

The whole purpose of coming to your store is because I need cash! I have to pay to receive the cash, then I have to pay to cash a check. No other cash advance business is run this way. I honestly use every other cash advance store any time I can other then Advance America because of this issue. This really needs to be reviewed and fixed. On a very lucky day when I come in, they do have cash because I was lucky enough someone came in to pay back a loan. This is a serious problem! I hear many people talk about this issue and how they refuse to come to your business. You are losing customers!  Customers shouldn’t have to receive a check when you advertise you are a payday loan business and people can receive $445.00 CASH!

Your new system is great,"I no longer have an open acct. with this co. & never will again. I've tried to maintain a positive relationship with them but they've made it more than difficult. They're so hillbilly that they made a feeble attempt at going online claiming to improve the process. I decided to test it to see how it works. They were able to take my payment with zero issues. But when it came time to reloan as I was told I'd be able to do, 4 days later no money showed up in my account. The system said if you did it before 10:30 AM you'd get it the same day. I got the ""you're approved pending"" notice on line, did it between 6 & 7 AM so I should've had the money right? NO money ever showed in my acct. & no 1 contacted me to say there was a problem. I had to call the store to find out when they did their conversion, they transferred acct. #s that were no longer valid & other outdated info. But for some reason didn't have any of the info the store had in a file almost 2 reams of paper thick! There should be laws against harboring customer info! I was horrified by the amount of $ I'd paid over the yrs. How's it possible that you can't transfer info entered in your system repeatedly on a bi-weekly basis when you do a conversion? What is wrong with this picture? Certainly isn't the customers fault! I was made to believe it was! This co. is way too hillbilly & can't seem to figure out their own systems. I was told when I called the store that there was no loan present, they tried to credit closed accts. & 1 I didn't recognize without ever contacting me - the customer - to clarify the info & figure out what the problem was! This is not a co. that focuses on or perfected customer service. They just shut down when there's a problem without picking up a phone or sending email communication to request you contact them to resolve them. What is that all about? It's called incompetence at its finest! I got into a bit of a tiff with the store manager, for which I'm sorry because it's not her fault & I like her, but I'm angery about how poorly this co. handles its business. Technically it's not the stores fault. I love the people there & will miss them. But that was the very last straw for me with this co. They've just made too many errs. I was in the hospital because I had emergency surgery in 2018. I called when I was able to let them know I was still admitted & couldn't leave until the dr. released me. They wobbled on giving me an extension! I'm in the hospital & you can't extend an on time, long term customer a small courtesy outside of your boxed in thinking & whack policies? Really? I was mad then & still am! I paid them off with that crack pot online system recently, replaced them 4 days later with another more up to date co. that doesn't have ridiculous policies & isn't so greedy they keep you trapped in loans that deplete your income by $90 every mo. for a $300 loan that's only $255 anyway, but you still have to pay $300, that is open to extensions when/where needed with far, far better customer service & smarter employees! I was looking for a way to pay them off & get rid of that payday loan trap. They just made it happen 20 times faster. They suck & I say find another co. who has online mastered. I could name off quite a few co.'s I've had great experiences with in the past but I know that's not allowed. So AA should consider themselves lucky! If I could single handily destroy their business I would! What I can do is write the CA Dept. of Business Oversight, the CA Atty. General & CA Governor to report the issues I've had with them. I'll support the pending bill to end the payday loans in CA to get these hard money lenders out of our state by writing my Senators for keeping hard working American's pockets empty by taking advantage of us. The $90 a month you pay them thereby traps you in a debt that's extremely hard to get out of & isn't worth it! Figure it out, pay them off & report them to the state govt. to end their reign of greed!",1

I needed to pay back a loan and take out another loan so the clerk that was assisting me went to ask the manager about my account. When the clerk returned with the manager the manager stated "" you stormed out of here last week so we couldn't help you!""  I had no idea of she was talking about? I told her that ""I didn't want to argue and that I just wanted to take out a loan.""  I have used your services previously and have always paid back loans.  But I will discontinue using services with unprofessional employees or managers like her...",2
The girl at the counter was very…,The associated are rude to the customers over the phone and in person,1
My honest opinion,I am always approved for more at home on my computer than I am allowed to borrow in the marianna fl office. If I go to a different office will the same thing happen or will I be given what the website approves me for at home?,1
My regular office I pay on my account…,"I had a Stacy help me in Papillion, Ne.She is so, so, rude. I had leaned over the counter to give her my check. She looked at me with a very angry face and said don't lean over my counter. Stacy said you don't do that at the bank do you. I have had other people tell me how horrible she is. I didn't believe them until this happened. She should be fired. I have been in sales all my life, never would I ever treat anyone like she did. You are definately losing business.",2
Very professional,"I would have left 5 stars if the two weeks till my next check was actually two weeks before they took the money. So if you get paid every two weeks, and you chose to apply online, you get the money and everything is great, except they will take the money out of your bank the day BEFORE you get paid. So beware because you end up paying bank fees because they take the money out the day before the two weeks.",2
Okay,"Not happy with such a short one week time to repay.  I’ve requested that this be extended to the following payday (which was the expected day day), but have received no reply.  Disappointed.",1
You guys usually do a 5 star but this…,I have been a loyal customer for a while now because of the ease and no stress way of doing business that you offer.,2
Educate your phone people,"I dont like the fact that I was told I would be declined the next time I need a loan by your manager in the Livingston,Tx office. I will not be back there and will go somewhere else. And the way she talks to your clients is very rude, she is loud and very obnoxious to people. Not very professional at all.",1
I am still waiting on my loan that was…,wasn't informed of the three time roll over had to pay cash b 4 she would rewrite new loan,1
I’m giving you a one due to the fact…,The company switched to online services and now they take your money out before your paycheck even clears!! Horrible services and the manager wasn’t helpful at all!!!,1
