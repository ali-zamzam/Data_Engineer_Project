Well for starters you charging me a‚Ä¶,Well for starters you charging me a dollar 95 per transaction on top of that $10 a month monthly fee so I don't have $1.95 most transactions that's highway robbery the only reason I got this card is cuz I assumed it would be like every other app card where they don't charge you per fee per charge they charge you for a fee for the ATM but no NetSpend is trash you guys are lucky that I still use it when my other cards come in this one's toast.,1
I hate that every single time I use my card NetSpend charge a fee.,Everytime I use my card there's a charge. Everytime I load money on my card there's a charge. NetSpend charge for everything I really don't like that. Then there's the lies about the fees that's charged that gets under my skin more than I can explain.,3
My old card got locked due to online‚Ä¶,My old card got locked due to online fraud. I had a replacement card.

Transfer repeatedly. 3 of the people I talked to were not helpful very rude.,2
THE AGENT THAT I SPOKE TO,THE AGENT THAT I SPOKE TO WAS VERY UNSERSTANDING TO MY SITUATION. She was encouraging & had the most humble voice I have ever experienced.

They charge $1.50 for every purchase‚Ä¶,"They charge $1.50 for every purchase transaction. That is a lot of money to use my own money. And the card is weird at gas stations. Puts a hold on purchases that are not gas at the pump. Very expensive. Bank account is much better way. I only got this to help me budget my spending money, but this defeats the purpose.",2

Thanks,4
I definitely like NetSpend and the ease‚Ä¶,I definitely like NetSpend and the ease of transferring money back and forth with my cash app and I like that it's so easy to withdraw the only thing I could recommend would just be to lower the fees each month and watch about double charging them other than that I love NetSpend All Access,5
My new Netspend card account doesn‚Äôt‚Ä¶,"My new Netspend card account doesn‚Äôt show up on the card/accounts page, probably because the website kicks me over to the HEBprepaid page when I try to log into Netspend for my new card, which isn‚Äôt an HEBPrepaid card.",1
Terrible company,I had netspend when I was in Denver Colorado and when I moved to New Jersey I informed them that I was moving and the dates I would be traveling.  Each day of my journey my account was locked because they said activity was outside the area I lived in.  Every night after traveling all day I would spend an hour or two arguing with the reps about my account and how I told them prior to my move that I was moving.  Terrible company and terrible customer service.,1
I didn't get the full amount returned‚Ä¶,"I didn't get the full amount returned to be after my money was stolen I received a call back from corporate office, the agent was extremely rude, sarcastic, cocky and disrespectful, when I stated this he replied, ""I'm replying according to how you speak""",2
EVERY TIME I CALL I GET THE WORST‚Ä¶,EVERY TIME I CALL I GET THE WORST SERVICE POSSIBLE. i HAVE YET TO GET MY PROBLEM SOLVED BY JUST 1 PERSON. i AM ALWAYS SENT TO SOMEONE ELSE WHO MUST SEND ME TO ANOTHER DEPARTMENT THAT HAS NO CLUE ON HOW TO DO THERE JOB. LOOKING FOR ANOTHER CARD,1

I had a frad attempt they did freeze my‚Ä¶,I had a frad attempt they did freeze my account but lucky I had a card that they had sent months ago. Even if I didn't they had a new card in my mail box the next day.,5
My balance was to be transferred‚Ä¶,"My balance was to be transferred October 13 from the card NetSpend decided to cancel. Today, October 20th, I spoke to one of representatives trying to get this rectified. She very rudely told me to have a nice day and hung up on me. As of today, my account is short $1647.75. Where is MY money???",1
I have tried other prepaid accounts‚Ä¶,"I have tried other prepaid accounts before.  I had an issue with one and didn't feel comfortable continuing with them.  So, I'm giving Netspend a try and so far I have not been disappointed.  I love the feature of creating a virtual card for online purchases.  I love how easy it was to cash a check through the mobile app.  Such a time saver and relief to not have to go out and cash it somewhere else.  I would recommend this card to anyone who needs it.  The only thing I would change is the ability to have the chip feature and tap and pay with the card.  I'm not sure logistically if that would be feasible but it would be a great add on and make me feel like I'm not missing out on being with a local bank.",5
Between two ferns,"So I'm not learned in banking so much. With that said is there a way to transfer funds from NetSpend to ,let's say, pay pal or cash app without the recipient making a Flash ID account? Thanks for the concern",3

Kept explaining to him what account he could not give me any information regarding this other account asked for supervisor and was told you don‚Äôt want to speak a supervisor you will be on hold for a very long time! Was on hold first time for over 40 min then someone else came on only to go through scenario again placed on hold again another 40 minutes by now on the phone for over a hour and a half they all just kept repeating the same thing over and over again with no solution to help me on how to resolve this Very unhappy with customer Service level,1

Good job,I appreciate all you do.  If you think there is something that doesn't look right you let me know.  Whenever a transaction has been made you inform me of it.  Thank-you for all you do.  :),5
Good service,I had an old account that I had a negative balance in and when I got my government benefits from unemployment NetSpend put a hold on my account and snatched the past two balance from my old account and held my money until further notice unannounced and I was unaware of this it just happened immediately,5
Very satisfied!!,I absolutely love you guys!!! Your app is easy and fast u guys super nice on phone!! Iam so glad I have u guys!!,5
The card was great,Short wait times and friendly staff It was nice talking to someone I could understand,5
1-5 I give it 5!!!,My experience is great with Netspend. I love depositing money at Walgreens. I can‚Äôt wait to be able to order checks. Thank you Netspend for letting me reorder the Visa Debit. Netspend.,5
Great,It is always great using your prepaid cash Card when I need it.,5
I have been a member  of Netspend for years‚Ä¶,"The Check Load feature is really awesome, but the fees on every purchase and the problems I have with the app almost aren't worth it.",5
Im realy happy with nerspend and i get‚Ä¶,My card came quickly and customer service was great,5
My husband & I love NetSpend,I like getting my money early.,5

1st review,I love the card and what is to offer,4
When calling,I love my new account! Everything has been so easy!,3
the  maxim card,I hate your guys account you don't take in account for the customer,5
I love using netspend,It‚Äôs great I really like Netspend very handy,5
Fraudulent charges were not reimbursed‚Ä¶,I did not like NetSpend at all because they charged me $1.95 each time I swiped it I could buy a 50 cent pack of bubble gum and it would cost me $1.95 just to buy it okay now if I had to go to the ATM and it was $3 then I paid $4.95 if I went to an ATM and it was $5 then I paid $6.95 it's just a rip off,1
MUCH EASIER TO MANAGE THAN A CREDIT‚Ä¶,NetSpend does everything that they say they do. I would recommend them to everybody,5
"Can't find the link for referrals,",Not one thing per say just the all around service provided has been great. They notified me the other night about what they thought might have been a fraudulent purchase. They ask if it was me making the purchase. Told them it was and was able to continue the sale. I really appreciate that.,3
So far my experience with NetSpend‚Ä¶has been great,NetSpend is a good card get paid early    people always try to help when u need it,5
Great services,I like the app it‚Äôs just the monthly fee is extremely unnecessary but overall great app!ü§ùüèΩ,5
This card charges for every transaction‚Ä¶,"On this day of October, I got a deposit that was very helpful to me. My NetSpend crew came thru with flying colors. Thank you....",2
They charge you almost 2 $ every time‚Ä¶,Don't  like the fact that netspend closed my account for no reason,1
They do I good job,Being charged for a prepaid card can‚Äôt believe it. I will not be using the account again,5
As always when ever I call and who ever‚Ä¶,What I was needing done for business was handled professionally and on a great level,5
Good,My last card expired with money still on it. Then I had to get a whole new card so that money is gone I guess üòû,5
Overall customer service is horrible,I had trouble with social security about my money and talking to netspend agents they were able to tell me what was wrong. They were so nice about explaining what need to be done. I love to thank them so much.,1
I had the worst attitude towards me‚Ä¶,Very easy to set up and use,2
I get easy access to my acct.and my‚Ä¶,It is my favorite Bank out of all banks and the easiest! And trust me I have tried almost all the banks LOL,5
I use my card daily it‚Äôs great,"It's the best and easy to use card on the market,while someone next to me on a line in a popular store was having difficulty using her card,mines had no problem going thru,love my NetSpend. I pay my bills, recharge my family's phone anywhere and buy online.",5
Netspend works,"My experience being a NetSpend member has been excellent not having to wait for an approval of an application process to quickly become a member when I needed a new bank membership with no credit check or a deposit to join. I haven't had the experience of using any of the services yet, but I am expecting it will be an excellent service as well!",5
Great!!,The charge for each use is highThat‚Äôs why I barely use it,5
Netspend was fine at first,I really appreciate you guys and the ways of this kind of stuff!!!! Keep doing the right thing,2
Very friendly,Very quick and easy mobile check deposit I would use 5 stars but the load fee is a little pricey would love it to drop like a few bucks.,5
I didn't have any problems at all,My overall experience with NetSpend have been one of professional courtesy,5
Nothing to say at this time,"I made a cash deposit on a Sunday night. When I tried using the cash I loaded on my card, I was locked and blocked from my account. I was very upset to say the least. It took 2 days to resolve my issue after emailing personal identification documents and undergoing interrogation twice. I still wasn‚Äôt given a clear answer as to why I was ‚Äúred flagged‚Äù, other than the red flags are ‚Äúcomputer generated‚Äù whatever that means. I never heard of such a thing. Maybe if I was doing suspicious activity, then ok I get it. I don‚Äôt like not having access to my hard earned money. I think CashApp is waaaaay better and that‚Äôs where my money will be!",5
Opening my account was so easy and am‚Ä¶,The set-up of my account was easy and all the instructions were clear.  Very nice indeed.,5
I got a fraud alert on my card and I‚Ä¶,I was overcharged from ABC cleanup company.  Now my account is in negative status.  Customer service didn‚Äôt help and I could understand his broken English.  Not very happy!,1
I appreciate all you do,Have had a great experience so. Been approx 2 and half years.,5
Netspend restricted my account unexpectedly,I love this bank,3
I hate how every transaction I get charged by netspend every time I purchase something,Your agents need to be retrained security straightened out the card ending in 3905 for me and let it go through I looked into the app and saw that I had a $29.95 balance the day after that I tried to get into the account and I couldn't get into the account and the agent that took over told me I had to get a new replacement card because the 3905 card wasn't no good so I did that I got the card the other day meaning Thursday of this week and I still couldn't get into the account the young lady that I talked to was very observant very helpful very kind considerate and she explained to me that the account was closed well I know security did not close it whoever the guy was who the next day took the account he's the one that closed it and told me I had to get a new card he's the one that needs to be retrained or fired,1
Great experience,I've had the card for 4 years now..and Love it!!!!,5
I absolutely love you guys!!,"NetSpend is easy to use,quick, and convenient.",5
Great service,"They were suppose to send me a new card and didn't. Do not see my balance on my phone when I go to the ATM, it suppose to inform me whenever I use the ATM and it doesn't.",5
My experience is great with Netspend,As a returning client was given horrible service if the person had a strong accent.  When asked to speak to supervisor was always placed on hold for over an hour then hung up on. I'm actually leaving the company next month cause experience was so horrible,5
The all access card is awesome üëçüëç,I cant get more than 260 dollars from the ATM at any time,5
It is always great using your prepaid‚Ä¶,Yes I've enjoyed the NetSpend I've had other cards that I have had nothing but trouble with..... NetSpend has always been reliable I've always been able to get a hold of somebody to talk to you when there's been a problem which there have been but only a couple I have had other cards that have done nothing but trouble I've been using NetSpend and NetSpend All Access for 4 years,5
I give it a 3.,My transaction was declined however my card was still charged.,2
Slow service,Really like the new Access card. Easy to use and accepted by more merchants,1
I have been so consumed Ed about by day,This is not a good service they are trying to keep my money they won't transfer my money to my other account,5
My card came quickly and customer‚Ä¶,I did not know that using my card meant that I would have to pay $1.95 each time. I do not like this part of the use of this card. Probably go back to my other card/account.,5
I like getting my money early,"My SSI payment was received by NetSpend account was not return back to my bank wells Fargo bank my card was stolen and reported,trun off where is my money.",5
Great company keep up the great job,I was a little surprised that I was charged a $5 service fee when I only had the card a couple of days and I didn't like that too much and if I'm going to be charged $5 every month I might not be keeping the card just because that's not what's best for me but the card itself in the account is okay,5
Friendly customer service they actually‚Ä¶,"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.",5
Great card,I got charged twice this month for a monthly fee . I knew when I loaded it it would charge me but 8 days after I just got charged again.  I'm MAD!!! That money was to pay my disabled sons bills.  I had to pay 4 to load then 5 for a fee then get charged again another 5 for the feeüò°,5
Love it,I had a great experience with my NetSpend Card account. Always friendly and respectful employees. I know I will always have great service when I call.,5
I love my new account,Netspend is very useful and I wouldn‚Äôt change it for the world.,5
I hate your guys account you don't take‚Ä¶,They protect your account and watch over i have had netspend since 2012 and love them,1
Very helpful and respectful,I got a refund from Comcast/Xfinity  for $ 50.00. I need the cash on my card not darn overdraft fees . I'm ticked  I may change to a different  card service if my $50 isn't avable in 4 days period. There is  things I need bad,5
It‚Äôs great I really like Netspend very‚Ä¶,I don‚Äôt even know where to start with this review I have used Netspend for a very long time a lot of money has gone in and out through your company however the last few months you have really screwed me at the worst time in my life you‚Äôve made it more difficult you have closed accounts when people were using my account I still had funds in there yet you have no idea where those funds went and try to say that you‚Äôve released them to me when I‚Äôve never received them And once again my funds are being used because you guys are still allowing people to use my dang card with the wrong security pin therefore they can gamble on freaking line if they get a hold of my phones with the wrong security code and you guys are still allowing this to happen thousands of dollars i‚Äôm in the process of finding somewhere else to run my money through because you guys don‚Äôt seem to care about my money my situation or what it‚Äôs doing to me that you‚Äôre allowing all this money to go running through my account knowing it‚Äôs not me Netspend get it together I‚Äôm a single mom and you‚Äôve cost me a lot of money and done nothing to help me your customer service is very rude I hate leaving one star reviews and if I could leave zero I would have unfortunately we have to put something put on the scale you‚Äôre a zero that‚Äôs just where you‚Äôve ended up you have done nothing to help me in as a single mother I have struggled repetitively as you guys continue to allow people to steal my money and you also steal my money I‚Äôve tried to be patient but I think it‚Äôs something my lawyers gonna have to look into enjoy your day I‚Äôm sorry for the bad review but get your crap together,5
I did not like NetSpend at all because‚Ä¶,I love Netspend but $20 overdraft fee every time u swipe your card is insane to me other that I love it,5
NetSpend does everything that they say‚Ä¶,Its a really good card,5
Not one thing per say just the all‚Ä¶,"I am totally impressed with Netspend services. Hasslefree, Quick, withdrawals deposits, excellent customer service.",5
Helpful,"Honestly, the best prepaid card available. They‚Äôre really reliable and I get paid 2 days early. I love that they keep me updated on any changes happening with my account and keep me posted on any upgrades I may be eligible for. They seem very customer service oriented and friendly :)",4
I like the app it‚Äôs just the monthly‚Ä¶,I have found that NetSpend has been very helpful when I want to add money to my card and paying my bills as well as placing orders online,3
A perfect deposit,Easy as pie! No problems.,5
Don't  like the fact that netspend‚Ä¶,They charge for extra stuff and don't tell you,1
great service,I tried several times to deposit two checks yesterday and I was unable to void the checks for them to continue processing because I had gone to work when I got home that evening I tried again and it rejected them,5
Being charged for a prepaid card can‚Äôt‚Ä¶,"I just love it....It helps me control spending, the small OD privilege helps when I run a little short,  they don't hound me to make deposits as if they understand and care about us the consumer in this pandemic time , I am just plain ole satisfied",1
Had a fairly good ecsperiens,I should not be required to pay a fee to deposit MY money on MY netspend card!!!!!,4
Was a good experience,Have been quick to notify me after purchasing items to confirm it was me.,5
NetSpend is ok.,Very easy to access and most ATM accepts the card,2
Great,"I like it except the ten a month charge. I want premier card, send me one! Otherwise I like the alerts since I am saving me money. Thanks",5
My last card expired with money still‚Ä¶,Bad information,1
I had trouble with social security‚Ä¶,The experience I have had with other banks are not very good so far I like this bank account,5
Very easy to set up,Hello I am happy,5
Everything has been good so far,"I love getting paid 2 days earlier than expected. Although I receive additional cards, the service is above superior.",5
It is my favorite Bank out of all banks‚Ä¶,I give netspend all the stars,5
It's the best and easy to use card on‚Ä¶bill payment,Absolutely awful! Everytime I use it you charge me a dollar or more! I had a lousy five bucks on there to use for gas that I spent hours earning on surveys because my family is homeless! You charged me almost two dollars! Awful just plain awful!,5
Excellent service,Great Card. Great Experience,5
My NetSpend Beginnings,It‚Äôs been great no problems,5
The charge for each use is high,Great reviews,3
I really appreciate you guys and the‚Ä¶,"I needed to add money to my card.  When I looked up the nearest location to me it just said HEB, so I didn't know if I was to use an ATM or what, but the HEB clerk was very helpful telling me that was done at her counter, which made it very easy.  Thank you for doing it that way.",5
Very quick and easy mobile check‚Ä¶,I don't think it's right that every time I make a purchase I'm charged 1.95$ I've never seen a card like this that charges anything on every purchase you place. I will be looking for a different card when I need one.,4
It was great & i likeit.,Horrible can‚Äôt believe I get charged for every transaction I do anywhere around 1.75 or 2 dollars to put in my pin? Not even adding the amount of purchase that I make at the places,5
Over draft protection,Ive used the Netspend services for years...left..but returned due to their quick services and customer friendly banking.,5
Chime is better,Great job keep up the good work. Have a nice day,1
I made a cash deposit on a Sunday‚Ä¶,Not an account supported by many traditional banks/entities. Immediately after first deposit a fee comes out. Will not be keeping this as an active financial institution.,1
Great Service.,Netspend is so amazing i truly like it i recommend to everyone 10/10 :),5
I was overcharged from ABC cleanup‚Ä¶,You charge a fee anytime I use the card.,1
You're great NetSpend üëç,There are many options out there as far as debit cards. Netspend is the garbage scum of the Grand ol golden dumpster of greed,5
Have had a great experience so,"Do not get this card , the customer service is horrible. I have been trying to dispute an error over $200 and have talked to atleast 4 different people over the phone and they will basically transfer me back to the main menu each time and do nothing about my dispute for my money back. These people are very sketchy.",5
good bank to have,I was depositing money on my card. Very easy and quick,5
Service was quick and easy,Easy to use i just wish i got the card that has the chip in it,4
Your agents need to be retrained‚Ä¶,"I truly Iove everything about my Netspend card. It did get stolen from me very recently with approximately $540. That was a big hit on myself & my family, so other than not knowing who to report the card stolen to & what to do now, I have zero complaints! Keep up the great work Netspend team!",2
I've had the card for 4 years now..and‚Ä¶,Well I just joined you and I was able to receive funds for myself I‚Äôm all the way in Cairo Egypt the downfall was I was only allowed to receive $500 in increments daily and I have needed more than that so it became a difficult process trying to send me the rest of the money my money monthly if you can receive your government benefits with a high high maximum why can‚Äôt you transfer any funds only $500 that makes no sense to me if the available amount is over 1000 why am I not allowed to withdraw or send only a 500 overall you are very quick and consistent it‚Äôs just no one can survive being sent $500,5
"NetSpend is easy to use,quick",Husband has had account for over 5 years Love It Great banking experience So I needed my own account and trust netspend,5
They were suppose to send me a new card‚Ä¶,I just buy. And reload this items.and register to activated..how long ready to use that card...please explain about that..so too long,1
Bad customer service,This is where I write this review. Look for words that match. LikeS. Eat. Xbox.,1

Customer service,I've had NetSpend for years! I trust them completely. And if I ever have an issue they fix it quick!;,2
Netspend is very useful and I wouldn‚Äôt‚Ä¶,DO NOT USE. This is the DUMBEST card ever,5
I get my payment early and on time,Need to be able to send and receive as much money we want as customers,5
Never had any trouble with their service,fast and curdious,5
Very good had them a while,Excellent card..i can use everywhere.and use to withdraw from the Atm,5
I got a refund from Comcast/Xfinity ‚Ä¶,Don't like being charged every time I run my card at a store.. it's unfair plus it's bad when you can only get 300 out a time instead of the whole at one time.. do better netspend.,5

I love Netspend but $20 overdraft fee‚Ä¶,You locked my account it been 3 days and still can't Access my funds,1
I really love the service,"The card is not cheap to use, I've had nothing but problems since day one. Such as being declined at an ATM or when I have a cart full of groceries at Walmart and for some reason this card thinks that a lot of my purchases are fraudulent or something because they decline them and I have them calling and proving who I am and everything else just to be able to use the card. It's my money and it's definitely not convenient to use this card.",5
Love,I have no complaints.Netspend is awesome!,5
I really love my car d,My card came last Friday soon,5

I tried several times to deposit two‚Ä¶,NetSpend is great. It's been easy to use and most of all everything is understandable I honestly understand it. I have recommended it to everyone close to me. Thank you NetSpend.,1
I just love it...,I've had the card for a long time and I've never had a problem they couldn't solve.,3
Fast customer response,Y'all giving serious problems on a account I opened in 2019 and I put you down on my taxes in 2019 y'all had my since Sept 8 when irs sent it to that account y'all told me on September 28th y'all had put my money on another card and it will be here and it would cost me 20 dollars you never did September the 30 talked to 4 people and still the run around I don't understand and then y'all giving small amounts instead of all my money I am not happy with net spend at all,5
Charge me to put my money on my card,You really charge me $1.95 for every single transaction no matter how big or small and whether it‚Äôs debit or credit. That‚Äôs terrible,3
To many penalties,Great app. Love it,2
Have been quick to notify me after‚Ä¶,Have had no problems all transactions have been correct,4
Very easy to access and most ATM‚Ä¶,overall very pleased with NetSpend .it was easy to obtain and my info is always there at.my fingertips. The only draw back I see so far might be the charges and pricing but I haven't looked over that as I should.,5
I like it except the ten a month‚Ä¶,I shouldn't be charged 3 dollars to put money on the card with a 500 limit and then charged another 5 dollars a month to use it AND gave to wait an hour for the money to be loaded in to the card. If I need 1000 on the card I'm charged 6 plus tax plus another 5. I get paid twice a month so 17 dollars a month just to use the card.,5
Everything,"I thought everything was great with net spend until I deposited $10 from my cash app and checked my balance to find that I was charged $5.99 for ""monthly fees"" . maybe I should've read the fine print closer but still, when I only had $10 and over half is now gone that's enough to make me not want to use netspend in the future",4
The experience I have had with other‚Ä¶,I don't appreciate being told that I have a balance of so much and we trusting my husband and I we go and do some purchases and guess what? When you have nothing which literally sent me into a negative I can't log into my account because even though I've provided my mobile phone on my account it stays there's no mobile phone on file? Therefore I cannot retrieve my code to reset my password because it gets sent to my email and it's just complicated I didn't think that it would be that complicated to reset a password or just give me a balance without carefully reading what's on screen,1
Blahhhhhhh,Netspend is great üëçüèæ they always have my money in my account.,5
I love getting paid 2 days earlier than‚Ä¶,I have had My Netspend card for a while and I can sleep knowing that nothing will happen to my money.  I have had other cards and had money withdrawn without my consent and never gave it back.  Endless calls and nothing.  Netspend sends me emails and all I have to do is respond to it and I haven't had a problem.,5
Good,Shouldn't have a 5.00 monthly charge don't even know what that's for.,5
Absolutely awful,Stop having all these monthly fees. People needs their $5.00,5
Direct deposit,Always very helpful when I have a problem,1
Great Card,"Netspend is a convenient, fast, hassle free way, for my family and me to send money.. Love it !!",5

Great experience.,The card came quick and then how The advertiser say you get your money two days earlier it's true my disability money came two days before the day I usually receive it so so far I'm about to go try to call it out I hadn't expect in the past and I always had a great experience in the past and that was some years ago so I know NetSpend has got more better,5

Need to be able to send and receive as‚Ä¶,I have not yet had any major issues with netspend. I do believe that sometimes the customer service can be a little inconsiderate and shows entitlement whenever certain situations occur and th hold specific guidelines they have to abide by. All in all I can say I am more satisfied then not.,1
fast and curtious,Net spend is very easy to use and has a lot of benefits.,4
Excellent card..i can use‚Ä¶,$31 in fees just for using the card didn‚Äôt even realize they changed it to were I was being charged every time I used my card when I called to fix it back how it has been for the last 4 years they told me there was nothing they could do about giving my money back,4
Don't like being charged every time I‚Ä¶,"I'm happy to report so far (I haven't used yet) that the chatbot folks was patient with me trying to transfer my small amounts from other cards to net spend. They were polite and promped . I will need to go to store and use accual card.I live back up top a mountain ,an don't get to store much. On line is what works best for me beings I don't drive ..Thank you Wendi yancey",5
My experience with netsped was bad,"Easy banking, direct deposits, and great 24/7 customer service.",1
Every experience I've had has been great,I chose Netspend because I‚Äôve used it in the past and trusted it. I‚Äôm using it now for the same reason because I trusted even though I did have one attempt on my card it was immediately squashed by the Netspend team my only problem is that it takes way too long to get a replacement card. I‚Äôm still waiting‚Ä¶,2
You locked my account it been 3 days‚Ä¶,I like using netspend but I don't like how much it cost monthly,5
The card is not cheap to use,If you report your card as fraudulent thru automatically turn off your card without telling you and then they send you a new card. I was stuck without access to my funds for 3 days.,1
I have no complaints.Netspend is‚Ä¶,Great card with a lot of benefits.  The mobile service is very thorough and easy to use.  The only problem I've discovered is the automated system when you have an issue or need to speak to someone is very difficult to use at best.  It has multiple levels that often do not read and send you to repeat information numerous times.  If you stay away from the automated system your great with this card!,1
That other card came last Friday,Good job on customer service!,5
NetSpend,"Horrible card to have it's a piece of work to reload, surcharges like 5 bucks and I remember why I stopped using it in the past, my money just goes missing everytime I use Uber I mysteriously get charged extra and it doesn't add up with the Uber receipts, this cards a scam and I thank God I didn't set up direct deposit and I'm worried I gave my social to this company",5
Good,"So far so good. I did have trouble ordering an item off of Facebook that I wanted ,the Bank would not let the charges go thur. I really do not understand why,could you please explain this to me, it was from Jarod Jewerly.  I would appreciate you checking on this for me.",5

"Good card,good app,good people",It been to many times I‚Äôve had to delete the Netspend app and reinstall it just so that it would actually load. Whatever cyber network or cellular tower you all uses for pickup where you left off is completely garbage and need looking into. Very inconvenience,4
Awesome,Money available a few days earlier on pay days. Easy phone access.,5
Hidden Fees,You're charging me to use my own money which I don't think is right. I will be finding me a new company that will not charge me a fee for every time I want to make a purchase,5

Great,I decided to use netspend for my direct deposit at work. The moment my paycheck hit the bank they took $5. I have not even had the account for a month. Now more fees are coming out! I will never use them again. I now use the Albert app. They never take fees without permission.,5
I am glad that I move to a banking‚Ä¶,"NetSpend fell to supervise my account and see the crazy activity that was happening on it from a criminal transfer in my money from cash app to NetSpend and pulling it right off over 2,800 worth of fraudulent activity was done on my car between September 9th and September 11th",5

Like it,I had no problem adding money nor paying with this card I recommend it to anyone thinking about using Netspend,1
Cool,I was recently a target of credit card fraud thieves. Using this allows me to add only the amount I want to spend and nothing more. Also there is a virtual card number you can change anytime for online shopping! Thanks!,5

I'm just 2nice,Without Netspend I wouldn't be able to pay bills online or shop. I also like that I always know how much money I have and what I've spent they send up dated emails each time my card is used. And it's not expensive to load.,5
Love netspend,I have used your bank for a prepaid card for many years and could not be more satisfied with your service. I just retired and attached my bank account to my Social Security account for my Monthly check and it was deposited right on time. Thank you.,5
To much time for transfers.,It's was not hard to do at all,5
Perfectly happy would recommend,I have never had a bad customer service experience with NetSpend. I been using their service for the past four years. They are already quick to take action and always clearly explained what needs to be done,4
I really enjoy using it's stress free,Because I've never seen a card be so damn expensive to use.  $1.50 every time I use it .,5
Better care,When I loading my funds onto the card I didn't receive my overdraft,5
Hard to understand the representative,Would give zero stars if it was an option. These people have a hold on my money still and decided to close my account but of course they can't send the money back to the card it was transferred from they have to send a check which I have yet to receive. Such a joke these ppl are,5
Good,The Netspend All Access card has everything in one card that I need. The only issue I've had with Netspend is that I keep receiving new unlinked cards without ordering. This is not helping the pollution.,4
Worst bank worst customer service reps‚Ä¶,I can appreciate that y'all's cards are accepted certain places and others aren't. I like that y'all have so many different locations to put money on the card. But I think y'all would get a lot more business if you only charged one of the fees...such as the monthly fee or the fee ere'time y deposit funds. But over all I like y'all so far. Thanks,5
Best Ever,"Paycheck has always been 2days early,and not one single problem, I recommend everyone getting one",1

Dispute,"Honest , Fast reliable services. I couldn't have made a better decision.",5
My a first and last choice.,"So far it has done pretty well. The first couple weeks some ATMs  refused the card,and that was frustrating, but seemed to be  straightened out since then.  Other than that it has and is hassle free. Completely works with you on overdraft option, and app is easy to navigate. Better than the physical bank I just left for, after seven years.",2
I haven‚Äôt received my card yet,I love the concept of my netspend account. I hate all the fees but can accept and understand most of them. The new one this time is the $5 a month fee. That's crazy I don't have large amounts of money on this card at a time or use it year round. Will I still be charged if there is no money on my card?,5
NetSpend is the best way to bank!,I RECEIVED A NEW CARD FOR MY DIRECT DEPOSIT.IT WAS COMPROMISED.I CALL AND RECEIVED A NEW CARD THE NEXT DAY.I WAS TRULY IMPRESSED üëç THANK YOU.,4

Excellent Service,"In the beginning hardly any fees to non. Now it's fees fees and more feesI've had netspend many times, It's not the same anymore. The fees are to much won't be adding any more money after this last drop.",5
I have been trying to do a card I have‚Ä¶,"I like my netspend card, but the first deposit I made, I put in just enough for my bill but it automatically took a monthly fee out which didn't leave me with enough to pay my bill. When I went to add money again, the minimum is $20 and had to pay the load fee again as well. Therefore I paid almost $20 just to pay my bill.",5
Agent was courteous and very helpful,The people who answer phones at NetSpend we're actually helpful&we're very respectful and nice...keep up the good work...I like how they explain things&are respectful...thank you...,2
$2 fee after every transaction,My experience with Netspend has been going well.Note: To keep others from using personal information to gain access to one's account such as passwords and pin numbers you will send an email link to the email that was provided to you by the account holder is a brilliant idea instead of a customer service rep. Providing that personal information to an unauthorized person.Good job and I give you a 5 star rating.,5
I appreciate you in my time of need,I activated my card with my email address and now I can't sign in,2
I decided to use netspend for my direct‚Ä¶,Very easy to use system for getting the information needed.,5

Too many fees,Terrible service an it happens to me  to  much,5

Paycheck did not post early as‚Ä¶,"it really sucks that when my money is deposited into my account , my payee sends me a direct at 7am i don't  recieve it until 9:30 pm .can this be changed to an earlier time? maybe, you could talk to meta bank or give me there contact information. i will gladly give 5 stars if this gets fixed",5

I have used your bank in the past for my automatic work deposit and now am using it for my monthly social security check.,You crooks charge $5 for a monthly fee to use the card.

I have never had a bad customer service‚Ä¶,"I got a Netspend card, for online purchases.  In order to reload it you have to purchase a reload card that is through a 3rd party website.  But I can't even create an account for the 3rd party website, so I can't even reload my card. When you Try to call the 3rd party customer service all you get is an automated system that you can't even talk to a live person. What a waste of my time and money. DO NOT bother getting this card its not worth the stress.",3

thanks for your help God Bless Netspend,"I love Netspend; however I called Tuesday trying to transfer funds from one account to another. Customer service was unable to process the transfer and out me in the automated queue. Which is pointless because I could have done that myself. I couldnt us the account with the funds due to them blocking it while they sent a new card. I called back and after explaining it was put back to the automated menu. I had to paypal my funds to a friend which cost me 30 dollars, then transfer that to my new card in paypal which cost more money. Netspend said they would express send my card and I would have it in three days. Its two days after that date and still no card.",5

This card is easy to use,Absolute disaster of an experience. Took my money and they claimed they never got it 2 times. Had to recover funds through my bank.,5
The fee charge every time I use my own‚Ä¶,I've used a few prepaid cards and they are all typically the same. You get charged for loading and also a monthly fee. I don't like the fact that merchandise can be purchased if you don't have funds on the card. Personally I would rather it declined at time of purchase if no funds are there. I had an overdraft for this reason and not a fan of overdrafts at all.,5
Disrespectful,I will never ever ever use Netspend again in my life!!!! They charge for everything!!! They have fees when you swipe your card they have fees when you check your balance they have fees for over the counter Purchases I‚Äôve never had a debit card where they charge for everything I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this card services to anybody!!! If I could I would give a negative 1star!!!,1

it really sucks that when my money is‚Ä¶,Netspend is the worst credit card/prepaid card company I have ever dealt with. The customer service practices are so over the top for the customer side of things. I accidentally typed a wrong number in an exp date and instantly it put a block on my card. But when I called with a concern and verified my account I was told that I would have to provide ID ss# and proof of residency. Never have I ever had to do this. Not to mention all their people had a foreign accent so naturally I'm not giving my ss #I do not recommend them to anyone.,1
It's been a pleasant experience except‚Ä¶,Real easy to use like the fact that I get paid two days before the rest of my co workers,3
I LOVE NET SPEND TOTALLY EASY TO USE ‚Ä¶,Dont like the fact that i get charge a fee everytime i swipe my card is insane,5
Good,I've only been with NetSpend a short time now but so far my experience has been great you guys are everything you said you would be you've done everything you said you would do and y'all are just awesome. Thank you,5

I love NetSpend it's great card never‚Ä¶,"I accidently changed my account to a NetSpend card that was not all access and was way overcharged for transaction fees with no warning but when I realized and transferred to an all access card they charged on my old card 995 for transaction fees when I closed the card. now I'm out of luck for my overdraft protection for this month because even though I've been a customer for 2 years it more looks as if I've opened a brand new account. none of this was explained to me properly,",5
Netspend is better than my bank,Activated the All-Access card and wished I had done it sooner. Countless benefits. Definitely recommended.,5
Charged me $5 the next day after‚Ä¶,Very good very nice friendly and quick,5
OKAY,I like the features,1
Outstanding work,Netspend is less restrictive to use than my local bank cards.  I have found it much quicker to receive my paycheck money also.,4
So far so good,"I was told I was being transferred to a supervisor, then 1 hour later No one picked up the line, then it was disconnected. I am NOT happy at all. Netspend took $15.00 of my money & will only refund me $4.00. They want to charge me $9.95 processsing when they already took $9.95 from my account. I would like the funds returned to my account ASAP.",5
I can never sign in on line   ..just woa‚Ä¶,Quick and not frustrating excellent experience,5
Activated my new card and refund back and excellents service.,I like it it's just I have to pay out of my pocket everytime I use my card.,2
I had received my direct deposit to my‚Ä¶,I don't get a notice when my card is being used.,5
You trap our money and refuse to‚Ä¶,It's ok it's just it takes so long to load the card especially when you are trying to pay a bill fast. Other than that it's a good card once your money hits. I wish they could spot you money but I know that's not an option.,5
You let me know right away what‚Ä¶,Professional and experience staff great attitude,1
It works,I really love Netspend it is very Easy to reload and purchase items as pay bills my experience with Netspend has been Incredible,5

Excellent service,Great service and help,5
Great company,Hi order a card from August 3 and them say 7 to 10 business day didn't get it hi pay for a 2 day shipping from the 10 of August and still didn't get it,5
Keeps me informed,I have a transaction on my account that is not mine that just made me miss paying a bill and now I have to figure out how to stop this pending transaction that you authorized on Ipsy or something and now I can't pay a bill that I'm supposed to pay and you guys had a transaction on my card and nobody wants to help fix this problem,5
Lost my whole check,"0 stars. Literally.  Unprofessional,  lack of care for their own clients. They are rude- several times I've been placed on hold and the line disconnected. Poor service.",5
Everything  Charge that is written in‚Ä¶,Im pleased with the debit card and services offered and provided to me,3
Great for bill pay and getting your pay‚Ä¶,"Professional , PERIOD, SHOULD BE MORE LIKE THE REPRESENTATIVE I SPOKE WITH, Thank-you so much for a pleasant experience! ! !",4
I couldn't completely comprehend the‚Ä¶,Netspend all-acess is a great debit card but as a customer I would like to see the fees a little lower bc of sometimes you be short and we have to deal with ATM fees as well as the charge for drawing money out and that's a problem we need a place where we don't get charged for ATM and surcharge bc it's out of network.,4
Someone used my card,I found it really hard to find a place in my area that would load more than $500 at a time very inconvenient,4
Saving the Day,"I like the app with NetSpend, the only thing is I wish we didn't have to pay that $5 monthly fee , and the $2.50 for atm fees , I ALSO WOULD LIKE A NETSPEND ATM BROUGHT TO OTHER STATES LIKE INDIANA, I've had good experience other then that...",5
So do do dip my app FB,It took a lot longer than expected to cash a simple 35.00 check. I also don't like the fee of 1.50 everytime I use my card that's a bit much in my opinion. I know everyone has to make money running any company isn't easy or free for anyone. But even with that in mind 1.50 per transaction plus being charged 3.00 for loading it becomes to much veryquickly. .,5
I was using go to bank and they failed‚Ä¶,I tried to cancel a transaction before it went through and I‚Äôve still haven‚Äôt gotten my refund back yet,5
Hope hope,"Have my card locked, and now I‚Äôm in the dark cause all money is on the card and couldn‚Äôt pay my utility bill!!!! Once my card is unlocked Netspend will never have to worry about me doing any banking with them anymore!ü§¨ Pissed to the max",5
Many foreign customer service reps that‚Ä¶,I got a lot to say but yea,5
I have had a great experience with‚Ä¶,Great Job to all partys involved recommended to a friend,4
i don't know the max day limit for‚Ä¶,Not a very economical prepaid card if you want to keep most of your hard earned money!!!,5
The lady who I spoke too was very nice‚Ä¶,Poor customer service! Asked to speak with supervisor and was told no then when I demanded one the representative told me there wasn't one available.,3
You all helped me when I needed the‚Ä¶,Stopped in circle K to reload my card. The lady said she never did it before and didn't think she could. So I went to speedway right next door and they had not heard of it either. Buy they went steps further and researched hoe to do it and helped me by loading my card,5
Satisfied with my order at McDonald's thank you,The service rep was the best I've worked with in a long time and far exceeded my expectations. The problem was partly my fault and tricky to correct but she is a whiz kid and made it seem easy.,5
So went to load money on my card.,My experience with NetSpend has been very pleasant,5
Reporting my card lost,Its easy safe and very convientient,2
I'm just trying it for the first time.,May review is a 5 rates awesome debit card,5
Check upload,All of your representatives refuse to transfer me to a supervisor. And I was charged for the pay as you go and the monthly plan BOTH in the same month. Absolutely ridiculous. And I was refused a refund for one of the monthly fees because my account is ‚Äúnew.‚Äù Terrible service. I probably won‚Äôt keep my account open because I was charged and was denied a refund. Also- I can‚Äôt even dispute charges on the app or the website.,5
Great time Enjoy the app is a very good time‚Ä¶,I always have a very great experience with Netspend! Highly recommend!!!,4
I am always satisfied with NetSpend,It‚Äôs a really good card to use it would be even better if it didn‚Äôt charge for each purchase,5
Very helpful,Check is on time,5
Cool,I don't like being charged a dollar every time I use the card when I have direct deposit,5
Money,I am getting sick and tired of you guys taking $2 to $2.50 out extra everytime I use my card. This was not discussed with me when I signed up for my card.,5
Easy to use and website is very helpful,"Too many fees attached. Activated card before reading documents. Fees are attached for every purchase, adding money to your account PLUS a monthly fee for having the card. Not sure how long I will be keeping this card.",1
Dispute,Good work over all well said and take-in care of.,5
Works just like it said just wish my‚Ä¶,They were not very helpful. I think I am talking to another country or someone that does not understand English very well.,5
NetSpend upgrade,"My account was locked for no justifiable reason.  All I did was try to use it for a $35 purchase.  Now I have to verify my identity again.  But now, they aren‚Äôt accepting my ID I initially used to sign up for the card.  So I‚Äôm unable to touch the hundreds of dollars I have in my account, which is locked for no reason, and my original documents to verify my identity are now being denied.",4

I just loved the card,NetSpend pretty much sucks as far as banks go. They r a rip off. So out of 50 bucks I can only get $43.00! NetSpend charges a ATM fee and so does the bank. And since NetSpend don't have many free ATMs your burnt. Yep burnt. While NetSpend keeps getting richer and richer charging us to get our own money out!,5
Everytime I use my card it's been good‚Ä¶,Everything is good so far I just don't like the fact that it cost me money to spend money,5
They didn‚Äôt answer my question‚Ä¶,Customer Service Rep. Quickly handled my situation it was completed in a timely fashion.,5
They helped me activate my new card and‚Ä¶,Great customer service would recommend netspend to everyone,5
Y'all did a great job keeping my‚Ä¶,I hate it! How y'all gonna charge me to transfer my own money to my own account?!,5

Its all good I'm just now trying it out‚Ä¶,You guys are great thank you for all you do.,5
I just was disappointed to learn that‚Ä¶,I dont like the fact that I pay to use my card.. So i will be withdrawing the remainder of my funds.. Also the fee is going up .25 which is ridiculous..,5
No problems and I like the security,"Okay thanks for asking me,but why do I have to get charged for using my card",4
Great customer service,It s the best thing ever happen,5
Okay,They are very secure in personal affairs and I never have one problem out of them!!! All I use is WU!,5
Easy money tranferes,I like the ease in putting money into my account by going to Walgreens. It‚Äôs also so easy to use any I like the text messages telling me what Ihave left.,3
Worst Customer Service,Anytime I have a question or dispute it's fixed then and there I've spoken with some polite people because I am a handful I know but we work together,4
You crooks charge $5 for a monthly fee‚Ä¶,"You guys are fine, other then your 20 dollar fee when you swipe after going negative, I didn‚Äôt see where it said that was a thing.",1
great app it has everything i need in a‚Ä¶,"I have been with netspend for 19 years never got upset but once they always  understand  the problem and fixed it very professional, and give you the right information",1
Don't bother getting this card,On Sept 7 I loaded money on my Netspend card and on Sept 8 I checked my balance and I found a unauthorized transaction for 99.95 I don't know who charged it because I didn't I did use my card for one transaction and it was used to order a Sling service I am the only one who uses the card and no one else has permission to use it only me the transaction was made through Walmart.com in Englewood Colorado I live in Las Vegas Nevada I will send a fax to you with all the details and reference number so I can receive my credit on my new card since the old one has been blocks please be advised my card was not stolen thank you for taking the steps to stop this person or persons from stealing my identity or others .,5
I HAVE BEEN TRYING  TO GET INTO MY‚Ä¶,Everything's good. Thanx,1
Good,I shouldn't be charged 1.50$ Everytime I use my card,5

Exceptional,Excellent service,4
Wonderful card to have.,Tried to send money from PayPal immediately and 2 times it got delayed 12 to 24 hours,5
Very happy with it all,"I have a hard time getting through to customer support. There is nowhere for me to dispute charges. Also, there is two pending charges from Q Link from a week ago and that money should not have been taken! So here it is a week later, my account shows zero funds and it should show a balance of $36.46, but again, I can't reach customer service to fix this, nor do you have anywhere for me to dispute! I'm actually not please with NetSpend",5
Money taking,It's easy an fast no hustle love NetSpend  always on everything everyday,5
Neither of the representative that i‚Ä¶,My card was compromised and a new card was issued and had to wait almost 2 weeks to get my money. Too long to get a replacement card to get my money.,1
They care but dont care.,Help me cashed my check,1
"Helpful & VERY ""On time""",Love it....get paid 2 days earlier which I love,3
Good work Netspend,Just need to be able to connect to cash app.Charge to much for ATM.,5

Great company,It was amazing no problem at all... card worked perfect had to run as credit I didn't know my pin #,1
Great card an I get my pay day early like they promise,I give 3 stars because there is a fee to use the card when making a purchase as well as a fee to deposit your check which means your spending more then you think.,5
Overdraft,Horrible fees they're charging me almost $10 to use a ATM on top of the $5 a month fee I'd give a negative rating if I could,5
It takes too long to get my money and‚Ä¶,I was unaware of the $1.95 fee every time I used my card as a debit! $6 was charged for the 3 transactions I did. I will no longer be using this card!!,5
Disputes are never in your favor after‚Ä¶,Terrible. Hard to understand representatives. Long phone wait. Customer service hasn't helped.,3
I've had great service very pleased.,I have not yet received my New Mexico state stimulus so I can't rate you,1

netspend,"I love my NetSpend card but I am a bit taken back by all the fees. I get charged $1.95 for using my card,regardless of where.",5
Good üòä review,It's just all around terrible plain and simple,5
It charge me 1.95 for every transaction‚Ä¶,"I was issued a refund by Walmart and NetSpend says they know nothing about it,ALSO I spent 22.81 at Walmart.com and NetSpend charged me 40.71 For the same,exact transaction. So in black and white it looks like NetSpend stole 16.00 from me,and I called and they say they have no idea..smh sounds a bit shady from a big businessi even called Walmart and received that a refund was issued to my card.  NetSpend said no such refund from Walmart existed",5
I don't like the minimum of 500 DLLs‚Ä¶,It‚Äôs bull y‚Äôall charge to much. Y‚Äôall overdraft my card last week for a $100. Don‚Äôt think I forgot. I‚Äôm not comfortable with this at all.  Y‚Äôall over charge me,1
Terrible company,"Everytime I call for help for my account, I get treated with the utmost professional care. Very polite and awesome attitudes. That's why I stay with y'all",4
I don't like the fact thT y charge‚Ä¶,You guys are always great when I need you,1
Customer service for very good,It was a pleasant interaction,3
Five stares in every area,My experience has been horrible I‚Äôve had representatives to deny me speaking with a supervisor and not even trying to fix the mistakes that they made after I had two payments returned for no reason because the money happened taken out of my account the representative did not care and did not try to assist and would not allow me to speak with the supervisor,4
ü¶ãüíô all done in less then 17 minutes‚Ä¶,Haven't really had to use customer service but what I have used has been ok,5
üòçüòçüòç,Love it love the card,5
Absolute disaster of an experience,Great service,5
I've used a few prepaid cards and they‚Ä¶,"This card is a joke! Prepaid cards should not need any personal info! It took me over 3 hours to get this activated! Needed to provide copies of documents, a security code etc. Never ever again!!!",1
I will never ever ever use Netspend‚Ä¶,NetSpend premier card is the best thing that's happened since sliced bread I don't have to go into Banks anymore and wait in lines. And now that I have the premier everything is just easier I can cash it on my phone my checks I can cash on my phone it's just a grade all around card and now they're giving me a free $20 wow that's awesome,2
I love my card  easy to load money you‚Ä¶,Absolutely horrible was on hold for over 45 minutes and was told my account was closed due to suspicious activity all because they didn't want to provide a refund they were wrong for. Would not suggest for anybody just go get an actual bank in your local town.,1
Good service,Love this card. Have not had any problems since I got.,5
Netspend is the worst credit‚Ä¶,I like using this card to make internet purchases. It‚Äôs easy and convenient to use and I don‚Äôt have to worry about using my bank card to make transactions.,5
Real easy to use like the fact that I‚Ä¶,I like netspend I prefer this card over all other card. I always get direct deposit and never get my money 2 days ahead of time if yall can't do it keep it real other then that I have no problems,1
Dont like the fact that i get charge a‚Ä¶,"Why tf did you double charge me?????The overdraft isn't by much, and I have still have to pay it plus how many times attempted ($20 extra mo dollars) ugggghhhhhh.I love my card and it's color I give y'all that.

I've only been with NetSpend a short‚Ä¶,They rushed  shipping the new card to me.  Experience is good they are professional.,1
ATM fees to much money to use card,I have used a few different prepaid cards but have not been satisfied. Netspend has always been great.,5
I love my netspend service.just wish m,Love the quick upload and easy app .I gave My card to my sis and I loaded the app for me so really helps when one of need quick cash .,2
Great experience,"Just an absoluted nightmare so far.  got a $50 card which expires 3/23.  Went to activate and says ""card expired.""  after arguing with CS for 30+ minutes they agree to send out a replcement card.  Ask for my SSN which was weird.  Receive new card, activate, $0 balance.  this company seems fraudulent at best.Edit:So the card was activated a little over a year after purchase.  Even though it wasn't activated, a fee started coming off the card a couple of months after purchase of $5/mo, that depleted it to zero.  Absolute rat-like behavior.  DO NOT use this company for gift cards.",4
morning just was concern about having‚Ä¶,Not happy 2 $ charge evertime you buy something online,5
I would like to see changes in the way‚Ä¶,Well I got this card for 2 reasons 1. I hated the card I had 2. I wanted to get paid a day earlier unfortunately my money doesn't get on my card until after I'm at work ( I work 2 nd shift ) so in reality I really don't get it earlier I wish my money would be on my card at least by lunch time,5
Add cash,It was easy going and simple.,1
Not so easy to load money on the card,I Got Paid Tried to Send My Money Lovers Cash App Card Got Flagged 634.82$ Pulled 320 Wayside Harrisburg Tried to Send The Rest to My Lovers Cash App Then Tried Pull Out Money Twice Estralias @ Harrisburg & Forrest Hill Can't Get to My Money to Pay My Lovers Portion of Rent,4
You guys are Cool Beans that I can cash‚Ä¶,Was not aware of the monthly fee until my money was short paying a bill. If I would have know that I would have never activated the card.,4
Cheating Clerk,"The people you have to talk to about our problems do not know what they're doing they are just not trained well enough or don't know what they learned when they were trained,but my experience wasn't good the last time.

I accidently changed my account to a‚Ä¶,"After spending a year and half fighting with direct express to get statement and even to update my contact information with a new address and phone number, it has relieved so much stress knowing that from this month on I have a customer service department available to me  that will support me, not hinder me, with my banking needs.",1
Satisfied.,I enjoy using NetSpend it's easier to pay my bills and it's better than pulling out cash it's safer really so I appreciate it,2
Good,The worst I haven‚Äôt received my check yet and I get paid on the 8th any 2 days early smh I should‚Äôve stayed with my bank,5
Satisfied,Too much $$$ to pull my own money. There are zero free ATM'S so you get double hit with high fees to retrieve your own money.,5
So much quicker and easier to use than my local bank debit cards.Netspend is less restrictive to use‚Ä¶,Easy to setup and use. Came thru in the clutch.,5
I was told I was being transferred to a‚Ä¶,Hey I like the overdraft protection it really helps,5

Unprofessional,At times your customer service workers are great helpful and understanding and other times they are the complete opposite just as sometimes you are quick at settling disputes and other issues and unfortunately more times your not,2

Poor customer service,Very good how I get my money two days faster than everyone else at work,3

Netspend never let me know that my‚Ä¶,I ordered nine pills and they gave me 27 pills and tried to send me an additional 27 pills and charged me $89 and that is not what I asked for and they said it was my fault so I do not want to deal with you guys no more I want my money back thank you!,5
4star,"I love netspend I use it to pay all my bills, do all my on line shopping , it easy today at many different locations,",4
God it‚Äôs goid,It's ok if u can't get an acct anywhere else. They charge you for every use of the card even though it's ur money. U get charged 1.50 everytime u decide to spend ur own money after a while that adds up. But they do keep watch for fraud and make sure u are taking care of. There's always someone to talk to and they do what they can do solve the issue.,4
Good experience,Best debt card ever,5
You guys are great thank you for all‚Ä¶,I enjoy the card but why do t your cards have chips in them yet?,5
Too many fees,I have never had any problems with NetSpend. I just went back. Last time my 5.00 monthly fee was waived? And I always got my pay direct deposit two days early. This time I am paying the monthly fee and I get paid one day before my payday.,5

WITHDRAWALS,"I really like using Netspend. I seldom have an issue but any time I do they will take care of it easily. It's the most reliable prepaid card out there.

I give up and tired of being ripped off being disabled and terminal I'll and get small disability check that barley makes my rent and they are taking advantage of me and tired of it and gonna change to some other deposits method...

NetSpend has been great so far.,I wish it was easier to get in touch with a representative.  I have questions and no one ever answers the phone.,1
NetSpend premier card is the best thing‚Ä¶,All is well. So far enjoyed the experience using NetSpend,5

Not happy 2 $ charge evertime you buy‚Ä¶,Love my card and account,1
Well I got this card for 2 reasons 1,I have always had good experiences when using NetSpend. I can deposit my checks no problem and the money post in minutes. Their only negative I have with NetSpend is their fees are kinda pricey. Which is one of the main reasons I transfer my check out right away when it's deposited. I don't want to be charged to use my own money.,1
Easy,Mastercard worked great. The visa one unfortunately never worked and won't activate it just frustrates and makes me waste my time calling multiple numbers and accessing different websites which makes me feel as if  I am being scammed or compromised my personal information all to use your product. But the Master card linked to my google paat and cash app. Perfectly.,4
I Got Paid Tried to Send My Money‚Ä¶,I love you guys thanks for the generous costumer service,5
Read the fine print,I love Netspend. I have had it for years.,1
Not good review.,"You guys was great I had several questions and the person that I spoke with answer all questions very professionally, knowledgeable, and in a timely manner thank you!",1
Thank you so much,"It‚Äôs cool. I get paid 2 days earlier, although it‚Äôs at night. I don‚Äôt like the $20 overdraft fee for every transaction. It‚Äôs refunded if their is a deposit within 24 hours after the overdraft transaction. I think that‚Äôs a bit absurd. Other than that though, it‚Äôs cool.",3
I enjoy using NetSpend easier to pay my bills and it's than having cash,quick fast and easy,5
The worst I haven‚Äôt received my check‚Ä¶,"Why don't people get payed for writing there experience. Why do people have degree in college but don't know anything, but how to act like they do.",4
Too much $$$ to pull my own money,I'm still waiting,1
You guys are  awesome,"I deposit $70 , $50 is nowhere to be found. And I know that I didn‚Äôt spend it. I am not happy with netspend right now. I am a Uber eats driver and I depend on my card very much. Guess I will have to use my bank debit card now.",3
Easy to setup and use,I'm very pleased with my decision of choosing netspend very convenient easy,5
Great,Took 4.50 from three unauthorized transactions that should be honored as they are rendering the monies that were taken,5
Dispute,NetSpend has helped me a lot especially when it's come to my bills and I have to go a little over MetaBank is always there to have my back :-) with NetSpend I got this! üëçü§© Elaine Hernandez,5
I love how easy and cost efficient it‚Ä¶,Can‚Äôt complain a honest company that they say they are,5
Great banking to use and very‚Ä¶,You tell me i can up grade then make me have to fix direct deposit cause it's under different account.  You can fix it by just changing card not the account,5
I love the app,What happens with my Money,5
Very fast to response,Love it and would recommend you card to everyone,5
My card got hacked every month and you‚Ä¶,"Fast deposit, I got paid two days earlier.",5
My experience with Netspend has been‚Ä¶,"The mobile check cashing was convenient, however, very expensive to cash. Also the fee to use my netspend card was expensive. Piper Tracy",3
Awesome,I got my check on time I think you guys do a very good job,5
The best credit card  Decision ever,what kind of sociopath charges $2 for every single transaction and $15 for transferring money to a card that doesnt charge $2 for every single transaction. that can't be legal.,5
Good,Worst experience I have ever had with a pre paid debit card and direct deposit. I am fixing to go somewhere else and set my direct deposit up with them because anyone else has got to be better than this sorry service I have received.,5
Everything has been ok aside from the‚Ä¶,Happy to be with Netspend All-access,4

Everything is fine,Doing a great üëç job thank you,5
I love NetSpend,"I've been very happy with my NetSpend card and service. I used my card to pay for a hotel room the other night. I thought I had pre loaded my card with enough money, but I hadn't.

My experience with netspend was‚Ä¶superb,I have been using netspend for years now. Like the convenience of direct deposit. Love getting the texts on my balance as well as purchases made. Would definitely recommend them to anyone needing a great card company.,4
Nobody really accepts prepaid anymore!!,"Still waiting on my new card, after they cancelled my last one due to suspicious activity. Net spend keeps my funds as far away from me as possible. That's security you can count on. I can even go online and check the amount of money I'm being denied access to. You people think of everything, aside from customer service and ethical business practices.",5
I was recently in a car accident and‚Ä¶,"I have been a NetSpend customer since 2013. I would never change, because it's the best thing ever. I'd give a 10 star review if I could. Now it is even better with the new All Access Account.",2
Learning to use a debit card,I think Netspend is very good. My Netspend Visa is accepted everywhere. I do wish that it had a chip or tap and pay for easier checkout at retailers. And I wish that the fees for transactions were less expensive. Or that there were a certain amount of free transactions per month.,5
Need to work on the overdraft,Thank you for your help Your Good Thank you again,5
Can talk to human beings  I need help,"I am learning more as I use netspend, just not to crazy about the fee when you deposit or take out money. Other the that O can work with.",4

Netspend is very convenient,"I really like I get to customize my card,and use it to load in a hurry at any gas station that's listed,only thing I would change is the charge fee for checking your account,or withdrawing fee when the ATM doesn't charge a fee.example:wawa",5

NetSpend problems,Everything is good. The only that I don't like that could be added is the tap or chip feature on the card.,3
How NetSpend is doing,Always great service . Everyone is very polite,1
The charges are ridiculous,The company was given my information without my knowledge or consent. They then refused to share which business gave said information. Now I am worried about identity theft. I am autistic so thought the card was a gift card or the government finally sending my covid relief package. This company is completely unethical.,5

All I know is that I am out 200 bucks and it took me over a month to make that money back to be able to turn my phone back on! So I'm writing this review in the hopes that I can be reimbursed the funds! Other then that 1 time issue, Net spend has been a great provider of help with my money!",5

Great card,I got charged fees for everything and it made me not want it any more!,5
I received a NetSpend card very easy to‚Ä¶,This is what I know I had a friend erroneous transaction on my account for $91.99 I distributed it it was $91.92 I just feel this they generated credit for $91.92 and before I could ever use it someone wanted her and took took $87.83 out of my credit and bought some supplies or something I have no idea what they bought or anything like that because I didn't do the transaction and then I found out on August 13th that I won't be getting the credit yet that there is is the second dispute for $87.83 which is using up my credit for credit for for debit I never did and now I got another debit for a $7.93 since I did not do $87.73 that I did not do and now I'm being penalized on August 26th right now issuing me a credit for $87.73 and because this I have no food in the house now for the weekend and no cat food for my cats cat food for my cats yes and now I don't know what to do because I don't have very my friend shirt I could actually owe me any money so I need a loan from the bank immediately of $87.73 and you can resolve into it however you need to because I did not do a transaction for $87.73 I didn't do a transaction for $91.92 either the only payments that I've been processing or under $10 on this card except for one that one is a $11.99 they're all under $10 and how can I do transaction for $90.87 or something like that $91.82 and also $87.73 I didn't do neither of those transactions and here I'm getting penalized by not having any food in the house when it says I'm going to take one working days while you're open on Saturdays and Sundays so that's a working days to me so we should get this result by tomorrow Saturday and I should be out out a whole bunch of money and no food in the house or anything like that or no cats food for the cats I need help I need help tomorrow tomorrow is a work day otherwise you won't be working there today at on Saturday,5
The extra fees on top of fees to‚Ä¶,You was a good service,5
Is Walmart s*** I want a price and it's‚Ä¶,Netspend is not a respectful company to oversee any kind of funds they will not honor their policy is your funds are stolen instead they will make it so complicated you give up so they don't have to honor what they promote I don't recommend Netspend to anyone who values their assets Do not use Netspend,2

They have been giving me the run around... I was told I would get a new one within 7-10 days. I called them again yesterday, and I'm told that they never applied for me to get a new card. They tell me it's on it's way, but aren't willing to give me an email certifying this is the case. I guarantee if I call them back, they won't have any history of our conversation... Trash.",5
Easy to use,"Very convenient! Never have an issue as my money is always there right away.And having a low monthly fee of only $5, rather than a fee with every use, the option to save, overdraft protection, and so much more! I just love it! Thank you!!!",5
It was the worst experience I've ever‚Ä¶,I have not gotten any text messages from you for my transactions. You also said there would not be a activation charge and I got charged $5.00. I am not satisfied with this.pamela eastep,5

Good service,"I like my netspend card but it‚Äôs hard to get a live person . So for this reason I will be leaving , and setting up my direct deposit with a local bank in a few months, I can never get 200$ in over draft fees . So I‚Äôll be a another customer to walk away dissatisfied. If this keeps happening. You go under .",5
Why don't people get payed for writing‚Ä¶,I like the card.,5
Still waiting,"I had a NetSpend checking account. While traveling at one point I somehow got locked out of my account . I called and answered all the security questions correctly and for some reason they told me they still could not unlock it . I tried calling multiple times again with no success . I decided to just wait a while , I recently remembered I had linked my venmo so I tried to transfer the funds (around $275)  to my venmo and Venmo informed me the NetSpend account was closed. So NetSpend closed my account without informing me and took my remaining balance . Thanks a lot for stealing . I also just emailed them and they told me they could help me if I sent them my account number which I did , they replied back ,sorry we can't help you but contact customer service . What the hell is wrong with your brain , don't you realize that is why I emailed because customer service couldn't resolve it ? It's time to stop letting these morons rob us . I've been robbed by so many companies these past two years and they act like it's my fault . People need to wake up and call it what it is , these people are aliens . It's time for us to stop letting them take everything from us .",5
I deposit $70,I've been dealing with NetSpend quite a while now and I'm very satisfied with you,1
I just love Netspend ‚ù§,I always thought Netspend was like a secondary throw me down type of card but it‚Äôs not that bad. In fact it‚Äôs better than top notch banks I had in the past such as Webster and TDBank. Netspend supplied me with benefits that those two previous banks didnt do for me. I give Netspend a lot of credit for taking care of their customers. Netspend made me a believer.,1
I'm very pleased with my decision of‚Ä¶,How much a limit for a day flash send transfer,5
Charging me for 3 transactions that I didn't authorize so my card was stopped because of fraud can't get a card right away and where you have changed my card and see the charges are reversed,"Never used Netspend before,  but things are going good so far.",5
"Meta Bank ,My Blessings",Didn't much care for the automated. Not real happy about all the fees when I use a atm.,5
Fees are ridiculous with this card,I‚Äôve been using Netspend for my banking needs since 2010. I‚Äôve loved my experience over the last 12 years!,5
Very happy so far,Does very well with informing.  Can't seem to be able to set up alerts,2

Better way,I use my NetSpend card to usually pay my bills but I had money left and it came in handy for me to make a purchase and was great but I just wish you wouldn't take $2.00 and something everytime I use it but I really like your card,5
File dispute,"I recently enrolled in your program overdrafts program, and got tricked. I had had the customer service that resolved an issue to how overdrafts work. To be clear for how to use my card if I overdraft during the month.The woman and or man said to its completion you have how to wait 24 hours for the service to start and meet $200 to $400 dollars a month period direct deposit, and pay $20 dollars when deposit amount of up to funding the account. But waiting period of up to 24 hours.",2

It's usually fast to respond to me ‚ò∫Ô∏è,"I received a card from Netspend in the mail but I honestly didn't even open the envelope for a few weeks. Then my personal credit union froze my debit card for some crazy reason and they promised to have a replacement in my hand within 10 days. It's been 2 months now and still  no card.

üòÅüíúüòé,"I can Not stomach your company ""hold"" music. I have to take migraine medication to make a call to NetSpend. Everytime I call, the least amount of being on hold, is ALWAYS an hour or more. When representatives don't know an answer, or what to do, they tell you to hold on, then, without telling you they put you back in que (on hold). I've been a customer for over 12-15yrs. I have No trouble with the Banking üè¶ itself. Just getting through the Customer service is a Nightmare!",5

Does very well with informing,There is really nothing else to add. My star review tells it like it is. My personal experience has been nothing but the best.

Cost too much to use the card at point‚Ä¶,I had the worst experience ever with netspend I wasn‚Äôt aware I had another account which was negative so netspend froze my active account an froze my entire paycheck all because I was negative $114.00 but I had $800 in my other account they froze my money for 5 days I had to take off of work 2 days and I had to beg people to let me borrow money because of what netspend did I will never recommend netspend to anyone and everyone I know that has netspend I‚Äôve been telling them what happen to me an there closing there accounts also why pay extra money for the all access account but when I call Customer service there is never a supervisor present to talk to,5
Thank you,"I called 3 or 4 times w/same issue. I was given a link to change password, but the link only led to a white page with NET SPEND at the top..nowhere to type ANYTHING!! I told them that. Then I clicked on ""the change password"" myself and it led to the same none helpful page. Two of the 3 that I talked to did not understand enough English to be trying to respond. I kept explaining the issue. I AM A COLLEG ENGLISH MAJOR so I know how to make a point. I was kind. They tried, but didn't really listen when I told them the problem was the link went nowhere to change password. I SPENT OVER 1 HR. TRYING TO GET HELP & ALMOST WENT TOJAIL BECAUSE I COULD NOT GET MONEY LOADED ON IT TO PAY FOR A CAB RIDE AFTER THE FACT! PLEASE CANCEL THIS ACCOUNT. I WILL ALSO WRITE AND ASK FOR YOU TO CANCEL THIS RELATIONSHIP. IT FAILED ME TOO MANY TIMES WITH EASE FOR OTHERS TO USE IT. i HAVE CHANGED SO MANY TIMES THAT THIS IS THE LAST STRAW! CANCEL THIS CARD.

Charges are too high otherwise it's a‚Ä¶,Too many fees and ATM  fees for withdrawal,5
I really enjoyed doing business with y'all,"When I needed help making a transfer I was not given proper help or options to do so. This caused me not only extreme embarrassment in front of the gentleman whom was selling me his motorcycle, it also caused me to have to stay out of town that night which also caused me to lose another whole entire day of getting ready for a business trip to Texas. In addition to that it also costed me over $100 in supplies that I had to buy because I did not plan on staying out of town nor did I bring anything with me to necessitate that to support myself or my dogs. Your customer service lied to me when I was told to call back that evening I did so and they were gone. Also I have not been receiving updates as far as transactions and now believing I had the money plenty of money in there I went to buy more supplies today and I was denied I am extremely unhappy with this service and I will not be recommending it to anyone ever.",4

Money was put on my card to pay a bill‚Ä¶,Had Netspend for about 5 or 6 years,5
NetSpend is a ripoff,Poor excuse for a card service. My refund was taken and I was sent a 88 dollar check that you all put in a minor's name as if a 15 yr old can cash a check. Give me money back,1
Not available,I nothing bad to say about Netspend both thumbs up,1
I have had Netspend for years and I‚Ä¶,"I absolutely love Netspend has great direct disposit, easy access to the app and to transfer funds or deposit a check!!",5
I was pleasantly surprised that your‚Ä¶,I love using NetSpend it's easy,5
Have had to wait more than 30 minutes‚Ä¶,NetSpend is terrible! They will let people rob you and have you go hungry and homeless rather than to help people or victims of and abusive relationship and domestic violence. They don't care about their customers or their financial health. They just want that money. A woman had a knife held to her throat and thousands taken from her and the let him get away with it. And she is now destatute and will be living in just as hostile environment as the one she braved herself through. You should be ashamed of yourselves.,5
I like netspend for its deposits and transfers,Do people do not get my money change to a different bank because you let somebody to take my money from me,2
Super Helpful,"i love using netspend. my experience with them has been great. i give them a five, with 5 being excellent.",5
You guys don't help at all,They are very helpful I needed my bill pay they got right on the job aint I‚Äôll never got my money they made sure I got it back with a new pin & code so happy,5

I love the card,No complaints except the app is slow on my phone,3
Charge everytime you use your card.,Netspend has been great to me. I had a dispute about a transaction I made when I purchased an item from one website and another one took the money from my account. I notified netspend and they took care of everything. And I had my money back to me in a week with a brand new card. Thanks netspend for doing the right thing and helping me out. I really appreciate you guys. Sincerely Shawn,5
thanks good people,I just got this card and within 2 days of me receiving it it was used and $224.00 was taken off of my card at Walmart. Well this makes me so mad. And then they might not give me the money back that was taken off my card.,1

Fast transaction.,I love netspend. It gave me my check 4 days early not 2 days like I was expecting. When you spend something from your account it sends an alert to your phone so it shows you how much you have left. It even has an option to open a savings account.,5
Horrible,It was good.  Thank you,5
Everything is good,I've just opened my account and so far I am happy with your services. I hope to have a long business relationship with you.,1
I no problem getting my money on time‚Ä¶,I was assessed a fee just for opening the account!,5
Perfecto,"Plain & simple, not exactly happy that each month get charged 5 dollars out of my account, so it's not that great.",5
Always locked...,All is good so far no problems smooth going and that's a good thing I wish you guys would do loans but it's all good,5
Reference. Great service easy for direct deposit and deposit,NetSpend keeps me pretty well informed and keeps me updated on my account they do very well and keep me well alert of what I have in my account,1
excellent service,"Somehow I was charged $1 for a transfer I never initiated or knew about. Then got billed more than double for a subscription (due to the $1.50 fee). My fault because I didn't cancel. I didn't remember that I had at one point given them this card. There's just a lot more fees with NetSpend than most, if not all other prepaid debit cards.",5
good and easy to use,"When I signed up for Net Spend and received my card in the mail. I read the information and I understood it as I would not get charged every time, I used my card, and I would have to pay a monthly fee of $5.95. I am looking into getting another card through another company that doesn't charge me every time I use my card and where I can earn cash back after I spend a certain amount. That is what I understood this card to be. I also signed up for getting a text message to my phone with my balance each time I used my card and I have never received one text message to my phone. I have to call everytime to get my balance.",5
It takes your money,The overdraft amount is ridiculous.   Then turn round an have to pay a monthly fee . Wether its ur last 5 bucks . They make sure they get paid. This card is more about greed then anything anymore,5
First I would like to Thank you for the‚Ä¶,I'm berry happy I have. this new member on Metabank. I really appreciate it and the customer representative are nice when I need some explanation thanks!,5
I received my pay 2 days earlier,Excellent in everyway!  So happy for the convenience!,1

Underated,It charges 2 dollars every time I use my card,5
Too much unnecessary and hidden charges.,Some has stolen my card info and my all my money,5
My name is Dewitt Lockettj I will like‚Ä¶,I HAVE NEVER SEEN A Bank who hates to  provision credit your funds when you have been the victim of theft or identity fraud.,1
I have money getting transferred into‚Ä¶,"not very good as an everyday debit card, you spend a dollar they charge you a dollar fifty, but, if you have a 500 deposit that charge goes away. other than that it seems to be ok",5
NetSpend is awesome,For those who don't have a Bank Account....this is for you.  Each card comes with  an account number and routing number..  Its easy to load the fee is not ridiculously high and  you can use the card pretty much anywhere.  My only comment otherwise is that the card has a limit of $500.00.  i'd like to see that up to $1000.00.  I use my cards for my business...taxes etc.,1
It's been a great service for me so for.,Closed my account after getting my first deposit without any knowledge. Now I have to wait for a paper check in the mail.,5
You dont want my review.,"I got a new job and I needed a place to direct deposit. Thank you so much for accepting my funds available before Friday. It's been a tough year being unemployed and I have a lot of catching up to do.Regards,Anana",5

I love the card,I was told I could overdraft. I had an emergency and I needed money that wen my direct deposit came in u would be able to deduct it and couldn't.  I'm not very satisfied about this,5

I truly like the fact that with this‚Ä¶,"I just don‚Äôt like that every time I go to use the card,you take 1.95 out and it‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt spend my own money.",5
Great customer service easy to use‚Ä¶,"You guys charge a fee for everything and no atms are free. I've gone to Walmart, CVS, Walgreens and everyone charges a fee plus whatever NetSpend charges.",5
They are easy to use and their fees are‚Ä¶,I love NetSpend but the only thing a have a problem with is that I can't overdraft with an ATM only at a store or gas station.,5
My overall experience was pleasant and‚Ä¶,You blocked my card when I said not to it had money on it that I owed a bill to.he blocked my card any way and hung up now I'm just waiting on a new card I guess. Because  no one said what happened  next. Totally upset and want my money,5
I like that I get paid two days earlier‚Ä¶,So far so good! Very efficient & happy,5
Net spend has been awesome,Great card early deposit and great customer care,5
Could do with no transaction fees,I like getting notifications for every transaction; it helps me keep track of my account.,5
Dissapointed in emergency.,I hate you get charged to use a card with ur money on it every transaction or a monthly fee to get your money off. That‚Äôs weird to me. I won‚Äôt be using this card anymore,4
netspend,It is easy to load money into the card and also easy to use on my online purchases.,4

I'm not satisfied at all with the 5‚Ä¶,I can't pull more then 300 dollars on one transaction and it's leading me too to many fees. I got the card because before I could at least pull 1000 off on transaction but now I can't. I like the card but the fees are making me too reconsider.,5
I'm not satisfied at all with the 5‚Ä¶,I LOVE IT. Y'all should try it.,1
I love my NetSpend all access card,"Won't let me use app,I've changed my password 3 times and it still won't let me on the app",1

So far so good,I love Netspend. It has been a blessing to me.  Easy to set up and use.,5

Answered something OTHER than what I‚Ä¶,Services pretty good it's just a certain employees I had issues with other than that it's a pretty good service I can't lie just basically felt they were agitating me for some other reason besides what was at hand as far as the work itself,5
Fantastic,"Once my job post my money, NetSpend doesn't post it until 4 hours after my job post it thru direct deposit.",1

5 stars,"After multiple attempts to transfer funds, it happened! The last woman I conversed with actually paid attention in training class!!! Listening to several prompts and selections is very unsettling when you need to talk live with someone. Ask the girls to address men as Mr. and not Sir. The Queen didn't dub me a knighthood.",5
Honestly I've been with Netspend for‚Ä¶,"I love Netspend! So easy to load money, keeps me informed of any transaction and texting my balance right after. The added security really puts my mind at ease.",5
I love netspend it is accurate with‚Ä¶,Frustrating talking to representatives and they didn‚Äôt make to much sense.,5

I have no problems with net spend bee‚Ä¶,I think it's a great service the only issue I have is the cost is a little high to use my money,5
Easy set up no Hassel or hidden fees,If I could give you 0 stars I would. I was lied to by at least 10 agents and a supervisor on a recorded line btw,5
Unhappy customer!,"I don't like it. I reached the guidelines to overdraft. I overdrafted on just a little and they charge you 20 each time and then won't let you over draft anymore. Basically they are stealing money from us, not the other way around",5
A Ex Girlfriend took 400$ out my‚Ä¶,I have enjoy Banking with Metabank via Netspend. I love Netspend get paid two days early feature and real time notifications with Balance information. Thank you Net spend for being there.,1

Transfer money,I love the company.,4
I have been using netspend for 3 years‚Ä¶,Love the way the card works but a $1.50 for every transaction is a little high,5
Speaking to a person,My card wouldn't work on a certain website. I called and they told me to link it to my email and it would then work. So I did what they said and card still won't work for what I needed it for. I don't like being lied to and feel as if they manipulated me into linking my email just so they could constantly email me useless things.,5
service.,Ggccggfgfffgggh huh.,5
I havnt used my card a long time but for the few days I did I enjoyed it,I¬¥m new using netspend! but we doing good.,5
I don't have nothing bad to say about‚Ä¶the best that ever did it,Many times my NetSpend doesn't work to pay for things and it gets denied declined I don't understand when there's cash in there why I can't buy something or use my card to pay for it online without having to get it pre-approved I was under the understanding by verifying my identity that I was able to get cash with my card out of it if I needed to that's not possible otherwise I'm happy,5
An app on my phone took $110 extra than the $15 that I specified.,"NetSpend stole all my money. I couldn't pay my rent and got evicted. They said I was dead, and closed my account. I'm still waiting to get my money back. NetSpend ruined my life.",4
Customer service was kind,"The netspen checking account option, is amazing, thank you so much netspend, God bless.",5
Great service,It‚Äôs easy to use and easy for me to login to look at my account and track my spending. I like the alerts I get each time the account has been used.,5
Awesome and I loved that get my money‚Ä¶,"I am pleased with the service, through the Mobil app, the simplicity of activation for my NetSpend card has been a big convenience for me since ,I don't have a bank account It's very time consuming to try to cash my checks it's also allowed me to continue my online account to receive money as well.Great customer service as I've used it it's been just what I expected! So far so good.",5
I still haven't received my card with‚Ä¶,"Horrible is an understatement, charges for everything! Even a dollar fee for a decline don't waste your money using this card for any reason....",5
Excellent card to use.,Card is good but you add an extra 1.95 for spending.hmm if a purchase was declined  I need a notice. People collect as you give  services.,1
I have nothing but praises for‚Ä¶,"Why ??? No one explain about over draft fees,10 dollars is ok , going over the limit I don‚Äôt like",5
Dispute,"Attempted to use check capture within app, check wasn't cashed after contacting customer service I was instructed to contact Eagle, the company which processes these transactions. The representative I spoke to refused to let me speak to Supervisor then hung up on me. When I am able to replace Netspend cards with different company I will be doing that.",5
Crappy experience and the fees are‚Ä¶,I'm very well satisfied with NetSpend thank you,5
Best choice ever!,Perfect for what I need in life,5
It was a pleasant experience went‚Ä¶,You did a great job Thank you,5
Very convenient,I have no problems with netspend so far. Everything is good.,5
Y'all are fast and reliable,"I had the misfortune of being hacked threw Google,Fortunately Net Spend was there to help me recover my account,but at the same time we're very uncompassionate toward my situation at hand.Even though NetSpend goes threw with you when you open your account a series of security questions that you and only you know the answered to I was told that those questions which were very personal,some of which I had to think really hard to remember,weren't acceptable to identify who I am! We all go threw this at one time or another, your ID expires and you end up with a id that is expired,but still a picture of yourself no matter weather it's current or not ""plenty of proof of who you are"" well we were right in the middle of the Covid19 outbreak  and I was told to stay at home my id could wait. I had my money locked down with no way to support myself because my bank would not bend on my id situation I ended up loosing my home my electric, my truck,ect. All because Net Spend would not take into consideration I couldn't renew my id because of the pandemic.i ended up closing the account and because my money was deposited into my account by the government,that's where they sent it even though it was my money which I earned threw out my lifetime NetSpend decided they would decide where and when we my money would be returned to I'm sorry I thought it was my account and it should have been returned to me not uncle Sam.at last after being told it would take up to twenty days to send my money back to uncle Sam I agreed so they would hurry up and close my account and I could have control once again if my life and not NetSpend. I'm still waiting for my money to be returned to me I hope that they will I am just not too sure if I'll get it back or not I guess what I learned from all of this is  it may be your money,but you definitely don't have any control over it if they choose for you to realize that fact.",4
Great people n service,Fast and easy to use and activate,5
Lost money,A app stole 30.00 from my account.only 10.00 was replaced but I need the remaining 20.00,5
I like the experience I'm getting it's‚Ä¶,Most of the representatives have been fast and efficient. Your automatic system however is a total failure. I end up hanging up and calling back to speak to someone. That ends up taking more time.,5
Best service around!!!,Terrible service. My card got stolen so I disputed  transactions as anybody would.  Then you take my money and ban .e from netspend services. You all are terrible people.,5
Very good,"Very  helpful,the only thing  is? I thought  we had set up a savings.",5
Don‚Äôt like the fees when using the card,Thank you so much to accept me to be customer,5
I've had a great experience with using‚Ä¶,I've been very disappointed appointed this time around I have been up graded to the premier but have not gotten my card and just a bunch of problems,3
Overdrew my account,I like NetSpend. Easy and convenient. Just wish they had a refresh button on their app.,5
Love this,You are on time and keep me update on my card always,1

Terrible customer service,Horrible customer service and rude kept calling me MISS when I‚Äôm a MALE!!!! Stole my money $340 I can‚Äôt access my account I chose this because my wallet was stolen and now my only cash is stolen by a bank and won‚Äôt unlock my account. I sent in documents that I could to help verify and said my account would be reviewed after 6 business hours and still nothing I access to my account so once I get my money I‚Äôll never ever have anything to do with this branch again and I‚Äôll be making contact with the better business bureaus and news stations I wouldn‚Äôt even rate a one star,5

Now let's see if the bank can be so forgiving!?",5

MUCH MORE THAN I EXPECTED,I had a horrible experience never wanna get this company again they charge you for everything and take your money,5
In the beginning I had problems‚Ä¶,Recently I switched jobs to a  job that pay every two weeks. Net spend has not been getting me paid early.  This sucks !

Awesomeness,The fees per using the card are insane for a card that's not even chiped. Was going to set up my direct deposit to this but now am not sure,5
It's a very handy reliable service,"I was happy when I first received my NetSpend card and opted for direct deposit and was excited to have my paycheck a day prior to the actual pay date.  However, I had a hard time withdrawing the funds. I needed to withdraw a large amount to pay my rent and it was like going  on an adventure.  You are allowed to withdraw at the ATM up to $326 (up to six) per  day with a fee of over $2.95 per transaction.  Finally, someone mentioned Walmart and advised that Walmart allows NetSpend customers to withdraw up to $1000 per day and the Money Center.  I do not have Walmart close by -- so I had to make two trips to get the total funds need.",5
I LOVE THE FACT THAT MY OLDEST SON TOLD‚Ä¶,Great card company love the direct deposit feature of getting paid 2 days early,5
I‚Äôve been with Netspend all access for‚Ä¶,"Until now, I haven't received the paycheck from the last week's work, and I've been expecting that already. I received the first paycheck, since I came to this NetSpend Western Union NetSpend, but late,not the expected ""two days early"" time of arrival of direct deposit check, but the second one, until now, is never received. I'm going to use that to pay the bill.",5
Very Prompt,"Great service.  I am able to use this card in exchange for a bank account,  especially since I'm about to move.",5
Get my paycheck a day early,I am very happy with Netspend I have been with them several years no complaints just recently updated to All access account few more benefits. Would highly recommend.,5
EVER7YTHING IS GOOD WITH NETSPEND,"I have always loved my Netspend card until recently. My Account was hacked in July with 8 unauthorized transactions. I notified them for a dispute. I had to get a new card. The next day after activating new card, my Union deposit and transferred balance was hacked leaving with $0. I am a 75 year old senior on Social Security an a small Union pension. I have called many times to get a refund. The same day I was on hold a total of 5 hours. Always an hour on hold. I have called many time. Twice I was hung up by the representive. I called yesterday and was told that my account had been closed. No word about refund! This is 100% bank fraud. Now, I have no money to buy medicines that keeps me alive.",5

Great online banking,Netspend unfairly charges for EVERY CARD USE!! I  HAD $10 ON MY CARD AND TRIED TO PURCHASE AN ITEM FOR $8.29 AND IT WAS DECLINED!

Good card to have.,The customer people were very efficient whencalled about an issue although there is an dispute being processed but that's besides the point in general every time I've contacted then directly they have helped me solve any issue I was having,5
What a joke netspend is they canceled my card,"Can't complain, is a great prepaid card",5
I really like netspend except for the‚Ä¶,I just started getting direct deposit to my netspend account from work at Amazon.  It couldn't be more simple to do everything from bills to transfers to ATM withdrawals and everything in between from one spot.  The same spot where I receive my paycheck.  I love the convenience and ive been a Netspend customer for over a decade and have had nothing but success with it. The cell phone app is as good if not better than any bank I've seen so far.  I feel well covered at Netspend.,1

Net spend is a good card,My net spend card withdrew money from my account without paying my bills. At this month I am very disappointed with NetSpend services. I feel I am entitled to a refund for your company taking money away from my account. Would not recommend your services to no one. Give me my money back,1
Had netspend years ago,Everything is working out but some creditors don't take care for payment which I did not know.But it's worked out so far.Thank for assisting in different way to shop and pay bills. Rate company 1out 5 get 5.,5

Compliment,"So, far, so good. But, I do have questions aboutmy PayPal Card, (which is also NET SPEND), see, I like playing ""Money games"", like Bingo, Coin pusher or Solitaire games, that might payout LOTSA cash. And if they do, I want to put my winnings on my PayPal card. It appears that PayPal is rejecting deposits. I don't know why. Would y'all please let me know if something is being done wrong? I tried asking customer service, and finally realized I couldn't get a straight answer. And gave up. Other than this, we'll see how it goes.",1
I really love the company,"So far so good‚Ä¶. Easy does it ,,,, No problems. Thanks Netspend.",5
Totally disappointed cause you can't‚Ä¶,I'm absolutely satisfied with my NetSpend prepaid account... Five dollars a month service fee is the only charge I received from using my card... No other charges!!! People that's 5 stars... For real,5

Excellent,I was not aware that I was going to get charge everytime I check my balance on the atm? I understand well aware of it that when you withdraw from the atm that I would get charge which is Fine but a balance inquiry? Without a heads up? Kind of lost my interest on banking with netspend,1
This msg   the longest invisible positive review fora √ßompany or app development.,I have tried several times to talk to netspend regarding my account n nobody will answer my questions I'm very unhappy üôÅ,5
The person I talked to about my card‚Ä¶,I like NetSpend cause I don't have to sign up at a bank n with my credit I can't get a bank but NetSpend gives me a second chance to have a bank account to pay bills are buy stuff at the store the reason why I didn't give it 5 stars cause it could use a cash bonus for signing up but other than that I like NetSpend,5
I was setting up direct deposit and had‚Ä¶,Bc I winded up being charged extra and everything slipped the card than lost card lost out on another money that yall took. So switched back to my bank,5

I‚Äôve been with Netspend for 7 years or‚Ä¶,Im very happy with the service. It has been very satisfing experience working with this service.,2
This is the best kind of card helps out‚Ä¶,"Everything time I talk to someone, everyone says something different. The rep's can barely speak and understand English. The rep's get what you are asking for incorrectly several times. No Free ATM's. Majority of the prepaid card companies have free ATM's.",5
I love the new updates keep it up guys‚Ä¶,Great card happy to hsve it,5
"Iv,e been with netspend along time,many‚Ä¶",The experience was nice and helpful overall the card is excepted most places and your money comes on the card shortly after loading which has many locations to do that.,5

I never had problems until I got my new‚Ä¶,"Your don't communicate with the customers if there's something wrong with they're account. Your have people on hold for 25,30, or sometime 35 minutes.

NetSpend is great !,It comes in handy to pay my credit card off I like the ATM use,1
Wonderful,Enjoyable music on phone line during wait time. Sad to see NetSpend and MetaBank was not willing to work with me on any fees on any level under any circumstance despite me being a loyal customer. I stuck by my open mindedness and willingness throughout all of it though.,5
Awesome üòé,Can't get no better always dependable.,5
Little effort,I am looking forward to doing business with your bank. And thank you for the opportunity to have an open account. Now all I need is to get my direct deposits filed with you. Thank you.,5

Cozy Introduction,Always friendly and helpful,3
Fees are a bit much but it works,I really do love this Bank and everything that they did for me I truly represent this bank and will tell anybody that you NetSpend,5
Never had a problem with them,it's good to save money when I don't want to spend that a good way to hide it,5
Great and easy,Trash card charged me 56$ in fees the first month never use NetSpend,5
Appreciate them for constantly updating there system with new benefits,NetSpend do awesome job they help you with problem with your card they alert you when suspicious going on with your card they do they job no complain here thank you NetSpend.,5
Y'all should be out of business,"there is no free atm,or i wouldn't have got direct deposit.",4
I nothing bad to say about Netspend‚Ä¶,Never got my 20 dollar bonus. I did everything that was complied.,1
Very very good,My 1st time using Netspend  went very well & this card helped me a lot,5
Great prepaid card,My experience with Netspend has been miserable. I got this card for the express purpose of using it online and now that I have online issues Netspend is telling me that I can‚Äôt do anything about it. It‚Äôs very cumbersome to load I don‚Äôt understand why I can‚Äôt load it from another credit card and also when I call your helpdesk it usually takes about 20 minutes to get someone to answer the phone. I doubt I will reload the card and use it again the experience has been horrible,5
I love using NetSpend,they take every little bit of money that you have on your card crooks I'm done.,5
I have been having great experience,Great card for direct deposit it eliminates the need for a bank,5

Good card love it use it everywhere,Amazing banking services,5
Somehow I was charged $1 for a transfer‚Ä¶,Helpful when my card bank card got restricted. It is  a good backup. Also useful for paying for paying gaming stuff online.,5

The overdraft amount is ridiculous,Everything is ok ‚ò∫Ô∏è. I've enjoyed the pleasure. Thanks üòä,3
I'm berry happy I have,Netspend has been a life savor when everything you do or buy is electronically. I don't like fooling with banks and all of their hidden fees. I like to spend my the money I make and not the banks with fees. Netspend has one fee and only one. Thank you Netspend!!!,1
Excellent in everyway,"I have had nothing but problems with my debit card... I recently ordered a new card because my active one no longer is swiping correct so i ordered a replacement, well when i activated it, it opened up a new account, i only want a new card with my existing account.",5
Great service,It‚Äôs nice working with ya when I need to keep things going.,5
Awesome,NetSpend is a good card for me,5
Over charge,They Charge to many fees even to take put the money at the ATM is almost 7 dollars way to much is a no to me.,5
Good customer service,You have been a great company to work with,1
Some has stolen my card info and my all‚Ä¶,Seems ok so far haven't had it for very long,5
No Good on dispute,Because I have to send in documents when my card is bloked I've never had to do this before and I've been a loyal netspend customer for over 5 years I should be able to just give all verification of identity over phone,1
not very good as an everyday debit‚Ä¶,Good service,1
"Why you should use Netspend,.",I don't like the ATM fees it's 2.95 fee for NetSpend and 3.00 at US Bank for the one transaction. And then there's a monthly fee!,4
Closed my account after getting my‚Ä¶,Netspend to me is very helpful and convenient as possible. You understand everything. Disputes are easy etc. I just love it.,5
On time and very reliable,Cards only work half the time and allow fast food rest to charge card like credit card to pull more. Also can't use everything in your account only what Netspend let's you,1
I got a new job and I needed a place to‚Ä¶,Thanks MAKING life easy..........,4
It good,Wonderful great fantastic fabulous good nice ok,5
Paycheck come two days earlier why‚Ä¶,I love you guys you make it so easy for me to do banking and to do my mobile deposits and direct deposits with no hassle. Thanks for everything you guys do.,5
It was a overall great experience,"The entire reason I used NetSpend was to have an online virtual card, but my orders won't go through. Payments are declined, and my profile says it's pending.  What's the point?I called customer support and the issue was never resolved",5
I love NetSpend 5 üåü,No problems with loading or purchases.,5
Took out monthly Fee I had it for 4‚Ä¶,I have had very good service using my card . If they think it's fraud charges they will contact you before your money is taken off. I really appreciate that. So that what I call good service.,5
I've been waiting on a replacement card‚Ä¶,I refuse to pay a $5 maintenance fee. For what? To keep you afloat?,1
I was told I could overdraft,"Customer service is great, easy to load and transfer money",1
Doordash and Walmart both doesn‚Äôt‚Ä¶,"I like that I chose to bank with NetSpend. They are kind generous and right on time with the Direct Deposit. No waiting, No hassle üíûüíûüíû‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è",1
I have had no problems with my card and‚Ä¶,It charges me every time I use it. So what Bank is free with this card?This card Charging me at my own ATM,1
I like how easy the app works,No known issues as of yet.,5
Took too much out of an initial purchase so when I went to use it again it declined. Very embarrassing and I will probably refrain from using the card in the future and just use my Cash App card.,"I don't receive my check 2 days. I wish this feature was updated! Other, that every thing is wonderful!",5
I am broke as fuc you bitc,I don't really like the five dollar fee every month.,2
It's the best,I love that I get paid earlier with netspend,1
They are the best,Net spend is a great card for me you fraud alert which has happened to me they closed my account to make sure that it is safe and I was sent another card in 10 days which was great about it netspend is a great to have on hand,5
You charge 5 dollars a month witch‚Ä¶,quality of service is adequate but the fees are steep. The majority of users need to use netspend because they cannot afford to hold a credit card or have enough credit to do so. so why should you take advantage of them with drastically high fees.,5
I have no problem with NetSpend,You all do good work on help people need help with there money,2
I like it but not all the fees that go‚Ä¶,Very helpful,5
I bjus don‚Äôt like that every time I go‚Ä¶,Got my direct deposit taken care of fast and easy.,5
You guys charge a fee for everything‚Ä¶,Answered all my questions and he'll me out thanks,2

You blocked my card when I said not to‚Ä¶,Have had issues trying to transfer money and even getting in contact with Customer Service and that being of no help either I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs made that way or I‚Äôve tried it multiple times and have failed,5
So far so good,I don‚Äôt like that this acct is more so like a prepaid than a credit card. I don‚Äôt like being charged monthly. I don‚Äôt like being charged a fee just to transfer MY funds to myself,1
Get charged to much just to use it,Tried using the the feature for loading a check to my account and because I live in NY did not allow me to use that feature,5
Great card early deposit and great‚Ä¶,I love banking through Netspend. Its fair an useful,3
Excellent help,"So, I get charged a $1.95 everytime I use my card online, in which in my case is a lot. Very disappointed! I filed a dispute and haven't heard anything from them. In my opinion not worth having if you shop online a lot.Plus a $5 fee to cash a check and a $3.95 fee to load funds.",4
I love netspend,I love it! One thing that does bother me though is the fact that it seems to have problems hooking up to PayPal.,5
I like getting notifications‚Ä¶,I need to add a second card to my account but there's nowhere that shows you can add,5
Hate it,Charged me a 20 fee for a purchase i made when i had funds that was still pending. I overdrafted from a diff purchase and charged me 2 fees,5
Easy to load and use.,I‚Äôve been with netspend since 2008 I‚Äôve In joyed  your service‚Äôs for the many yrs,1
It's ok,I love my card I use it all the time,5
Fees are crazy but it‚Äôs a good and‚Ä¶,Just glad that setting up and using netspend was so seamless and glad to be a user.,5
I highly recommend this pre-pay card.,NetSpend it's okay but the only thing I got to say is that you're supposed to get your check a day or too early and I don't I get it on the same day anyway so I'll be looking forward to get it 2 days early I get it on Thursday the same day I get paid anyway,5
Awesome!!!!,Has taken care of my financial needs during a time of transition. Would recommend to anyone,5
I love Netspend,I don‚Äôt even have a netspend account. I keep getting messages about it & it‚Äôs not even my name. I can‚Äôt get anyone to email me back about it either,5
card works like a charm and i always‚Ä¶,Not too bad but you have given a lot of my money away to scammers in the past when u see a bunch of 1.99 to 5.99 you should realize it‚Äôs a scam and a rip off,5
Everything about about Netspend is‚Ä¶,It was a great card but now I hate it alway locking my card,5
The fees are ridiculous,The reason I rate NetSpend 5 stars is simply because of the convenience it offers me when making purchases getting gas paying bills I can very easily stop at my local gas station add cash to the card immediately pay a bill online thank you NetSpend keep up the Great service you're providing best regards to NetSpend staff at every level,5
I like that i get paid 2 days early,"Only recently set up my card for direct deposit but I'm getting paid 2 days early so major plus, so far I am enjoying my NetSpend card, I would recommend this card to my friends",1
Netspend is a good online bank and it‚Ä¶,I love it! So well worth it! Better than my bank,3
You charge for every transaction,Amazing stuff!,5
Good,I deposited 100 into the new account and was chARGED 5.95 FOR NON USE OF THE ACCOUNTi AM CLOSING THIS ACCOUNT,1
You guys just suck plain and simple,Its easy to use a great way to bank if your just starting out. Could adjust in minutes fee price because thats way to much to be taking out of my check,5
Well direct deposit is not 2 days‚Ä¶,I have not had it so far that long so I'm just letting you know so far I like it I like my money to go direct deposit into my account like it does,1
Don‚Äôt like the 1.95 every charge,Great and easy to use,4
Great service,It hard to get a answer for a question you get a big run around people you talk to are very rude  and don't explane very good,1
I can't pull more then 300 dollars on‚Ä¶,There should be a limit per on the 1.50 fee,5
I LOVE IT,Would not recommend this card to NO ONE the charge 2$ EVERY TIME you use your card,3
Horrible fees,It was good love it,5

"Won't let me use app,I've changed my‚Ä¶",It‚Äôs so easy and I love it,5
Awesome staff,Great service I love NetSpend have it now for over 10 years,1
My experience,Netspend was very helpful with question regarding deposit information.,5
I love Netspend,"A representative from NetSpend told me I had to cancel my debit card when Budget Truck company charged me $86.25 for a cancellation that Budget made the day I picked up the rental van. And not only did I pay $25 for a replacement card in 1-2 days but, I didn't have to do that because it was not necessarily stolen. Budget gave me a $75 refund even though I had proof that they took $86.25 and NetSpend never gave me a refund refund with proof after I filed a dispute. And my card came to me 3 days later. NetSpend will charge $25 for a card to be to you in 1-2 days and $20 for it to come in three days. I lost my debit shortly after Budget made an Unauthorized Purchase on my debit card and I didn't want to pay $20-$25 for a replacement again. But, this time because I chose not to pay a fee, NetSpend charged me $9 for a replacement. And it's been 7 days since I called to replace the debit and it's not in the mail. I am cancelling NetSpend because its better to just go to your bank and replace your card as opposed to using NetSpend and having them participate in organized crime and delay your delivery or allow a company to steal money from you. I lost $11.25 with a $75 refund but I also lost $25 because the representative told me to cancel my card or that in order to file a dispute, you HAVE to replace your card.",5
As of July to now I had the worst‚Ä¶,Lov dem and how I get my check a lot earlier it's nice,5
No problem,Everything ain't good to listen please let me know you got the written back in the room and get her pretty well don't get Ang ry and knowing that good so you didn't give me a call on this number and will always go through and I'm well I'm going fine,1

Awesome gets my money in time,I didn't have any problems getting through to customer service or withdrawaling money of of my card,5
good experince,They said they gave me a free $20 and they didn't.  Now I left 1 star.  Maybe I can give a greater rating once I receive my Free $20 without complaining. They probably practice widespread bad business. Can't somebody just hold their own words? Especially at a business like credit? Please. Showstoppers.,5
yoir customer service is horrible i‚Ä¶,Wasn't aware every time I spent even just a dollar I'm charged almost basically $2 so pay basically $4 for a dollar product that,3
After multiple attempts to transfer‚Ä¶,You guys need to put a chip on the card so when your customers use it we don‚Äôt have to swipe it it‚Äôll be much easier,1
I love Netspend,My direct deposits are missing and I only received one out of 3. Social Security said that they been sent two of them.  Yall need to find my money  841.00 756.90  and another one that 841.00 from ssi treas,2

I think it's a great service the only‚Ä¶,Very good service telling my friend about NetSpend,5
If I could give you 0 stars I would,Well if should be technically half a star tbh. I hate that every Damm stupid transaction $1.95 gets taken out fr the only money I have. I want a different plan change that's not going to charge me so damn much every month. Or at that charge me each damn time I use my pos card.,4
I don't like it,The customer service representative hung up on me when I wasn't finished with the problem.,1

Convenient for me,This card charged me over $50 damn dollars in fees!! Ridiculous!! Closing my direct deposit and shutting this over priced card!!!,5
So far so good,I don't like being charged for every purchase that part sucks,4
Horrible is an understatement,"i called customer service and both workers hung up in my face ,  was charging me to use my card",5

To stop a payment,The alert notified by the email was great. The atm was prevent me to withdraw the amount of money was not great. I am authorized to withdrawn some money.,5
I have no problems with netspend so‚Ä¶,Just amazing! I love the fast notifications when activity is detected on my card! No issues whatsoever with this card!,4
No compassion for the misfortunate,I didn‚Äôt give 5 stars because I had to call twice to get my card unblocked.

Terrible service,Great card love the service,5

It's a little frustrating getting money off the card as there is no physical bank, but money transferring is helpful.",5
Down the NetSpend Brick Road,"I wouldn't recommend NetSpend to anyone, I had an dispute for $203 an let them know I know who took my money my kuzin who I took an warrant out on now she is in jail for that an NetSpend didn't fully investigate it like y'all claim y'all fully investigate things but don't an didn't refund my money back an I really needed my money I was going thru a crisis back to back cause if y'all did fully investigate then y'all would have gotten in touch with the store an had the camera pulled with her on the ATM taking my money like the cops did so no I wouldn't recommend y'all to nobody bad business",2

Good,"They are really good with fraudulent purchases, and replacing cards.I been with them over 10 years,just started direct deposit....Thanks again",5
You all suck period I‚Äôm going to Chime,"NetSpend is by far the Best place for my money, they care, correct and deliver the best customer service ever. I‚Äôve been with them a long time and hope to be here much longer.",5
"Netspend, the life savor when you need 1.",Good people understand your need,1
I have had nothing but problems with my‚Ä¶,"The charge for every purchase is nonsense, closing soon",5
It‚Äôs nice working with ya when I need‚Ä¶,I am completely dissatisfied with the blocking of my card when I disputed a purchase.   Then you took a monthly fee of 5$. Then all the new fees on top of it. I am going to get a pay card that has minimal fees and actually builds my credit.  I will not recommend Netspend to anyone.  Only 2 of your numerous employees I spoke with actually could help with resolution.  Wow,1
I love üíì NetSpend,"Excellent service.... Easy to work with, helpful, and curious to say the least....",5
Gud job I love the way it works,They charge a fee even when you add money to cash app ü§£ anything to get a dollar huh ? üëéüèº,5
They Charge to many fees even to take‚Ä¶,I reported 2 fraudulent transactions and card was froze and I already had unactivated card so they activated card but have not transferred funds to new cardSomeone needs to look into my account,5
Charge me for every transaction,Good bank takecare any questions,1
Awesome Company,Never had direct deposit before I don't have to wait on a paper check and keep up with all my expenses love it,1
Great customer service.,I just don't understand why when I buy something like cigarette at 5.45$ u take out 7.00$ u always take out more then what I'm buying why I ask,5
Ok I guess,Love it! Makes spending and saving so much easier,5
Because I have to send in documents‚Ä¶,You guys have an exquisite customer service and I am thankful and I highly appreciate every time I needed you guys you guys was there,4
Love love love this!!,I have been using my Netspend card for about 2 Years. It works great and I have had no issues.,1
kool,I love everything about Netspend except for the fact that numerous times there has been fraud on my Visa card. I never have that problem with my Netspend Mastercard.,5
I don't like the ATM fees it's 2.95 fee‚Ä¶,I signed up for all access for 5 dollars a month according to the agreement there was supposed to be a 2.50 charge for atm withdrawal well they don't tell you that's an additional fee on top of what the atm charges,5
Netspend to me is very helpful and‚Ä¶,So far in my 3-4 years netspend and their services has been a great experience.,3
Cards only work half the time and allow‚Ä¶,Got a new card,5
Thanks MAKING life easy......,Very nice to have,1
Great,Everything is good jus don't agree with the transaction charges were weigels is surcharge free ATM and the card charges me like $3 each time and only get $200 at a time...,5
Best bank out there,"I have not had an account with them very long, but I am very satisfied with it so far. App is very helpful and easy to use.",5
Payments declined,Two because the $1.95 charges everywhere. Direct deposit takes longer than expected... Two days later. Moved money from one account to NetSpend a week later no transfer. Just a check. I don't like paper and don't believe in cutting down trees to make paper. Outrageous and disappointed. Thinking about getting an actual bank account. Not happy and not what I was expecting. Plus customer service can hardly speak English and repeats everything I say and repeats what he said. I'm getting suspicious about netspend,5
Good customer support,Yes me switching to all.access I thought  their  will be free fees but no it's not it charges 2.95 each time or more,1
Good Job NetSpend,I just like using my Netspend for just about everything,5
"Fast,Good,Service","I wish that netspend and netspend all access would communicate with each other, that I don't need two cards accounts.",5
I refuse to pay a $5 maintenance fee,I love using netspend yall are awesome I get paid early and love it,5
I'M ENJOY USING THE CARD.,"Then gentleman helped me tremendly with a situation with the airlines. After he tslked to the lady on reservation, my card was able to fo through.",2
Customer service is great,Love the netspend.com app the card everything,5
Nice On time,i would have like 5$ left and the the 2 times i  i used it it would take out $1.95 did it twice to me n didnt have enough to pay for my meal Was so embarrassed after the second time I canceled my card,5
It charges me every time I use it,I had a problem with a charge on my card and they handled it right away.,5
Money transfers,Y'all policy is trash like how y'all charging me for swiping the card I will never recommend y'all to any one,1
I don't receive my check 2 days,No thank you at this time am sorry just d ont have time and d ont like to wwriting.virgil lee,5
I don't really like the five dollar fee‚Ä¶,"I give NetSpend a 2, because I cannot get money off my card without being charged. I cannot transfer money without a fee and now I got the access account I have to have 400 a month in that account. I thought it would be a better card and it isn't.",4
I love that I get paid earlier with‚Ä¶,Just absolutely disappointed I have direct deposit cannot use the overdraft option like I was told I can I upgraded my account to the overdraft option I have to pay extra money every month to have the NetSpend account still cannot use an overdraft option does not even allow me to take money off my card anymore because it tells me my maximum withdrawal limit for the day has been reached even though I haven't withdrawn money from the card in 2 weeks it's just absolutely ridiculous and I wish that I had never gotten NetSpend,2
Netspend is a great n your card with no problems,I love that I get to get paid 2-3days earlier than my other employees...,5
quality of service is adequate but the‚Ä¶,Nice great friendly service. Yea,5
Good,I like the card unfortunately is not as easy to reload it. I wish they could implement transferring from apps such as Zelle or Venmo to allow for easy reload. Otherwise I have to leave my house to reload and pay a fee,3
Great,"I am always satisfied and confident NetSpend will keep my finances safe. Thanks to the awesome team , especially those that take calls and resolve any issues or concerns. I'm happy to receive my funds now in a timely manner. Thanks again!",5
So far my experience has been great,I love Netspend you get paid two days early. And it‚Äôs so convenient it works everywhere. Even on Apple Pay now.,5
Best prepaid card,I've had a great experience I get my money 2days before just like it says,5
Very helpful customer service,Love that my money is here on Wednesdays instead of Friday. I really appreciate it love your company,4
It worked very well,I love this new card because I can see all transactions and know where I'm using my card thank you for telling me about this card,5
Well at first I had to learn how to‚Ä¶,"Netspend advertises a one-time overdraft, but it does not work.",5
Overdraft fee suck,Never had one single problem with Netspend.,5
Have had issues trying to transfer‚Ä¶,The only negative thing is customer service all don‚Äôt say the same thing and no the same information   I had an old account and needed the numbers and the First Lady couldn‚Äôt fine my old account and the gentleman when I called back found it right away  that‚Äôs all,1
I don‚Äôt like that this acct is more so‚Ä¶,My checks are always on time I just love netspend,3
Tried using the the feature for loading‚Ä¶,This card is great with direct deposit and helping me manage and budget my money I recommend NetSpend to anyone,1
I love banking through Netspend,I really appreciate dealing with NetSpend back it is the best,3
"So, not worth it",Well I went to the gas station 8 days ago and transferred money to my netspend and it wasn't enough so it didn't go thru then I transferred some more and wn went thru the first transaction is still pending when am I getting that money back?,5
I love it,I love Netspend my pay checks always on time,1
I need to add a second cord to my‚Ä¶,$1.50 each time fee too much $1.00 would be better,4
Charged me a 20 fee for a purchase i‚Ä¶,"this is the only debit card i have that charges me to have an account, so i will no longer be using this card or your services. i dont get paid to spend my fuggin money through you guys and thats some fugginbullsheizer.",1
I‚Äôve been with netspend since 2008 I‚Äôve‚Ä¶,This is my first time using netspend and it is good I was lost with out a card to put my money on.,1
Outstanding üíØ,My experiance with netspend has been above my expectations.I will recomend it to my friends.Thank you NetSpend.,5
Good luck,Good I love it let me know what I spend my money on n day,5
Just glad that setting up and using‚Ä¶,I am trying to dispute a fraudulent use of my card where they took $41.94 out of my account without my consent and none of you all I spoke with is giving me the right information. Terrible customer service.And I need my money back from nenoval fictional books. How can you assist me.,5
NetSpend payday it's okay but the only thing I‚Ä¶,I have had a few unfortunate mishaps with my NetSpend card(s) 3 in a short time due to unauthorized charges. Luckily 2 were stopped by NetSpend..I had a long and miserable process to get a new card activated...When talking to a representative I couldn't understand what was being said because of the difference in accents between she and I. Also noises in the background. Their patience with me was null and I spent several hours and days to complete this 10min process. Not to mention calling was put on hold and transferred several times.Im trying to stay with NetSpend even tho I was asked why I don't open a Bank  account instead from several people.They suggested I decline NetSpend.,5
Has taken care of my financial needs‚Ä¶,Since choosing Netspend managing my benefits is much easier and I get notices every time I spend money. I'm never in the dark about how much my balance is.,3
I don‚Äôt even have a netspend account,Fantastic and very great highly recommend,5
Decent could be better but fairly decent,net spend has been easy to use and safe I enjoy the convince of there all access card,1
It was a great card but now I hate it‚Ä¶,Would have given 5 stars but every week I should be getting my pay on Wednesday but it comes on Thursday that's not 2 days sooner that's only one day sooner than if I just got paper checks not sure why but it's frustrating.,5
The reason I rate NetSpend 5 stars is‚Ä¶,Card always works wherever I go.  There's never been a problem,3
Only recently set up my card for direct‚Ä¶,I made a claim an I never received my money back,5
I love it,I am very happy with Netspend I can have my money directly on my card saves me trips to get it cashed and then deposit it. I especially like the bank acct aspect of it.,5
üëçüëçno problems this far,Not happy with with this delay for my dispute made I have payments and am relying on this money and it‚Äôs been almost 10 days now,5
Amazing stuff!!,Its ok still new to netspend.  Maybe in a few weeks will give a updated review,5
I deposited 100 into the new account‚Ä¶,They handled my issues with prompt service and care to attention asking me about anything else they could do  . Was very polite and courteous and professional. Will recommend them to friends without any hesitation  .thank you,5
Cost too much too use,Easy sign up easy transfer something thing I can understand an not having to ask questions.,1
Its easy to use a great way to bank if‚Ä¶,I don't really like it cause y'all charge a late fee an you guys be putting my card in a negative balance and I don't like it if y'all will stop doing negative balances then I will like NetSpend better,1
It‚Äôs ok just don‚Äôt like the charges,Thanks for everything Netspend used to be cheaper years ago.,5
I have not had it so far that long so‚Ä¶,They locked  my card because  someone tried using it,2
Great,"I tried to activate a all access card, kept getting error message so I called. Still couldn‚Äôt get it done. The operator tried but no luck. Still get messages that my account has a hold on it but operator said she couldn‚Äôt find a hold. Still haven‚Äôt gotten it activated.",5
Excellent service love my new card,"Works great, easy to use, just activate and your ready to go!",5
It hard to get a answer for a question‚Ä¶,Great Service and support by customer service !,5
Dollar fifty,I can't have a bank account right now but needed direct deposit for my new job so I used this card. There are A LOT of fees so they overdraw me every week.. but I guess it's still cheaper than bank fees.,3
Would not recommend this card to NO ONE‚Ä¶,Twice in less then a month someone has hacked my account and taken money from me. I even got a new card and haven't used it but to pull money out and my money had been stolen,4
Highly recommend,It's been a long time with y'all and I will continue and tell others of the excellent service.thanks and many y'all continue to prosper and grow.,1

Great service I love NetSpend have it‚Ä¶,GreatBusiness and card has met all my expectations.,5
I love your services,It's ok i like All different types of cards to choose from,5
Starr M.,I like that you can load the card by transferring funds from your debit card but customer service took 30 minutes to reach anyone just to get told I needed to call back at another time. Adding a joint user to your account online would be a lot more convenient than wasting your time with customer service.,5
Netspend has the worst customer service,"The price is right. My daughter has had Boost Mobile for years and has no complaints. And she is on her phone  ""alot"" for business and family. I look forward to a good and more so inexpensive Mobile phone experience.",5
Lov dem and how I get my check a lot‚Ä¶,"I was duped into making a purchase under the auspice that I would only have to pay only postage and shipping cost and the company took $213 from my NetSpend account. I immediately notified NetSpend, they cancelled the card used by myself and transferred my remaining funds to a new account, with a different NetSpend card. These merchants weren't able to exploit me or take advantage of me because NetSpend is vigilant about protecting its customers from unauthorized activity on their NetSpend account. You can't go wrong with NetSpend...",1
Love this card,So far so good but like any bank ...if you can't get to it ...it's scarey,5
Love this card,Thank youReps were of great help and gave me the patience i neededMany thanx,5

Satisfied,Nothing has happened I still cannot access my mobile account,5
"So far, SO GOOD..",Awesome customer service. Can't wait to open savings account.,4
I truly love this card,Very helpful,5
excellent customer support,"The fees are ridiculous, only prepaid card I‚Äôve ever had that charges me to use it. Also the limited about of times you can move money from savings to your normal account, never heard of that either so don‚Äôt even bother with the savings. Unfortunately it‚Äôs been a pretty big disappointment and will probably be looking into other cards in the near future!!!",5
Team effort,I think netspend is great I love using it,5
Good Customer service!,My name is Antoine and by choosing Netspend I can get my checks 2 days earlier and something I never had before which was how fast they gave me an upgrade card that will help me build my credit which is something I never ever had in my 48 years on this Earth !!!! Thanks to Netspend I can and will build my Future !!!!,5
I'm very happy üòÅ,I didn't know that I will be charged for spending my money every month,5

Was on the phone 30mins and still didn‚Äôt get the answer I needed. Had to call and speak with someone else that call was also long and slow process to try and get the answer I was looking for again 30 mins wouldn‚Äôt direct me to department I asked because  I knew from previous call they couldn‚Äôt answer the question about my account.",5
The customer service representative‚Ä¶,"Handy to have in certain situations, as they do offer a banking alternative with similar options, online access, etc‚Ä¶ but utterly ludicrous pricing, really I‚Äôd give this 2.5/5 but I‚Äôm doing them the benefit of rounding up. Get ready for $10 a month OR $1.50 PER transaction (for basic)‚Ä¶.",1
Your guy are perfect people to work‚Ä¶,You charge a fee for EVERYTHING.  REDICULOUSE.,3
Extra,The overdraft isn't what I expected it's advertised as up to $200 and up to five per month disappointed,5
I don‚Äôt think anyone likes the check‚Ä¶,I love my Netspend card. I haven't had any issues with it. I love that I get paid two days early.,3

Professional,Great job love having Netspend as my primary checking and savings accounts.,1
This is a very good feedback,Making sure that no one can get money off of my card without my approval.,5
Love my Netspend card!,"The agent would not transfers to a supervisor, She gave information that was different from what was previously told to us. We were told we would have to wait a certain amount of days to be contacted about are claim and then in the middle of the call she changed the amount of days smh She couldn't do simple math when It came to counting the calendar and just kept repeating herself. Very frustrating and then I just got my new card I had a wire transfer coming and just opened my account and just  before I got my new card they cancel my account my account. Awful",5
Too much money to withdraw 6 dollars‚Ä¶,I can not add money to my card using the transfer me to me and it limits my transfers. I need it to do what I wnat or I don't need it,5
This card charged me over $50 damn‚Ä¶,"Received a credit to my card due to returning an item at a store and had went through the run-around to get NetSpend to release it. Customer Service told me to do different things and the manager took over an hour to get on the phone and was absolutely no help. I was first told it was no block on my account and can withdraw. Then called back and was told to email a receipt (original) and they will release the block. I emailed the original receipt and the receipt that showed the credit amount. Then I received an email back saying that they can not accept it and to get a letter head from the company and it had to have certain info on it to be released. Called NetSpend again, and got the run-around so I asked to speak with a supervisor. She was not considerate to the fact that I have been calling all day and not getting the correct info and she either put me on mute or sat the phone down, because I kept saying hello and there was no answer but the phone did not hang up. Called the Merchant and was told they do not do that and they can give me an invoice with all info on it. Emailed that to NetSpend and finally my money was released. It took over a week to do this. NetSpend reason on why this happened was because my credit balance was over $200. I will know next time to not ever have anything credited to that card.",1
I don't like being charged for every‚Ä¶,when i try to reach out to you by phone i waited 36 minutes and no one answered and i did this several times and i think that is bad for business.,1
i called customer service and both‚Ä¶,"I have 3 NetSpend cards. I've had two orders for a 70"" smart tv. From a seller who's tracking number, I can't find any results. It has been over1 1/2 mths.

No good anymore,"I‚Äôm Enjoying Netspend, Everything is Wonderful",5
Great customer service,Ur customer service stinks half the people I talk to aren't listening to what is being said they r to busy making their point  bout what they thought u said or were thinking wow,1
Fees suck,Filed a dispute where I was double charged for a transaction by a merchant. I don't believe my card should have been deactivated.  My reason for the low rating is the lack of human interaction.,5
too many fees to use app.,I have had zero problems anytime I wanna use my card it always works pay as u go is the way to go for me and it's easy to load money on and easy to use,3
Rhe customer service rep was very‚Ä¶,Not helping not helping,4
My experience,It does everything I need it to do.,5
The alert notified by the email was‚Ä¶,"So far, outstanding.",5
Wonderful,I'm not happy with all of the fees. Their are way too many charges. You take way too much money out of my pay.,4
I didn‚Äôt give 5 stars because I had to‚Ä¶,NetSpend is okay when you need to order things and you don't want to use your personal card but each order that you put on there and if your order be separated they charge $1.50 for each one of the order ending up as me not having enough money for the last order that comes through because you will not let them take the money out unless you have that dollar and 50%,5
Still need my money from Netspend‚Ä¶,NetSpend has been everything I expected it be. Easy to use. Easy to add funds to the card.,5
Netspend review,Good service Justin wish it was without extra charges or fees,3
Like oh my God so good makes me wet‚Ä¶,I switched to the new card last month and I don't believe the discrepancy  in my funds and all the different service charges when I now pay a monthly few. I haven't been able to get into my account to verify anything  we can't access that account and they weren't able to help me with the matter,5
Been great so far.,The fees suck when it's my money and I already pay taxes,5
Rating for my Netspend card,Works great if you don‚Äôt mind the fees which are plentiful,4
I love NetSpend this is very helpful to‚Ä¶,Fees everything else is great,5
So far so good and fast,"Thank you for the service you give my family and I, the alerts are great and the texts showing balance is helpful too.",5
Worry about fraud?,I've used netspend for 8yrs...when it first came out..Best card if there's unotherise transactions they are on your side...It hopen to me 5 times an they gave me bk my money..Netspend allacess just got it..the only complaint is I've got direct deposit an my pay doesn't come any earlier,5
I got it yall they are really helping us,"Not only was I on the phone for 30+ minutes, she was rude, sarcastic, and impatient. To complete her poor behavior she filed the dispute for the wrong amount of money. I must have explained the scenario 3 times and she NEVER understood it.",4
Great card,You guys do a great job and keep up the good work!!,5
Great service,Just don't like the monthly fee. That's my only complaint,5
Free $20 for review,"charged 1.50 everytime you use the card, a bit outragous..",5
A fake website took my money and‚Ä¶,I love what you are doing.,5
i love this online banking service‚Ä¶,Very good if you need something you talk to a person not a computer,1
NetSpend is a extremely DISHONEST,"I have been using Netspend for at least 10 years. I have had fraudulent charges, stolen card and many other issues over the years. Netspend has resolved every one of them and has even been there to get money back from Yahoo.I always recommend Netspend to everyone.  I only use a local bank, savings account only, to get money orders and coins as needed. My only complaint is the website logout button is not in a convenient place.",5
They are ok,I LOVE NETSPEND BEEN WITH THEM ABOUT 10+YRS NEVER HAD A PROBLEM.,1
I love this online banking service,I'd give you less than one star if that option was available,3
Very reliable card,I dont like netspend they take fees for everything,5

Netspend is a great service,Great service which makes it easier to bank without any problems.,5
Best card Ever,Great very useful,5
I have had nothing but exceptional‚Ä¶,I totally don‚Äôt agree about the monthly fee that you guys charge. When I looked at my account my balance was $0.00. Then the next day I had a negative $5.00 balance due to the fact that you guys charged me a monthly fee!!! Do you know how many prepaid cards out here that don‚Äôt charge a monthly fee!!! I know of one that I will be signing up for as soon as I close out this review. I‚Äôm going to Chime!!!! I will be closing this Netspend account and make sure I tell everyone that I know NOT to use you guys and of they already have an account with you guys to close it out and go over to Chime!!!!,5
Great customer service,I have tried to enroll in anytime alerts and can't get a live person to assist me eitherHow about some help with this please!Thank youTony Simmons,5
Fees and Holds,I love netspend I have been using it for year‚Äôs now everything is great I only have 1 problem with them they lock your online account way to fast and make it way to hard to get back in but on the + side someone is there to talk to when your account gets lock there's a lot more really good things about NS I will use it for as long as I can,5
It say u got $20 I still haven't seen it,"I have been with this company since 2007 and I am just really angry with this Co.  My biggest concern is money being  taken and charges come through that you haven't done.  The process to recover your funds is ridiculous!!!  Your card in hand now gets shut down and you have to wait for another card.to be mailed to you. Plus we are charged now a $20 fee for the card to arrive in two days.  Really!  You can have multiple cards with the Co. and sometimes you might have to transfer funds from one to the other.  Well they charge you a fee to transfer your money within the same Co.  Should just take a simple click to transfer!  Should be free to me.  So don't have an emergency or charges come up when your on vacation that causes you to fall short on your trip. Your taking a BIG chance with this Co. If you say no thank you, I'll pass.  Skip over GO2 Bank cause that's this Co. too!!!!!",4
Service has-been average. I want mkre free money,Thanx for being with me in times when I needed help. And in general got a lot to be thankful for thankful for life and everything that is around it.                                                     Gracias.,3
easy to use and convenient,I was in the market for a direct deposit debit card and was applying here and there. Went to check the mail and there you guys were ahead of everybody else. I'd say excellent timing and service is remarkable. Thank you for showing up right when I needed one.,4
I absolutely love Netspend‚Ä¶It‚Äôs just so‚Ä¶,Great banking  üëçüèΩ,5
THE BEST CARD I HAVE EVER HEARD OF IN‚Ä¶,They charge me fees for just checking my balance.  Customer service is bad when you finally get to a person.  Then it's the same person who answered the call. Not a good experience,5
Greatest card ever,Not effective enough to make s difference :-/,5
My card,"Awesome bank card! Get my paycheck 3 days early and in the afternoon! No insane monthly fees, great experience overall!",5
Love Netspend easy to use,I had no issues I love NetSpend and will recommend it my family and friends,5
Love it,I was charged $1.50 every time I swiped my Netspend debit card.,5
They r good blood,"Netspend is very user friendly for all ages, all credit types, with no worries of having a bill come later on! Their online, in person at so many locations even in small towns are very convenient with every way possible to add funds to your account and or transfer funds to other Netspend Card members. If you are just starting off this would be a great way to learn how to budget your finances or if you have less than perfect credit, Netspend allows you the tools and platform needed to repair previous credit mistakes by still having access to be able to have direct deposits made, pay bills, shop online, and many other features. I highly recommend Netspend to literally everyone no matter your age, your personal financial situation or your credit score.",5
I've been able to track all my expenses‚Ä¶,So far everything has been running smoothly,5
Great,"Time goes by slowly for those who wait‚Ä¶I was having trouble adding my card to my Apple Wallet. The error message I received said to contact t the issuing bank, so I called the toll free number. The agent there had no idea what I meant when I said I was trying to add my card to my Apple Wallet. He kept telling me to go online‚Ä¶ go online . . . go online and do it there. I couldn‚Äôt get ANYWHERE with him so I told him thank and goodbye, and wrote a very detailed email message. It‚Äôs been 48 hours and I‚Äôve heard nothing. . .but I DID get this email asking me to write a review about the service I received. Well, I didn‚Äôt get ANY service. Nothing got fixed, nor has it since. I did contact Apple, and they assured me that the issue lied with NetSpend and they have to resolve it.Still waiting. . . .",4
I love my Netspend All Access account,I hate this prepaid account,5
I like it like when spend on my messages,"Thank you, you're the best",5
A Refreshing App in the Banking World,I have called costumer service several times and can‚Äôt get the help I need nobody seams to know what they‚Äôre doing. I have paid the fee where I‚Äôm not charged for each transaction but I‚Äôm still being charged for each transaction and it‚Äôs eating my money up and nobody will help me. Bad service!!,5
I didn't get 20 dollars,Everything about this card and the company sucks,4
They are nice people that talk to you‚Ä¶,Can I get a loan from your bank or did my money came through on the card yet I really need some money for things I need and pay my rent if y'all can do a loan please let me know and how much I can do alone for or when do I receive my exercise to receive my SSI benefit disability claim check,1
I did not receive all my money back‚Ä¶,I've used NetSpend now for more than 10 year and they always stand behind their customers and every time I filed a dispute they would stand behind me I love these guys great service and extreme loyalty,5
I trust this bank,The availability of loading money into the Netspend card is so very simply now.  No hassling with the clerks.  I enjoy just walking up to a Walgreens and load,2
This is a really good card and accurate‚Ä¶,I have three account with them and I did get hacked and they were amazing. They investigate very quickly and refund the money with out a problem and since then I have not had an issue they are great,5
Most outstanding debtcard account Ive‚Ä¶,"Net spend, have been a blessing for me. They have help helpful, respectful when I talk with them. They have proven to be honest and dependable.  I would tell everyone  on the wonderful service they have given me.",5
Love it makes getting deposits easy,You all do a great job . I love netspend.,5
I love my card it comes in handy when I‚Ä¶,I just got my first card someone got my number. Then trying to get a new one . Then u send me out two more cards. It sames when I put money on it then try to buy something it not all there. My first card had 43 dollars on it & it didn‚Äôt came on my new card. When I call customer service to get how much is in my account I get the run around. All I want is to put money in it for I can get things I want also put money on it for games I play on my phone.,5
Have been very impressed,Couldn't let me withdraw only $400 at an ATM,5
Card with substance,I have written email and I tried to call this app customer service several times wanting a pending truck and transaction to to be taken off and so the money can be put back into my available balance it's been a week and nothing is changed and I still can't access my money and and I'm not liking it at all that's my review for this,4
Always kind and helpful,"I am not impressed! The fact that you charge $1.50 for every single transaction is ridiculous! I bought some dish soap for $2.50 or so, and you charged me $1.50 for that transaction? Unacceptable!! I used an ATM at Wells Fargo Bank to take out $50.00 for my elderly mother and they charged me $3.50. You charged me another $2.50 for that same transaction? Again, UNACCEPTABLE!! I will not be continuing with your service after my card is empty! I'll be cancelling my card and your services! There are much better options out there! I got ripped off for $180.22 and I was promised that you would help me with this, but I guess that was a blatant lie!! You've done absolutely nothing that impresses me!! I only gave you 1 star because there was no option for a half a star!!!",5
I have been with NetSpend for over 4‚Ä¶,"I have no complaints. NetSpend has done what they said. I don't have a lot of money coming in, but what lil I do, I don't want cash on me. I feel safe and secure knowing my finances will be there when I need them.",5

I love netspend,It's cool. Wish it would build my credit.,1
I have Netspend for about 6 years,I've been waiting for a refund on concert tickets that I didn't get to use for a month!I'm actually on hold right now with them. I emailed in what they needed me to and I don't even hear about my claim anymore when I call on my card. It shouldn't be taking this long. The world is horrible right now and gas prices are outrageous! I can't go anywhere or do anything without money for gas. Can't even get a scooter!!!,5
It's a great service and I recommend,To many fees. It's 1.50 extra anytime you use the card,5
I've always had great luck with net‚Ä¶,I really like the company because I think it is awesome because we get paid early,5

Love it,I've had some experience with Netspend in the first part of the year. But over it fairly good.,1
Simple and easy!,They have definitely been a life saver for me while on vacation.,5
Looks good,Would like to be able to have more options and features between the app and the website itself. Otherwise far better security features compared to Chime!,5
I have really enjoyed the service I‚Ä¶,Was very easy to report a charge on my card,5
I didn't receive my 20 dollars on my‚Ä¶,I hate the 1.95?fees for using the card anywhere and to send money,5
"I ordered on line about midnight,it was‚Ä¶","Not too happy with netspend. I filled a claim in a purchase and was denied for false reasons. They claim I never sent paper work and that was a lie. When I called the manager,  he was rude, yelled at me,  and hung up on me.  I am switching my accounts and advising my followers NOT to do business with netspend. I am very unhappy. I felt dismissed, disregarded and disrespected. I ended up getting my money back directly from the company in a check form. Which i DID NOT deposit on my netspend card. Don't want to deal with netspend again. I am closing all my accounts and my family""s accounts. Let's see if they share this one.",4
I keep getting locked out of my account‚Ä¶,It was to easy for someone to get access to my card,5

Unreliable,"In 2 years with NetSpend, I had over $10,000+ stolen out of my NetSpend bank account & NetSpend reimbursed me exactly $947 of the over $10,000+ of unauthorized fraudulent account activity, horrendous non English speaking or understanding Customer Service",4
I love my NetSpend account very‚Ä¶,When you call to get info from the company they haven't a clue how to help anybody I legit signed up then stopped my payment to the card cause when I called no one that answered could speak proper English or had a clue what I was asking for it was very simple I needed routing information,1
My Deposit is always on time,Terrible card service and couldn't dispute something on a card that I lost. Reason I'm leaving netspend.,5
Helpful,Thank you for all,5
They are understanding,1.95 each transaction way to prey on the less fortunate NetSpend....,5

Really need to have all current and pending transactions for me to be able to correctly budget myself for the week.,3
I didn't receive my 20 that u said that‚Ä¶,I do not like that every last swipe of my card cost me money. It was easy to put money on. But out of 40 I had less than 30 because it charged me for using it at a store. Had I knew of this prior I would not have had my money to be coming to this card.,4
I like the service they give you and I‚Ä¶,Netspend is good but what I wish is that thier customer service could be faster.,5
I never received my $20,Rating yall a three don't know why you charge me a dollar every time I use my card when u used to charge me 5.00 amonth,5
I don't like that it's costing me $5.00‚Ä¶,"My netspend card was declined for 2 transactions.  Netspend still took $1.95 from my account two times.  I emailed them and they said they would respond around 48 hours.  Now I have been waiting over a week.  I am disabled, not working, and not collecting SSI so can't afford to just flush $4 down the crapper.  Thanks Netspend.",2
Got me through my day to day activities,Love it great card will let everyone know too,3

I love using netspend easy to use and‚Ä¶,Keeps charging me randomly bills dropping it negative when I haven‚Äôt even used the card yet and just got it last week when it was supposed to be here a month ago,5
Great experience,"Netspend is horrible when my cousin used my card without my authorization and I disputed the charges and did everything I was supposed to do Netspend treated me like dirt and refuse to give me my money back although I went to the police and filed charges and provided them with a police report and my cousin was charged, I still was out of $3,800.00 and I have been a loyal customer with Netspend for over 10 years Smh I will never recommend Netspend to anyone",5

Love it always helpful.,"I don't like how.this company lies to me about my debit card being able to be unlocked with just a phone call or via email. ( I did both with a negative outcome). That wasn't the case!! Instead Netspend not only blocked my card, which I asked to be done.But you guys deactivated my card . I talked to 4 different representatives only to find out my card had been cancelled!!! Smh!!",3
Thanks very much,"I ordered a new card, because I lost the other card. I still haven't received it. It has been 2 weeks today, since I ordered it.",5
Great,I just want to say that what I don't like is that I tried to send some money through cash app to my daughter and for some reason cash app said that they do not accept debit cards I know it's not your fault but I rather have a credit card so I can send money through cash app thank you Ray Mundo Sanchez over and out,5
It‚Äôs help lot and wise of budge as no‚Ä¶,"How bout faster and quicker response times. Wete talking 5 minute wait times. No need for long wait times. More complete organized business. Work at it throughly. Everytime for 5 minutes. Oh ok , cya Drew M",5

Excellent service,"I rated netspend ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ mainly because I have been a client for quite some time now, and have been using the account actively and generally speaking, as a customer who is given the option and advantage to choose how to manage your account, such as mobile deposits, funds are made available in minutes with an additional cost or get the full amount by waiting 3 for 4 business days is awesome üëå and I'm loving it.  Overall based of my use experience i haven't yet encountered any major issues whatsoever üôÉ Thank you Netspend Tj",5

Good to be a member,A bank you can't count on to stop a fraudulent deduction from occuring... I'm opening a different account tomorrow... You people are a lame branch of trustworthy money transferers...,5
That I get my money I work for early‚Ä¶,"Here's an update from my last review. After reading my review, NetSpend told me to send them an email so they could look into it. I sent the email on 06/07/22, yet, no one has tried to contact me. I tried to refile my dispute, because I didn't agree with their decision. I was told that I couldn't file a dispute because the transactions were already disputed. I just want my money so I can close this account. Horrible business.",5

Just excellent,"You guys are great, Nice, and Very Kind...",5
Direct deposit in 2 days ahead of the‚Ä¶,I don't like this debit card service the o ly reason I have it is because of the fact that it's a little easier to use than the other ones you Tebnever on time or accurate or fair. I hate you all very much because you ruled against me twice that I tried to get money bach from a service I did not start or recieve.,5
Absolutely love netspend,I called to complete a dispute on my card ending in 2925 as my wallet has been stolen. I have a additional card ending in 1232 that was not in my wallet at the time it had been stolen. The dispute is currently being investigated for card ending in 2925. I tried to take out money ending in 1232 only to find that I could not. I called your customer service number only to be told that that account is closed and a check is being mailed to me in 7 to 10 business days. I was going on vacation and needed that money right away. I was never told that that account would be closed. Therefore I was unable to go on vacation. I will never use your services it again.,4
It's a great card  except it charges a‚Ä¶,5stars all day,5
Excellent work...love your card,It's good for what it is but the monthly fee is kind of a bummer. It's helped me do online banking that I couldn't do before.,5
Thank you but I don't remember getting‚Ä¶,I think you charge too much money for just about every transaction. Every time I use it to shop I‚Äôm charged. Very unfair. Most people who use Netspend have no other options because otherwise they would use a bank   The fact u only allow 200 at a time from aATM with a fee for each time is absurd! You should allow 500 a day !!! I‚Äôm hoping to find a card that doesn‚Äôt charge the crazy fees Netspend does on each and every transaction.,5
Love this card!,My account was compromised and you caught it before it hurt too bad. I appreciate the alerts and getting to know your customers.,5
Like Netspend I get deposit 3daye early,I started having problems with the company after I found a fraudulent charge made using my card info that I know I didn't make. I was told to cancel and deactivate that card and order a new one. So I complied did what I thought was a smart thing to do to prevent future incidents from happening. Only to have someone drop the ball and not investigate what happened and losing the money not finding out until I had to call back due to another issue a month later. It's seems like they are not organized or communicate as a financial institution and I find that unfortunate for the many of us who rely on them for our financial needs. The $2 per transaction fee has me looking for another bank! Ridiculous,5
I've been with Netspend for 8 years and‚Ä¶,I'm having problems with my NetSpend card account they charged me fees and taxes then told me I'd be refunded for them and still I have not been credited back the money. I usually don't have any problem's and up until this point service was great so I am trying not to let it get me too where I choose another pre paid card company. Thank you for taking the time to read this and have a wonderful day and I know it's not your fault lol and I am appreciative of you all.,5
My review,NetSpend always takes care of all your problems and a great card to do business with thay always have your back,5

Work great and have been using often,You guys rock. You guys are basically my bank account and I love the fact that you let me pick the my own picture on my card. I have a Marilyn Monroe faced card that's pink and purple and I get so many compliments on it everybody's like where did you get that I didn't know you could do that? So I feel very privileged to have it no one else has ever seen anyone else with one but Plus you guys do me good you really do I just wish you had free ATMs somewhere,4
Joyful,Good service and letting you know immediate balance after a transaction.,5
Netspend is awesome,I don't like being charged 1.95 for each transaction my husband has net spend and he isn't charged,5
I absolutely love your service and I‚Ä¶,So far I have thoroughly enjoyed using Netspend for my direct deposit and bill paying needs I would highly recommend this card to any of my friends. Being a Netspend customer is fast and easy,5
Very helpful people with my account‚Ä¶,Only issue i have is the $1.50 transaction fee otherwise perfect,5
Insufficient Funds I recently forgot my car ininsuffsurance auto‚Ä¶,I give netspend one star because years ago doing Amazon fresh out of Georgia netspend still owe me a check they never deposited on my netspend card. I never delt with netspend again and I'd never recommend netspend to no one else. I couldn't never get in contact with no one from netspend about my money.,5
Very helpful and alert,Awesome to bank with always on top of your problems,4
A direct deposit went to the wrong‚Ä¶,I am still trying to wrap my head around all these fees. Outrageous.,5
I have really enjoyed how I get direct‚Ä¶,I have 2 cards with netspend  that I can't use.  One the bank took card  at the ATM and wouldn't give I t back despite having my money still  in the account.. the Second  I can't activate it no matter what I do.  I call reset and online but nothing works. I went to 5th3rd bank for help and he wasn't able to get it working  either despite  numerous  calls  etc. It has fifty on it and the other card had 89.. i want money returned t o me .,1
Very fast,"Getting charged 1.50 for every transaction is criminal.  Cost money to add money,  which is what it is. But being charged 1.50 for every transaction i made is wrong.  Its only 1 start because negative stars isn't a option.",5
great time with the service,I have been using netspend for a while and have never had any issues I love the service,5
It's has been great no complaint,Netspend is easy to use.lots of ways and places to load money.hope to have a long history with Netspend,5

I love Netspend!!,I‚Äôve reached out multiple times with no help I was told too call a number in which I did and was no help either and still can‚Äôt log in to my account and I been trying too log in for months so I honestly can say it‚Äôs horrible customer service,5
Great card to have!,Fees are ultimately what caused me to stop using the card. I thought it would also be more helpful to raising my credit score.,5
My direct deposit is always a day early.,I never got my reward for refer a friend that my friend and I used when I got my new account with NetSpend. I called customer service and they said they fixed the problem but they didn't.,5

I love their app it‚Äôs easy to use and‚Ä¶,"I signed up for an upgrade, which I did and also mentions that if we register for Direct Deposit we get that direct deposit 2 days earlier but I'm not getting it as soon as it was mentioned. Hope you guys could resolve that",5
Great card to use,I like it. I just dislike the fact that you and cashapp isn't supported.,5
Great service,No complaints  good and courteous service,5

This has helped me with how I spend‚Ä¶,I just ordered a new card online and it came within 7-10 business days and it was easy to activate my debit card and it sends messages every time I make a purchase to let you know how much there is in my card and i love it,5
Good customer service,I‚Äôve been with Netspend for over 10 years and I love this company!,5
I love me some Netspend,Because I don‚Äôt find no reason that I need to get charge $1.95 for every purchase I do with a card that is ridiculous and I feel like your company is stealing my money so I close my account and I don‚Äôt want to do any business with this bank ever again,5

Super card,I love the prepaid card and multiple cards and transfers from card to card. The only thing I would like is a different type of account from Netspend after having a good standing account for so long and a ok credit score some type of credit account,4
It takes to long to progress the money‚Ä¶,"Great experience so far. Acct number is too big to link to cash app though. The charging for early deposits is understandable yet should advertise that way, currently it's kinda shady",5

I received a payment on the wrong card‚Ä¶,Garbage! Didn't realize you p.o.s. was going to charge me 1.95 or whatever it is for everything like I went to get a soda that costs $0.60 but I could get it because I only had $1.49 or whatever on my card so basically you guys are just going to steal that money from me because I can't use it for anything based on your theft ring fees you have put in place!,4
I love these cards always reliable and‚Ä¶,The closing of my account without notification could have been handled differently..Especially by me being the primary card holder..,5
Needed help with my pin for good help‚Ä¶,"Once Net Spend saw that someone tried to hack into my account, Net spend stopped them by suspending my account so these Hackers couldn't go any further. Thanks again Net Spend Security. CBrown",5

I got this card bc I needed to buy something and was having problems due to my maiden name being different from married name on my bank account. This card doesn‚Äôt tell you that they charge you and inactive fee.  They also charge you a fee for having to provide a signature on a transaction at a business, unless you pay 9.95 a month.

I reported 2 fraudulent transactions‚Ä¶,"Netspend handled everything that needed to be done in regards to receiving my taxes. They were easy to work with, prompt and precise with their communications, and I never really had to do anything. I honestly forgot about it until the money was received, so that should tell you that it‚Äôs a very easy service to deal with. Their fees are very reasonable as well, only taking a VERY small percentage of the deposit. I had no issues at all.",1
Good,Netspend is amazing they make everything easy and legible.  I highly recommend,1

Love the new card,I‚Äôve had Netspend for a few years now I love it because I always get my deposit a day earlier than what I everybody else does I have had some issues with people getting a hold of my card number and taking money off my car so I will say that as far as you guys looking into things like that I am not satisfied because This is the second time in two months that I‚Äôve had to get a new card. So security for your money isn‚Äôt the best with Netspend however getting your money faster is but that‚Äôs really the only perk that I have with my card,5
I've had a great experience I get my‚Ä¶,"Thanks for the fast help by phone, nice to speak to a human, and not get the loop around.",5

It's consistently a good app,Way too many fees. Debit card transactions declined repeatedly even though I have the money for the purchase and fees. Bank transfers declined repeatedly even though I have the money to transfer and the fees. No customer support whatsoever and it's been well over 48 hours.,5
Good I love it let me know what I spend‚Ä¶,I love how I can put money on my card and pay as I go,5
I am trying to dispute a fraudulent use‚Ä¶,"I had a charge for an overdraft I didn‚Äôt make.  I called customer service and told the lady what happened.  She couldn‚Äôt understand what I was explaining to her and made her own conclusion that my card was stolen.  I repeatedly stated my card was not stolen and needed the error resolved.  The charge was corrected, but my card was canceled and I had to order a new one and pay for express delivery ($25.00) so I could have a way to pay for things.  The customer service is terrible.",5
For once wasn't on hold forever,Love it  just need to get text with I put money on credit and text on Blanca to thanks for every thing you dow love it,1
I have had a few unfortunate mishaps‚Ä¶,I like Netspend. I can pay a bill on line without using my Bank card so that way nobody gets my information plus Netspend alearts my phone when the card has been used. I highly recommend it,5

To expensive!!!,Great card good features for the card i like how you can use the netspend app to look at your spending,5
net spend has been easy to use and safe‚Ä¶,Charging a 2.00 fee each purchase a total rip-off,2
Would have given 5 stars but every week‚Ä¶,"Great Great Service, I must say",5
Debit card honored,I appreciate you guys canceling my card without letting me know is that good customer service now I had to wait for a new card and my bills are behind because of that now I have to wait for a new card because you guys don't let people know when you cancel their cards that's not good customer service and when I talk to the people they act like I didn't know what I was talking about so you need to train your people how to answer people's questions !Thanks,4
I made a claim an I never received my‚Ä¶,The best and they treat u with care and kinds and there all ways there to help you out,5
I am very happy with Netspend I can‚Ä¶,It works for what i need it for so thank you,1
Not happy with with this delay for my‚Ä¶,This card is great my deposit is done the day before I get text messages every time I use it so it gives me how much my balance is finding a reload place is excellent definitely a 5 out of 5,5
Great card for finiacial reasons,I am completely satisfied with my experience and with the service that I am receiving,2
You guys is a thief,So far I have had no negative issues with Netspend. I have only used it so far to load and transfer money to see if it works properly and it has. It loaded instantly each time as well as the transfer. I will use it more and more to see if the consistancy is positive and if so I will use it full time.,5
Great service thank you,Someone had gottn my information tried using my account,1
Its ok still new to netspend,Good handy card to have but I don't like the fees I think they could be less..,5
Everything was great,I love that I get text messages and updates on account regularly,3
They handled my issues with prompt‚Ä¶,Very good helpful,5
Easy sign up easy transfer something‚Ä¶,Everytime I try to use the card it declined. This makes me look bad like I don't have any funds. Thank you.,5
I don't really like it cause y'all‚Ä¶,The card is very user-friendly and easy to understand even for a novice but two days after turning it on they decide to go ahead and take the monthly fee as soon as I put the money on the account so I don't know how well it spends anything,4
Good debt  card,Thank you for your service.,2
I really do like Netspend,I enjoy the early direct deposit and how easy it is to use everyday at stores and online,5
Good,"Haven't  really had any issues compared to alot of other prepaid cards I've tried,so far so good,I've got no complaints as of yet but time will tell.",5
I love it AAAA+,Good love have it for shop,5
Activating a card,"I have a question. I am a new Netspend Customer.:                                                  I am awaiting Direct Deposit from IRS. When that transaction is effective, Do I need to call you to TRANSFER the funds from my Deposit (or Balance) Account onto my Debit Card? Or will the bank automatically load my card?Please respond. Thank You.",5
Works great,I love overdraft helps out so so much thanks netspend,3
Great sevice and support !,Good and fast service I,5
Good alternative,CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIBLE HOLD TIME IS UNACCEPTABLE!!!! HOW CAN YOU JUSTIFY GIVING SOMEONE A JOB WHERE THEY'RE PRIMARY JOB IS TO TALK ON PHONE WHEN THEY CAN HARDLY SPEAK ENGLISH!?!?!?! UNACCEPTABLE AND UNPROFESSIONAL.,5

It's been a long time with y'all and I‚Ä¶,NetSpend is a good debit card I enjoy banking with them I like getting my check early up to 3 days early,1
Excellent card to have,I'm trying to figure out where $170 went to when my income taxes were deposited to my card Turbo tax said one amount and I got a different amount it was like i said about $170 short i would like to know where it went and would like for NetSpend to make this right thank you,5
My honest opinion,So far all is good! Starting in August let's see how you do with my monthly SSI payments,5
Always had good experiences with NetSpend.,Easy to open and good communication.  We opened this account for a targeted purpose but may use it for a daily account.,5
WHAT I EXPECTED,Don‚Äôt like the atm fees and definitely don‚Äôt like that I can‚Äôt take out all my paycheck at once to the daily limits! It‚Äôs my paycheck and I‚Äôd prefer taking my money all at once to save on those ridiculous atm charges!,5
Great,They are great they offered me overdraft protection. When I told them how much my check was and may have up to 2000 in my account in a month now if they only hold their end up I will hold mine.,3
On point and very helpful.,Over all happy,5
It's ok it works you very quick,This card charges fees on top of being charged for ATM fees and store fees,5
Great experience no problems,You suck you promised me postdebit credit I vd been with you over 11/2 years and I don't like it no rewards no post debit credit nothing every month I have an issue with my card and I'm. Making this the last month you people are no good I want a post debit ok I n we'd one you'll get get it back on my next deposit I can't even get the 10 dollars you promised me every month or the rewards u promised me signing up so unless you help me screw you your a national scam card as far as I'm concernedgojd day,5
"Good perks, lacking features","""...with NetSpend, I got this..."". I had a problem with activation, I was done activating my card and then suddenly after that an email came saying, you have to activate your card.  I'm confused.  Anyway, everything about NetSpend is a 5-star.  Yup, it's a 5-star.",5
The price is right!,Good Business. Great Results.,3
I was duped into making a purchase‚Ä¶,"Don't like 2.00 charge every time I use card... There's always an issue when I want to add money to my card, @ reload center!",5
So far so good but like any bank ...if‚Ä¶,once again you guys did the thing all is good,5
Thank you,I like Netspend because they have low rates and you don't have to worry about all the high interest rates for using their cards,4
I like the way Control my money,"It's convenient, easy to use and is accepted in most venues.",5
This is a great card,"Everything about this bank sucks.The AppThe Bank itself Customer ServiceMind you they claim everything is free yet they randomly charge you to open the account, days after it's already been open",5
I enjoy using NetSpend I love the‚Ä¶,I had a netspend account for years with my bank setup and was sending $300 to $500 into my account with no problem. Then you made me upgrade to the new advanced Netspend and never could setup my bank account ever. Call support sent emails nobody knew how to fix  my problem so closed my account and open a new account and got the same message my account is not enabled to receive electronic transactions. Got the same message from both of my banks. Had to go thru PayPay to put money from my bank into PayPal wait four days transfer it into my Netspend wait another four days then finally get my funds into my account but a pain in the you know what. Don‚Äôt expect you to help me but I thank you for returning my feedback message. I know this is a feedback but can‚Äôt give it a five star because of the inability to setup my two bank accounts to send money into my Netspend account. I had to go the PayPal route to get funds into my account. Which works but takes longer. If I could go Bank to Bank it is faster. But when I try to set up my banks I get an error that my Netspend bank account is not setup to receive electronic transactions. Very hard to deal with this much longer.,5
U guys suck,They would not give me a over draft fee back when they automatically signed me up after they sent me a new card.,5
Wonderful,I would like to know why do you have to pay 5.00 every month for the card,1
Thank you for the experience,Y'all got to many charges,5
Best debit card ever,I was supposed to receive my SSI on the 1st but I didn't and I thought I would receive it 2 days in advance so hopefully for the month of July I will,5
I like your card very much,This is where all my direct deposits go this is a great place nothing wrong with NetSpend thank you NetSpend you're a lifesaver,5

Awesome customer service,Thank you for good service timely direct deposits,5
Hard workers,Nothing but bliss thus far! Really enjoy the two days early direct deposit feature and the Flashpay ID to transfer funds to another NetSpend card holder!,5
The fees are ridiculous,Everything is fine until you start using it out of state,5
I think netspend is great I love using‚Ä¶,"The service is good,but the platforms used are hard to understand.when a customer pays for a service that service should be met without extra unmentioned fees and hidden cost.The delivery of the service should be just as easily accessible as the payment of the service was.No customer wants to pay for a service and not only wonder when and if the transactions will go thru,but also have to deal with extra hidden cost in order to obtain it.",2
My name is Antoine and by choosing‚Ä¶,I don't like being charged everytime I pay for something at store or eating out .,5
I'm a satisfied customer of netspend,"Helped solve a big problem for me... I totally  Appreciate Net Spend. Thank you for popping in, when u did.",5

hotel dispute,You charge for every transaction I'm changing cards very soon,4
Thank you for good service,"I just want to say that Netspend is great and your money can be sent or received quickly with fast alert. Just make your card more flexible to where we can use for multiple things, not just paying bill‚Äôs. But I love to have and use Netspend. Thank you and thanks for your great services",5
Very hard to get information about your‚Ä¶,Great my money is good,5
Outrageously High Fees! $1.50 per transaction..,Overall my experience has been good except on one occasion when I reported my card as lost but they still direct deposited my paycheck to that lost/stolen card. Other than that it's been good,1
You charge a fee for EVERYTHING,"I already paid the rent bucks for the month so I wouldn't have to keep paying everytime I load my card but yet every single time it costs me 6,00 bucks to load it.  I'm really thinking about getting rid of this card",3
The overdraft isn't what I expected‚Ä¶,My account was compromised and I had to get a new card. The entire process was absolutely ridiculous and I was on the phone several times for over 4 hours total and had to call 3 times just to get card ordered. Tried to send in documents to be able to transfer money to my other netspend account and still has yet to be approved. Last thing I sent was a copy of my pay stub. I sent the entire copy and you keep asking me to send the rest of the page. I sent the entire damn piece of paper. And still can‚Äôt transfer money. It‚Äôs ridiculous and I am switching to another online account as soon as I can get everything switched. Way too hard to deal with you people!!!!!!,4
I love my Netspend card,Have been using netspend for years have no complaints,4

Good,"I contacted your call center to get my money put onto my visa card but the girl argued with me, she wanted to charge me 4.90 to put my money from my net  spend Mastercard to NetSpend visa now I had to use my Mastercard at the beginning of the month to pay my bills because my old visa I had to turn off because people were taking money off of it without my permission so I tried to get my money put onto my visa card and all she would do is argue with me i asked to talk to her supervisor and she refused to get them you need to fire this girl for being so rude",5
It's good I like it and the direct pay‚Ä¶,NetSpend is for people that can trust them and they can support them as far as making sure that their money is there two days ahead I like that and I'm sure other people do too I will pass this on to my family,5

charged 1.50 everytime you use the‚Ä¶,"I‚Äôm unhappy with these transactional fee‚Äôs! Called in to get assistance and I was told by a (Rain, Reign, Rhen) whatever her name is that I should‚Äôve activated my card with a representative rather than online and the rep would‚Äôve told me about the promo. When I called in on 6/6 a representative did in fact activate my card because my funds wouldn‚Äôt come up as available in the app after pending a few days then disappeared! He never mentioned signing up for a different promo to only pay a monthly fee. Needing to pay you to allow me to use my own money is insane. I‚Äôm trusting you to hold it and keep it available to me and you‚Äôre charging me a few to use my own hard earned funds. That‚Äôs mind blowing that you would get over on your customers like that. It‚Äôs greedy!! I‚Äôll definitely be removing my funds and ending any future usage.",4

I was in the market for a direct‚Ä¶,"Y'all charge for EVERYTHING!  Everytime card is used... FEES add up & no $ left... DO BETTER NETSPEND!! It's only a basic loadable card... usable card..I've reached out a few times by phone to Netspend & seems that the representatives don't understand the ""card options"", I was put on hold for 37 minutes! & NO resolution!  I have lost so much money using this card. I Do NOT recommend this NetSpend card ...   $1.95for EVERY use.  Ridiculous!!! (I was mislead & misinformed when I agreed to this card!)I was supposed to have been signed up for a monthly fee of $9.95 NOT $1.95 for every swipe!  Y'all have stole 45.00 from me.. & I finally spoke to a rep & she stated only $20 can be refunded BUT! $9.95 will be taken from that $20!  THIS IS FRAUD! & Netspend was NOT authorized to switch my card plan to being charged for every swipe!  And when I ask for a manager, these incompetent reps say ""I'm transferring you now.."" BUT! Hang up on me!  This company is a JOKE!",5
Great üëçüèΩ,I don‚Äôt like the extra fee you guys take out I couldn‚Äôt even put $5 in my tank because of the fee y‚Äôall have please take them off,5

I have three account with them and I‚Ä¶,I have used Netspend for years and I have never had a bad experience with them. I do wish they clearly stated that upgrading your account also meant that your current account number and cards would immediately be canceled and turned off when you upgraded.

Thank you for not cancelling my direct deposit though whewwww,5

If Netspend don‚Äôt refund me my money I‚Äôm taking further legal actions against Netspend and I‚Äôll make sure that Netspend goes bankrupt out of business and all of the employees loses their jobs.

I like how easy to load money on it,I don‚Äôt like the extra charges that NetSpend has with these cards. You need more ATMS to get money out without an extra fee to be charged on top of everything else.,5

Early access,"I like the card, it does me good üëç",1
Too many fees.,Did not know that I was charged a tax for my purchases. Not really helping me with my money and paying my bills. Would be best if NetSpend was a actual bank!!! Because when I have broke to pay the services put a hurt on my money that I work so hard to make.,5
I love my Netflix God Bless U All Madea‚Ä¶,Excellent service!!! Outstanding debit card...hassle free and excellent overdraft privileges.,2

Rating yall a three don't know why you‚Ä¶,The only thing is you charge too much to put money on it,4
My netspend card was declined for 2‚Ä¶,You haven't sent me a alert on my deposit every week,3
Grate,When I take money off of my card it's more money coming off of my card than it supposed to be,1
Great service,I had to call 4 times to get my questions answered. I spoke to 4 operator and 3 of them hung up probably cuz they couldn't answer my questions..Finally on the 4 call I got some of it taken care of..I am beginning to rethink why I changed my acct to netspend from direct express.,5
Just couldn't make Wire transfers,Honestly never had any issues or problems with Netspend.,5
Random charges without being used,The app is slow especially when login however its awesome,4
Netspend is horrible when my cousin‚Ä¶,I have direct deposit from my job where I‚Äôm a waitress so I don‚Äôt get paid the minimum amount opted for overdraft. My card was declined for an important bill and it was only for $.075. I was so embarrassed and am now looking for another card to have my paychecks deposited into.,1
bank,I think your fees are stupid high.  I threw the card away and will tell every one not to buy load or use the junkie ass card.,1
Love net spend,They were there when I needed them the most,5
I'm waiting on a payment,"Initially I had two (2) Netspend accounts that I wanted to change to Netspend All Access, but I was informed that the accounts were not in that program. Based on the required deposits required to get Netspend All Access my accounts qualified. I called the service representatives and I was informed to go to Netspend All Access and request the cards. What I wasn't told not to do, is to log into my account and apply for the cards.  Doing it that way rather than apply for the cards like a new customer, created a whole lot of problems. The cards couldn't be loaded, and two new cards had to be sent to me. It took almost a month to straighten the situation and I still had a problem with one of the two new cards just recently (05/31/2022). I couldn't load approximately $325.00 unto my card. Error message: ""ELECTRONIC CARD NOT ACTIVATED"". This were the same error messages I initially received from various locations, in different cities. Bottom line? Have representatives query the customers to ensure that the customers are going/sent to the proper links.  Improve the quality of the cards. It's difficult to read the card numbers. Improve how many times you can make ATM withdrawals from assigned ATM locations without fees (at least 3/4 times) a month.  On the positive side, once the card is functioning most transactions are quite simple.",5
I love it,"Fees, fees, fees. But functions as advertised",4
Still no Answer from the support,Thanks for your card it is great I use it to pay all my bills,5
I don't like how.this company operates,Its fast and easy to reload and use its so easy,1
I ordered a new card,I gave 3 stars because im still waiting on my money that someone charged to my card other than that i love netspend,1
Great deals !!!,I found it to be easy to set up and understand the features that I wanted.,4
Need a credit card,"So far, so good. Fees are a bit high but, hey, everything seems to be going higher now. Ease of use is crucial for me Excellent in that category. Update: my account has been breached!A pending investigation is ongoing, I've been told...",5
thanks its good type,Great review love the option of pay as u go and monthly. I love my netspend card,4
How bout faster and quicker response‚Ä¶,All good they did what they said they do,5
Very pleased,Back a couple yrs ago. The fraudulent  department  let Amazon withdraw 3 or 4 transactions  in a row for a small amount unsure exact amount  it was like under 2.00 each withdrawal  but I never EVER.   ORDERED  ANYTHING  FROM. AMAZON.    EVER.    AND I was never reimbursed  every. From. It either.  And then.  Some company  requested 1 dollar for the free credit. And that made me overdrawn  for 2 dollars.  For the longest time.  As this is  the only bank account  I have now.,2
So far so good I have had no issues!!,The service with this card has been wonderful!,5
This card really sucks balls,"Happy with my choice now that my husband and I know how to transfer from our bank onto my debit card with Netspend and have it show up within mins.  The first deposit that we made after actually receiving the card was done as a normal transfer using the account & routing number and took almost a week to show up.  So frustrated and thought we had made a terrible mistake.  When my card arrived , I was very sick and actually was in the hospital with pneumonia and activating the card was at the bottom of my list.  Now with things being somewhat normal again, I am thankful for the choice we made.",5
Love my account,It did not take long to get the card I have yet to get money putt on my card but I will have my disability put on it July the 3 ed,1
One of the worst worst prepaid card I‚Ä¶,Love it and would tell my friends and family about it.,5
Netspend has really helped me in alot‚Ä¶,"Love it, best card",1
It's al good.,I really like this netspend. Getting your check 2 days early really helps.  But they charge you 2.95 every time u draw money out on top of the ATM fee. It seems great so far though,5

Only issue i have is the $1.50‚Ä¶,Great  company early payday,5
Great to bank with!!,I am very displeased because of the service charges no ..2.25 or 2.50 just to take $$ out of your own,4
Netspend never paid me my money that was deposited to their card,No need to unless someone contacts me for disputes and puts my money back on there it's going in trash,5

Fees are ultimately what caused me to‚Ä¶,I would not recommend this card to anyone they charge 1.95 every time you use the card on top of whatever other fees there are ..it's a big ripoff.update..when I ordered this card I was unaware of this 1.95 fee otherwise I would never of gotten it .I have almost four hundred dollars in fees for less than 30days .I've never heard of a pay as you go debit card but now that I have I can assure you I will not only avoid NetSpend but warn as many potential victims as possible ..you might have gotten me for a few hundred but I assure you this will cost you more in the long run than it cost me ..who in their right mind would willingly sign up for a card that charges two dollars per transaction..your greed is pretty blatant right there don't you think,1
I never got my reward for refer a‚Ä¶,"I have had an active account with you for about a year. Anytime I have had issues your organization had handled my issues very professional and very prompt.

I love the service I recommend everyone‚Ä¶,Charges a 1.50 fee for every little purchase,5

Thanks,I tried every pre paid bank & this is the best one I've found. The All Access card is honestly a life saver!! Definitely recommend!!,2
Works well for an online bank,"I don‚Äôt like that I get charged $1.50 every time I use my card. And I can‚Äôt upload any of my checks via the mobile Netspend app, because it won‚Äôt let me. Those are really my only two complaints.",3

Makes 0 Sense,Excellent service,5
I don't have anything bad to say about‚Ä¶,I have had excellent experience with Netspend.Awsome job u guys.,1
Always some reason transactions don't‚Ä¶,It's convenient to have the card. I was just disappointed in the fee structure.Paying fees for every purchase cuts into your balance,5
Direct Deposit not on time as it was told,My only concern is why I have received notifications/alerts of purchase the following day.The concern being if it isn‚Äôt my purchase then the item will be paid and I will be without the funds while disputing the charge!,1
I like it,doing good and likeing the security u have so keep up the good work,3
No complaints  good and courteous‚Ä¶,"Their customer service is by far the worst customer service I've ever experienced,  except for Credit Karma money.They go hand in hand actually. Horrible manners,they fight with you, ignore you, hang up on you, refuse transferring you to their superior, make fun of you, laugh at you, mock you, talk over you qnd interrupt you all in a 4 min and 21 second call. They want to keep your money,  they will tell you they cannot verify you and hang up. They lie about what they can and cannot do and try to trick you into believing they cannot dispute certain charges or reimburse you sometimes. I have had it if they would let me I'd close every account I've ever had with them.boooo netspend I HATE YOU",4
I love my card,Awesome Card I love it,4
Stole $10 from me,Easiest way to bank online. Simple and straightforward.,5

I love my NetSpend account!,Love the business and service. Thanks!!!!,5
Safe with NetSpend,Was easy to sign up for and activation was easy.  I loaded my card with cash and used it right away.  Great service!,5
The app is good so far.,Personally I feel the terms and conditions should be clear on the fees for pin and signature purchase.   They way I read it was not the way it happen not did they follow dd fees they said..$1.50 was charged to just use my card in any manner... and that's just not cool.,5
Love it.,There are way too many fees.  Big scam,5

I told them several times that I was not a new customer and that I just wanted to let them know that the card had been  activated and to transfer any funds from the old card. I still get messages to activate my card",3
I wish that netspend could be better,"The customer service was great, and the staff were responsive to my requests. My inquiries were satisfied in a timely manner.",5

Good service,As a customer I think that we should have access to our money whenever we need it no matter whether we have the car or not as long as we have our banking info as far as the routing and account number that should be sufficient enough it's bad enough that we have to pay ATM fees and fees for you guys every month.,5

Love it love it love it,"i am please thus far, thank you!",5
It's decent when you are unable to use a bank,Oh I have been with NetSpend I want to say for about 15 years I truly like it better than having a checking or savings account honestly most companies do yes offer up to 3 days early pay however I just decided to put my VA pension on direct deposit and I got paid over a week early and when NetSpend noticed that my account has been or is being compromised they immediately stop all transactions and have no problem replacing any funds that were compromised out of my account they immediately replaced it if I go over let's say $5 they have covered me and waited for money to be added to the account I have Master card and Visa with NetSpend I highly recommend it I have recommended to several people co-workers family members and to my knowledge the ones that I'm still in contact with are still with NetSpend thank you,5
I've told all my friends about all that‚Ä¶,I love having my money 2 days early and getting my notifications,3
Net spend is a good way to receive your‚Ä¶,1.50 per transaction? And I'm not even told about the fee plan option upfront so I end up throwing away $50+... No thank you,5
It's great the only thing that I don't‚Ä¶,This card work good. Love this card,5
So far so good...,"There easy to use, no issues , besides some fees .",5
love the card,I've been a customer of netspend for over 10 years or longer in the beginning l was very pleased and satisfied with netspend but over the last 2 and half years my card has been compromised at least 3 times in one year.  Each time my card was canceled and another one sent out to me being unable to use my funds until another card came to me in the mail and this process always took two weeks or longer.  I know had netspend operated as a regular bank l would not have gone through this repeat.  What l don't understand how is it happening at least 8 times.  Each card is a new card and this should not be happening the way that it has since 2020. The last time that it happened was this year and I received a new card in the mail even before it was comprehensive again.  So currently I am very unhappy because I have to notify every creditors giving them my new card number.  Eventually in a couple of months I am just transferring to a bank.  I'm sorry but netspend is not how it was when I joined.,4
I just wish disputing charges didn't‚Ä¶,"Good Service, easy to use mobile app good customer service real time assistance. I used this service for years would recommend trying out NetSpend money service's are great.",5
If I could give 0 I would this card‚Ä¶,Very good company. I have never had a problem with them,4
Netspend,I never really had issues I have had netspend for 14yrs I had one issue I don't want to go through the story,1
Great service,I like NetSpend becuz of the upgrade to all access no fees except to atm and swiping and getting deposits on it are a breezy except the 15$ that's still pending.keep it up,5
Charge too much to get ur own money‚Ä¶,I normally go with my bank mobile but I wanted to have two separate accounts one for my social security checks which is netspend. And wit my school account.  I have not had any problems with netspend. Keep up the good work.,5
Netspend is a decent debit card company‚Ä¶,"Received my first paycheck and it was hand written. The check was unable to be deposited. So, I will open a bank account and I plan never to use Netspend again.I was advised to contact them directly and after three messages no reply was given to my inquiry. Again, you took the spriest stimulus and denial of the second one makes no sense whatsoever. Poor customer service. I will never recommend using Netspend.",1
"Love it very reliable,,,wish that it‚Ä¶",I have not experienced any problems with NetSpend. All the transactions and everything are correct and working perfectly a NetSpend is doing a great job üëç,3
Total Scam!!!!  Beware!!!!,I am very satisfied with my new all access net spend debit card. I received my direct deposit a week before time. You can‚Äôt ask for a better bank. I‚Äôm glad I join net spend a year ago. Thank you net spend.,5
Service awesome,I love it keep doing what y'all doing and keep going up,1
NetSpend is good so far.,I don't appreciate you taking my money  I set up and account for securus tec  so my son could call me  $30.00,5
U crooks will burn in hell,They charge you way too much every time you use the card. I had 16.05 and put the card in the pump at the gas station and was able given 14.10 in gas. I would rather use Venmo than this place,5
I like the card but why charge a fee‚Ä¶,Netspend is a good way to bank and use for direct deposit for your checks arriving earlier.,1
Refill rate is outrageous!,The amounts able for bank transfers is so random. Amounts make no sense and are so small. When I reached out to the customer service email I received no response.,4
Hello,They are great I've only had q couple problems but not bad problems,3
Very reliable,"I uploaded my check (1 minute quick and easy), no fee, only waited a few business days (not 10 like expected). Money in my account simple and hassle-free!",5
I have had no problems with Netspend‚Ä¶,Okay     Okay  okay,5
Very very good.,I love to getting the money two to three days earlier thank you NetSpend I'm referring you to everyone I know,5
I was very satisfied with netspend,I give netspend a one star because someone stole my money and its been a month and still haven‚Äôt recover my funds.,5
Worst service,I'm charged every time I use my card. It's not good. In this economy I need My money as much as possible,5
Happy customer,Had the card for about 2 years now. Good service love just checking my account on the website. Get my money early. Don't think I've ever even had to call customer service or had any real issues.,1
Horrible service,I think NetSpend is wonderful when it comes to overdraft protection because it really helps in the time of need!,5
So far.So good.,So far have absolutely not complaints. You are doing good job. Lot better than Account Now or Green Dot.RW,1

Had a very good experience,Got one of these stupid cards from my job for winning some contest and it has been absolute hell trying to get it activated. They sent me to their fraud department then I call the department and they tell me there‚Äôs no fraud concern‚Ä¶. Why send me there? Now I‚Äôm being sent to ANOTHER person to hopefully activate and this this god forsaken $20. You effectively need to open an entire bank account with these people and you can‚Äôt even use the card for ATM or account transfers. Why would I want to pour money into a card that I can‚Äôt use on my own terms? This is insane nonsense. Luckily I‚Äôm leadership and told the company to never buy this nonsense again so people don‚Äôt need to go through this next year.,5
It's been quite easy to use,"My objectives were always achieved, and always with excellent customer service.",4
Good you should try it.,I would give a higher rating if not for high price to use,5

I like NetSpend because you get‚Ä¶,"Netspend has homework to do before it can call itself a financial institution. I have list over $1400 to neglect security practices by this company and customer service needs drastic improvements when it comes to addressing these matters. Customer satisfaction should come first but if not, how are you in business?",4
Awesomeness,I don't like that they charge a $5 monthly fee.,4
why do you have to PAY to do anything‚Ä¶,"I've been a customer of NetSpend for over 2 months and I really like the company,no problem over here",5
Netspend Review,"WORST PREPAID CARD EVER!!!  It seems like over the years, netspend has gotten worse with their customer service representatives. They've also been even less helpful when your card has been compromised allowing thieves to run off with your money in cities miles aways and won't even help you retrieve your funds.  They also have the audacity to want you to resubmit direct deposit information after sending you new card with the updated account claiming the cards are not compatible with existing account.  You guys are FRAUDS!!!!",3
They got everything perfect,I like the facts that you have different  locations  to load your money on your card.Some locations  are 24 hours a day 7 days a week. That makes life in general  much easier. From paying  household  Bill's. To shopping  online.  To buying gas food shopping  Etc.The service  fees is a little high. Since most of the country called United states  of America.  Is open for business  again with the high inflation on everything If the service fee was lower it would of 5 star ratingThank you,3
Decent easy fast!!,Loving my card cause I get paid 2 days before pay day,5
Surprisingly  netspend did well with‚Ä¶,The customer service experience is positive. I usually can get my issue resolved on the first phone call. I think Netspend does extra to protect people accounts and deter fraudulent actions on accounts. I wish the fees were a little lower.,5
I did everything you asked and you‚Ä¶,I love my Netspend Card.  It makes everything so much easier!  Thank you Netspend!!!,5
I had a stay at a hotel in Woodland‚Ä¶,"As a person who had different kinds of banking sources over the years (prepaid and checking at the same time), I have found myself being drawn to Netspend as my banking source after deciding to do with my checking account. Netspend has allowed me to be able to check my account much more easily than I have before. Would I recommend it over a checking account yes but it is not for everyone. Netspend so far has not only met but has exceeded my expectations.",1
I got great service on the phone,Great job with my needs and my money,2
Just horrible costumer service...SMH,Had excellent customer service.,3
Everything seems to be okay I just‚Ä¶,its all good no problem,1

I've been with NetSpend since 2013 I‚Ä¶,ALWAYS clear and collect my money for false advertising on a purchase.,5
I only have positive feedback‚Ä¶,I think NetSpend is a great card I don't really like bank accounts and NetSpend to save me out of got me out of a lot of jams for lately and I bought three escorts which is kind of cool and I took NetSpend thanks bye,5

I use my NetSpend all the time,They blocked my card and I expressed to them that my refund was coming on this card and the guy just said well ma'am you will have to call the IRS. Uncaring inconsiderate,5

There are too many banks,Very easy to use,5
Terrible worse,I did this because I did not realize I would be charged a fee for every transaction. Even an over the counter withdrawal from the bank. Not comfortable with all the fees!,3
Netspend always helps me right away‚Ä¶,I not to pleased of the 5.00 monthly charge or the charge of a dollar every time I use it. Plus the 3.50 to load it. The bottom line is it should not cost anything to keep my money on this card,1
Proud member of NetSpend all access,"There are a variety of benefits associated with Net Spend All-Access card. I am so happy with this debit card, and I really appreciate the services Net Spend offers. You can use this card when shopping in the United States and even some countries. The fees associated with the Net Spend All-Access card are reasonable, and there is no credit check required to open an account. If I could give this company 1,000 stars, I would. I highly recommend a Net Spend card to anyone.",5
No comment,"There's no wordy, NETSPEND IS THE BEST.",5
Everything is fine only thing couldn't‚Ä¶,"I had a charge of $200 on my card for a hotel room that I was unfamiliar with. I contacted Netspend and they created a dispute for me, however they said I would take 10 business days for them to credit the account with the stolen money, and as of yet it still has not been credited, nor does it show that it is being disputed. It‚Äôs bd enough for someone to steal your money. But Netspend should have already credited my account with the loss. I‚Äôm frustrated by their lack of support or assistance",2

Awesome job,"I have explained myself over and over and you don't listen or seem to care . You have been holding on to my money for a week and a half or two or something like that because it was put in the wrong account my direct deposit has been put in the wrong account which is an all access account that I never created never wanted and it's been kept pushing on me and pushing them in y'all have every time talk to you emails and all that told you know I don't want it so I guess you gave up trying with me and then tried to blame it on my  employer and say they put it in the wrong account which they did not because they've been using the same account number since I started there and didn't have a problem so you finally got your way in now I can't even get my money to use it I've had to miss work because of it which cost me $1,300 this week so add that to the $1,800 that you're not letting me access to and I can't understand why that if what you say the employer did it that count is not activated how in the hell can there be money put in it when I never open that account so y'all had to but y'all say it's inactive and I can't touch it but I didn't open it Don't bother send it to my regular card which I have proof of that and all my tech stuff biggest damn scam I've ever seen it's the second time this year that's happened with when y'all want to be banks cuz you're not banks I can't talk to the same person twice in a row or twice at all I got to explain myself every single time I call forgot a problem I got a start over every time and explain the whole situation again that is so unprofessional and low class it's unbelievable other than that Y'all been great . You found a way to hold on to my money into an account that don't even exist and should not and all even have my name attached to it I don't know how y'all did that at the end house job quit blaming it on my lawyer and damn sure can't blame me for not wanting to do anything except for car lawyer and call it FBI which I will not give no money back to me it should have been transferred to my other account that I've been using the whole time but for some reason all those are dead on it well that that wouldn't be there it's the money when it went to my direct deposit like it usually does and it would prevented that fee from getting there so now you're trying to make me pay that and still not get my money sounds awful lot like some serious criminal activity so we'll let the FBI and them big into your privacy and I will tell thousands of people I live in over a 3 million populated city and I've been here 35 years so I know a lot of people I will spread the word on this and all over the internet and whatever else I got to do You can't treat people like you have I was a good customer would have stayed a good customer and you have done this cost me a lot of money couldn't go to work and can't even get the money I did work for and then blame it on my employer That's really sad",5

I ordered a all access card now they‚Ä¶,I just open my account and my first transaction I have a dispute and my funds aren't available I'd like a temporary credit,4
Honest  is so cool ‚ù§,Netspend's best feature is immediately giving you a balance when money is spent or credited back to your account. I am anticipating that the fee stays steady and does not increase in the future financial climate.,3
Your technician did a great job help me,Very good and helpful,4
NetSpend has been Great,I'm trying to locate my Tax refund and you guys don't have any record of it..,5

I really like the Netspend All Access‚Ä¶,"I recently loaded cash onto my netspend card, a card that I received  over a year ago. However it is a card which I had not even used up to this point. A day or so after loading my money onto said card I attempted to make a purchase  online. The purchase was declined and  a lock was placed on my card. I understand why as this has occurred in the past  and been  categorized as "" possible spending outside of my normal  spending pattern "" However, this is normally remedied by myself answering a couple questions and furnishing certain  account information and the lock is lifted. No problem. This time I was told to send a photo of my id,ID, social security card or birth certificate and proof of address for which I sent in a photo of a recent bill sent to  my current address  which differs from the address used when I  registered for this card. This document However was not approved  . Not sure of the reason. I have  since sent in several other documents (to include...my birth certificate, past paystubbs with my old address, w2 forms,all not approved. Customer service informs me that it must be a document with the address with which I registered the account which is my OLD address which  I  no longer reside at as like I said earlier, I moved to my current address over a year ago  and I was told that it has to be a document that I have received within the last 30 days.  How am I supposed to send you a photo of a document with that (the old) address that was issued within the last 30 days when I have not lived there or received mail there in over a year because I  MOVED? I was then told that the only other option is to close the account and I would be  sent a refund check which would be mailed to the address that is registered to my account....lol  yeah the address I moved out of  over a year ago. Why would you send my refund to my old address where I no longer live as opposed to my current address? Why (with  all of the  documents that I  have ALREADY sent) can't the lock be lifted like before? Why am I having to jump through all these hoops just to get MY OWN money?",3
NetSpend help me when I needed money‚Ä¶,"Honest people, very dog respect",5
Good company to do business ‚Ä¶,I like this card because it doesn‚Äôt take long for funds to be available after loading money on it. What I dislike is the fee I get charged every time I use it.,5
Very happy,"I NETSPEND ACCOUNT ON THE INTERNET I TRY TO SET UP AN ACCT ON THE INTERNET BECAUSE I DON'T OWN A SMARTPHONE OR ANY CELL PHONE I WANTED TO JOIN THE $10 WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY A $1.50 FOR EVERY PURCHASE & SO FAR I HAVE NOT GOT ANY HELP WHAT SO EVER.

Been with Netspend for over 19 years great company,"I've been trying to get help,on some issues and no one have been responding iam thinking to close that account",5

Great so far,"i like the card features , like getting paid two day's early is always Great! Setting up the card was very easy. Thanks Netspend",5
Pleased with your service,"I had fraudulent use of my card and I immediately called in to customer services to report these fraudulently charges , I was not able to stop these transactions even doe the charges where still pending. I called literally less then 10 minutes from wen these transactions where made.",5
I like netspend and help me  but I‚Ä¶,"I've had a NetSpend card for a while, but I had to reorder one. I chose the color a pink! I absolutely love it üíï it's easy to use anywhere, especially online purchases.",4
Everything is good,So far it's been good easy to use easy to load haven't had any problems so I'm happy,4
My card,Your card sucks . No where in the statement did it say I would be charged as much as 3dollars for using the card to access my money . I truely feel it's just a way for you all to screw the working people over .,5
Good Customer Service,Quite honestly I'm quite disaffected satisfied with your service it takes forever for the money to load on a machine you charge $2 95 per Friends Action not mentioning how much it cost to load the cards in the first place because he must strive grief and almost cost me someone flying home from Fort Lauderdale so now I don't care for your card one B quite honest with you,5
Usage cost is a lot,"I would give you 0 if I could. My account, several different cards have been ""compromised"" and had to be replaced. The netspend app is a joke. It never works correctly. You website the same. Can only see one card a time. I actually currently locked out of most of my accounts, because idk, locked the ones that dohave money ofcoure. I tried to get someone to call me and help me as the customer ser reps just hang up on me because they dont understand what i am saying! AND..... I actually paid more money to ammend my federal taxes and refile. Originally, the were set to be direct deposited into a NetSpend account like last time, but I thought I will be damned if that's going happen since nobody would help me straighten stuff out, too many compromised cards!And one card had to replaced after someone helped them self to my money TWICE!  SO replace card and had returned stuff Amazon, they reverserd back to a inactive account no money it  just there?!The only money I can see as a balance on line doesn't have a card hmmmmmmm??????",4
NetSpend is really great except for‚Ä¶,It was pretty simple i went to the local Dollar General and had money added to my card and after 30 minutes it was available for use.,4

They take out $2 dollars for every‚Ä¶,I put bad because when I added money to pay for something on Amazon my payment didn‚Äôt go through,5
It‚Äôs ok,Because you charge to deposit money into my card. And the fee I was charged was $5.95. It‚Äôs my money I‚Äôm spending it‚Äôs not like you are giving people the money to spend. It‚Äôs their own money and you charge people to deposit and spend their own money. I will not use the card again,1

Your customer service sucks,I hate all them extra fee and take to long to transfer money I hate Netspend,5
I am very new to NetSpend but so far it‚Ä¶,Net spend leaves out the part where they charge you to spend your hard earned money that you already paid them to load onto the card . Which is rather ridiculous when paying bills. Or when giving to a teen as their first time card .,5
I'll be canceling my card,"Great,  made it so easy",5
Easy to use many load locations,I was skeptical but I get real time updates of what's in my account. I get my direct deposit two days early and a text when money is added/debited from my account. Fantastic job Netspend!!!!!!!!!,1

Charging a 2.00 fee each purchase a‚Ä¶,"I don't think that I should be charged every single time that I make a debit card purchase. I understand am ATM fee, but not when I use the debit/credit card machine in a checkout line at a store.",5
Great Great Service,I like the text for account balance on each transaction,1
I appreciate you guys canceling my card‚Ä¶,We shouldn't have to pay you $5 a month to use our money or $1.50 a transaction.  That's highway robbery.,5
You did very well,"This is Netspend, where I get my expectations met and my business is accomplished professionally!!!",1
I need help and they won't help,Top Notch must I say any more,5
The best,I love üíó that I get my paycheck 2days early. Helps so much. Thx Netspend,2
All i can say is Awesome,"The fee is extremely high , wouldn‚Äôt recommend it",5
It works for what i need it for so‚Ä¶,They charge to add money to the card and then charge a fee per transaction to use the money on the card! Unless you qualify for and pay a monthly service fee! I have 3 other cards that do not charge any fees and only 1 of those charges a fee to load cash onto it. I will never use this card again! It is already cut up and shredded and account canceled. I highly do NOT recommend! Especially when there are so many free options!,5
This card is great my deposit is done‚Ä¶,The only thing I don‚Äôt like is it cost 1.50 for every transaction,4
I am completely satisfied with my‚Ä¶,Don't get this card you will lose money with every purchase! They charge you a fee to use this card and they charge you to put money on it.,5

I hate netspend tax to hard I'm leaving,I absolutely love netspend all-acess and being able to immediatly transfer funds to other netspend users and cards with flash pay it is so simple also the over draft and protection is reasonable plus they offer a savings account as well as being able to fund your netspend card at many locations direct deposit and through other transfering services,5

Very good,"Customer service is good. When my card number was stolen, you stopped the transaction, and I had my new card in 3 days! I am very pleased with your service.",5
I have to pay 150 everytime,SO far no complaints except I wasn't aware that you have to pay a 5 dollar fee a month just to use the card which kinda sucks we're already charged for alot of the things we do with the card so I don't think it's right to pay 5 bucks just to use it every month but so far nothing has gone wrong so I guess that's my only complaint,5
Everytime I try to use the card it‚Ä¶,The service is excellent. The customer service representatives are informative.,1
The card is very user-friendly and easy‚Ä¶,The limit is only $500 i wish it could be higher i pay bills with my card and most of the time they exceed my limit on loading.,1

I enjoy the early direct deposit and‚Ä¶,I am still waiting on my $240.00 that I filed the paperwork on. How long do I have wait?,5
Haven't had any issues,I‚Äôm unable to send more then $100.00 anywhere I choose and the fee to send money is to high.,5
Great service,Nice card I would recommend,3
Good,Great experience thank you but not a fan of the increase in prices,5
I have a question,To tell the truth a overall job they get it done  but to get us payed about our life and identity  and financial  it's a bomber,5

Good  card,Great card service,5
They're great at everything!!,Iam well pleased with netspend service,5
Good,"My experience has been disappointing for the following reasons:1)  Now, I cannot get into my online account. My username and password are correct.  The login keeps kicking me out because my session has exceeded the time limit.  I have not even entered into the account!!2) Initially, I was able to get into my account and set up my notifications, after that was completed, each time I logged in, there would be a new option to set up that needed to be completed, I didn't want to set up, so I selected no and the system kicked me out!3) Since I could not login online, I went the phone call route.  I attempted 6 times to go in. Each time, the system would hang up on me. On the 7th time, i waited for the operator to complete their sentences, completed their instructions then I entered my information very slowly and carefully to finally get through. 4) The reason I was calling was because there was a transaction I received from my notification on a debit from Walmart for $98.  I called to dispute that transaction.  They blocked my card, but I was told I would not get $98 back until the occurrence was confirmed!!  A bank will refund the amount back on the same day and they will investigate in the meantime to confirm there was fraud.5) The only reason I chose to try this card, was because of the early deposits into my account.  The above 4 reasons, are weighing heavily on looking to returning to a regular bank.",5
That only if I could use you on cashapp,Thanks you all have really made things alot easier on me!,5
Very satisfied with Netspend,Automatic phone system,5
Love that I‚Äôm able to receive my check‚Ä¶,Using Netspend has helped me alot in recieving my payroll two days early  when you live from check to check getting your paycheck in advance  like this helps out alot.,5

Netspend service,Your app is really slow to review it when you get on there to see what your balance is.,5

Just my opinion,Your policy about going forward with two cards is ridiculous if you already have a card just use the information from that card for your second card only one customer service person was able to help me after calling 3 days in a row to get my money off my new card rude and wouldn't let me talk the last gentleman that helped me was the best and I hope you find out who that is and give him a raise,4
Everything I needed to pay NetSpend‚Ä¶,To many fees from ATM to purchasing items at the register.,3
Netspend has been an absolute dream and‚Ä¶,It sucks that you charge $1.50 everything I use my card. Looking to get rid of this card very soon. Applying for other cards.,5
The all around service was great.,I've been using Netspend for almost a decade.  Never had any issues with fees being added.  My money is always right.  I'm very satisfied and will continue to use Netspend in the future.,5
Awesome job I like NetSpend it took me‚Ä¶,Love it . Can use this everyday . worked out with ease,5
Love it,You helped me get my money back from Amazon  they were taking money that didn't belong to them and I was very happy to have someone stand up for me thank you.,5
I love this car thank you so much,"I have been with NetSpend for a good time now. The only complaint I have is the fees. I get charged to use ATMs, their fees and your fees. I'm loosing money that I've worked hard for. Need a way to be able to get cash without 2-3 different ""people"" getting paid by me. Thank you",5
Good job help you explain things,"I have never used NetSpend. I used Green Dot. Even though Iam upset with Green Dot because they didn't give my rewards yet. I received an unusual message from NetSpend when I called and press 1  , they illegally activated a card I have never used before ending in 6039. The NetSpend portal refused to give me access to this card after I entered the pertinent information in hopes that I could proceed with the deactivation. I don't know what new scam this is but please don't involve me. I do not use your products and services. Iam pro Green Dot all day. Thank you. I think the professional way to handle this is to respond to the email I sent you all at customerservice@netspend. Com Have a good day!!!!Talitha Madlock",5
I would like my money refunded !!!,"NetSpend is very useful and is easy for me to transfer money online, buy things online and easy to use",5
I think you do a real good job,"Great card, thanks so much for the update",1

Poor poor customer service reps they're‚Ä¶,"When I received my netspend all access card. I was having trouble activating it. Being I am 60 yrs old and not very savvy at working my way around my cell phone. A very professional, courteous an patient customer service representative. Walked me through the process.",5
They charge you for EVERY transaction,"Overall, I like the services provided by the card, but on 2 occasions I was denied using it for purchases when there was plenty of money on the card to cover it. Also, I was not aware of the $5.00 monthly charge, but I did not have all the paperwork still when I received the card, it got thrown away....",1

I‚Äôm unhappy with these transactional‚Ä¶,Just take any NORMAL regular bank and please try to make the same thing but bring more innovations (that are actually respond to the people unsatisfied needs)...just that will be enough for giving people the opportunity to take you seriously... Trapping people in the middle of your procedures and policies is from another age... honestly! #SomeoneThatCanStillBeWithoutYou.#NowCanYouBeWithManyPeopleLikeMe?,5

I just love it,I called to report Unauthorized charges on my card. They opened a dispute and then completely canceled my account and I can no longer make an account and still having some money on the card. So now I have to wait u til they determine if I do get a refund and if I do they‚Äôll send my money in a check. Like wow smh. Netspend üëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèº And they charge for every transaction $1.50.,5
I am very grateful and happy with this‚Ä¶,I do not like the fact that if you lose your card you get another account and routing number unbelievable you have to pay 4.95 to transfer and they have a limit on how much you can transfer.   I spent a lot of 4.95 transfer.    They know your account is closed so why can not add to the new account and the new card?    Very unhappy with Netspend after being with them for over 5 years well good by Netspend   I will be closing my account after the 10 of May.,3
Y'all charge for EVERYTHING,Used it long time now . Luv it and everywhere accepts it...,5
I don‚Äôt like the extra fee you guys‚Ä¶,Great way to keep track with your spending.,1
It excellent and I would recommend‚Ä¶,I signed up for overdraft but it didn't work on line could you please check this for me thank you,2
I don't like $1.95 fees,Your company charges money to add money to the card and then you charge money every time you use it for a purchase it‚Äôs a rip off and I‚Äôll never use it again and I will recommend anybody that I know never use it again,5
Love netspend,"Went to go set up my account on the app. Got my card activated, went back to the app. It kept saying that my email, my password was wrong, even though I know what username password I put in thanks. Net spend. Now I have to call every time I want to know my balance.",2

I have used Netspend for years and I‚Ä¶,My reasons for this review and 2star review. Is because I recently had my card stole. Purchase went through that were not approved or authorized.

I was not told I needed to do a letter of dispute it‚Äôs been over a month already I should have gotten my money back. So it like telling the people that took the card that it was ok. When in fact it‚Äôs not,3
I really love NetSpend it helps me out‚Ä¶,I love netspend its easy to use and easy to top up your card.,5
Well I tried to get a dating site‚Ä¶,"I do like using my NetSpend card, I don't agree with being charged to use my own money everytime I make a purchase.

Thanks for your card it is great I use‚Ä¶,I love NetSpend and if you love me you will get NetSpend in your corner or by your side they're Fair honest and reliable NetSpend is the way to go trust me you will be glad you have them by your side good luck all your experiences with NetSpend I know you'll be happy,5
Good,Netspend is the best,5
I gave 3 stars because im still waiting‚Ä¶,To many fees and charges.,5
I found it to be easy to set up and‚Ä¶,Love it good app,3
To date....,Netspend is really good i never had a problem with them and I‚Äôll continue to be with them in the near future .,5
Love love love,Great fast customer service is friendly,5
Ain't worth nothing,Your a software company they come a dime a dozen but this once charges 5 dollars a month. Do I need to list your competition or hopefully you know who it is. I can think if some $1 a month and some free software companies backed by a bank. Sad this product is useless.,5
Not a good card to use period,Good customer service and easy with strong security and privacy to keep me and mine safe,1
Good service fast reliable,Need to be able to get daily spending limit  raised  at ATMs,1
Oh good he did what they said they do,"you say you sent a code for me to use so I can access  my account but it never came, six times!",5
Back a couple yrs ago,It was pretty easy to load and use my card but the fees are insane,5
Too many fees.,Good and easy to use,4
The service with this card has been‚Ä¶,I love my netspend card I get my money the next day,1
Thankful for joining Netspend!,"With NetSpend I've noticed right off the way they wanted to educate me right off the bat.  Without a building to walk into I had concerns, however those concerns were quickly swept away with the simple ways NetSpend educated me. I'm elderly and have health issues, making changes isn't easy, but I did find through NetSpend a very, positive experience.",5
It did not take long to get the card I‚Ä¶,NetSpend has been an invaluable resource for me. It has allowed me to get rid of credit cards and to better track my cash expenditures throughout the month. Easier to deal with without worrying about a bill and a ton of interest.,5
Love it,"I have had nothing but good experiences here, I had to close my local bank accounts due to not getting my pay checks on time , but so far so good.ThanksMelissa T. Rivas",4
Love it,Took money from my card without proper authorization,5
I really like this netspend,My netspend card and your operators were great. Thanks.,5
You guys are great and hard working and‚Ä¶,Not like it used to be. Disappointed I came back... Bank to a physical bank I go!,5
I've nothing but outstanding‚Ä¶,By far the best prepaid card I've had the pleasure of using. I never worry about my money with netspend.,5
Great service,It took a whole month to get a replacement card. That's too long to wait.  then a All Access Card arrives three days before my direct deposit was due.  You really need too work on that.,5
Well done.,One star is the lowest I could select or I would have gone even lower!!worst card experience straight rip off they charge you for everything atm fee to check balance fee if there ain‚Äôt enough money that your asking to pull out fee to use atm then a fee for atm not on the there approved atm list and you can pull out 1000 dollers only 200.00at a time so that like ten fees and I could go on an on,5
The reason I said is bad they charge‚Ä¶,"service has improved, during covid I waited 9 months to get a replacement card, now it was less than 2 weeks had to call to get the balance left on the old card  transferred to a new card that was trouble,I thought that money went into someones pocket",5
Costing me money eventide I use it,NetSpend app sucks can't get through to my account without having to call someone I should be able to reset my password on the app instead of telling me I have to call customer service,1
Thanks for your service,"So far, so good",1
Always excellent customer service‚Ä¶,Have nothing but good things to say about netspend.,4
Just excellent service,I couldn't be happier with this card I'm so glad to be rid of the rest Express you have no idea there was a little good first time I used it but it came like money posted four-day Ray Brewery which was great easy to use somebody answers the phone when you call them,5
Excellent customer service and support,I like NetSpend it is easy to use a dollar fifty for each transaction is very high you have to pay $4 to put money on your card and you have to pay for a replacement card where all the prepaid cards that I have used I would never recommend anyone to use NetSpend I just did because it was convenient laying around my house when I filed my tax return,5
Customer service,NetSpend as excellent customer service and and is timely in submitting responses to requests for transcripts I am pleased with the due diligence,5
Always ssend link to view statements‚Ä¶,Please  send a text every time I take money out my account,5
Great,It's ok. I think I might keep using it.,1
The extra fees,The app isn't really working for me. If that worked better I would be happier,5
Too many fees!!!,Love it !! .. no problem‚Äôs and don‚Äôt look at there ever being any üòä,3
Perfect,"Highly recommend netspend! The protection and piece of mind are great, they intercepted immediately when someone tried using my card ! I will always use netspend",2
Unhelpful and Uninformed,Fast and efficient. It would be great if I could get help as in a personal loan. I was a victim of identity theft and my main bank closed my accounts and still made me pay back money I didn't use or authorize,1
i have not had any problems yet so far‚Ä¶,Netspend gets my check early an thats help me out a lot.so good job for the help.,1
Prompt service,Made managing my funds easy with updates to SMS/texts to phone!!!!!,4
Excellent service,It's like having a real bank but a little bit better because of app the one and only thing I don't like are the little fees here and there but that's with any card,5
I have never had a problem with‚Ä¶,I have been trusting Netspend with my direct deposits and transactions for years and would recommend them for non-traditional banking needs.,5
Awesome,Omg this crap with this amount of this or that I almost said screw this review,5
Easy-to-use,My card was blocked and it took for ever for them to transfer my money to another card and poor customer service üò°,5
Well I have an issue with my card after‚Ä¶,Great Customer service and great we'll thought out app that works well. Only drawback is that it doesn't like to work behind a VPN.,5
Too expensive,Netspend is great I'm glad I joined  i just love the updated notice that I receives it keeps me a where of all my transactions,5
I like to use NetSpend for my online‚Ä¶,Never had any issues with my netspend card when making payments or loading money,1
Love love love it,I transferred money from pay pal to NetSpend and it took 24hrs. I was out of gas and needed to get home. I sat at the gas station til they credited my account.,5
I have had my share of prepaid cards‚Ä¶,Customer service is okay the company is mediocre at best.,5
No help at al,Great service thx,5
Netspend does a wonderful job,I really enjoy my Netspend account would never change,1
Can‚Äôt use my app,Too many fees and too high of fees but I have to deal with that I mean like really 3 dollars to use a ATM that's what you charge then if I use someone else's ATM they may charge on top of that plus I pay 10 dollars a month and don't get a break on these fees and I'm limited on how much I can take out a day so there is more fees to make multi withdraws,5
Thanks Netspend,It was fast and easy and everything went smoothly money was deposited on my card right away.,1
Thanks Netspend a lot if I didn‚Äôt have‚Ä¶,Very good bank. Had no problems what so ever. thanks netspend.,5

Very convenient üëå,I had deposited money to my card and it never showed up i cant speak with no1 im pretty much done with netspend,5
Easy quick App for me to use,This is a great card to use . My only problem with it is it will not let me send money to Venmo.,5
Too many fees!,It has been a great experience with this card on time and trusted!,5
Yall ok but ya'll  get on my nerves‚Ä¶,"This 5 star review is based on NetSpend All Access. I am very happy with my account and card. Honestly it is my favorite mobile banking app. I have never had an issue. I use this NetSpend All Access account to deposit my paychecks. Before being upgraded to the All Access, I was not very happy with my account because the fees for withdrawing from an atm AND a $1.50 fee for every transaction. I rarely used the card. The $5 monthly fee for All Access was very much worth it and kept me with NetSpend when I would not have.",1
Yall didn't respond when I contact y'all,"Really, open my account, look what you've done, n charged in me to transfer the money to the new account I had to open over a $7.91 shipping cost, you caused it, have everything screwed up, the trusty dept, it's, says my stimulus has been sent, where will we find this...",4
They charge fee for credit purchase‚Ä¶,I on understand what a monthly maintenance fee is for. And why it only gets charged to me after I have any funds in my account.,1
We are very satisfied with our‚Ä¶,Manage own Money. Direct deposit from irs to your job. I Recommend Netspend all access.  I pay all bills using this card. Everyone excepts Netspend and give cash back. Great for people who don't want the bank to over charge you.,1
Love it...,I am never disappointed when it comes to my card and its service,5
Corporate does assist consumers but you‚Ä¶,Account set up was simple and all transactions are very accurate,5
I love it cuz they'll let you see what‚Ä¶,I love the Security it immediately alerted me when I was signed in from an unknown device...,5
Wonderful customer service,Nice smooth system easy to use. Very convenient for me.,4
Always A 1.50 charge on everything on‚Ä¶,Awesome easy fast glad I used this company..,5
Very good customer service üëè üëå üëç,"Why have i never received cash back? Or 5% interest rate. Ive had serious issues with contacting yall. Im still NOT getting anytime alerts. Im considering  a different card now. I dont like being promised ANYTHING when it comes to my money. Im holding yall in the most trust worthy position in my world, but you dont keep your word? Thats a HUGE PROBLEM AND A PRIORITY for me to fix. For all i know yall are skimming a quarter  day. Over 2 years... ???? Seriously. Yall sure snatched up that monthy fee for the sevreal months i stopped using this card.  I dont trust netspend right now. Especially after my last deposit.",1
Awesome,I think it's a bunch of bull for people to be charged $ 1.50 everytime we make a purchase and be charged a reload fee on top of that.,5
Bla bla bla be ggd go,Awesome love this card,5
Very efficient way for me to keep track‚Ä¶,"Quick, Easy and Kind. God Bless",2
Well I rate NetSpend as very poor‚Ä¶,I love over draft help me pay rent in these trouble times,5

Great Card,No problems so far. Been happy with the service and timely manner that my deposits enter on my card.,5
Great card great service,"NetSpend is awesome!!!My direct deposit moved in so quickI get my pay a day prior now,üòäI was having hard time setting up direct deposit with another card wisely and they gave me hard timeI had to wait almost two weeksBecause I was having trouble uploading my documents, so thanks to NetSpend.I had no problem sending money throughIt's link with western union which cost less money to transfer the funds to another NetSpend holder  And yes it don't cost much it's free to sign up .",5

I really enjoy the Virtual Credit Card‚Ä¶,Since I've been a loyal customer I haven't had but one complaint and NetSpend took care of it.,5
Superior service and very knowledgeable,Reliable.....very helpful...get your direct deposit 1-2 dats early,5
I love all the features that has,Takes too long to get my money back on a dispute when the company that charged me already tried giving me the money back but company said it didn't go through because of my card holder,5
Great so far,"Quick,easy reload,it doesn't get much easier than that!üëçüëç",5
Netspend has always been a good card to‚Ä¶,Thank you  guys,5
Love it,Very good service thank you,5

Can't use Card you Keep Sending Balance of,Netspend is the most convenient of prepaid debit cards. Immediate availability to funds and two day early direct deposits are always consistent.  The overdraft feature is better than full line banking.  I love my Netspend service!,5
Now MY BALANCE SHOULD BE $2603.64 BUT I‚Ä¶,"i was having trouble using my card , and called , the employee i talked with , did not know what the problem was even though i explained what was happening when i tried to use it . so what good is a crad i cant use ?",3
Good,Well love NetSpend it is very easy to use and great customer service.thanls,1
I‚Äôve been charged $26 in fees,"Excellent, my favorite prepaid money service!",5
I has been perfect just what I needed to take care of my online bill pay,Good company,1
So far great service no problems need‚Ä¶,I love it get my paycheck 3 days early and alway get infromation on what ai spent anf my balance,5
Very nice,"I don't mind paying $2.50 for ATM fees if it is a privately owned with their own surcharge. What I don't find fair at all is using the card for purchases at POS in different establishments, and being charged $1.50 each time. Physical banks that account holders have debit cards don't get charged per transaction. This is  kind of a ridiculous feature.",4
They did not let me get all access‚Ä¶,I‚Äôve used Netspend several times. Always works great!,5
I've used NetSpend for years,Tight man real tight,1
Quad-Green,I love my using my netspend card no problems awesome customer service,4
Your rating excellent its good for me,I get paid 2days early. I can now pause my card whenever I want .. I can buy groceries using my card.,4
All around great,Great Service love it,5
Having a hard time finding how much I‚Ä¶,The settling of Dispute takes tooooo long.  I hope your System is more secured from such illegal merchants accessing our accounts.Thank you,5
The fee for this card is ridiculous,I am not very good at this stuff lol üòÇ but I am very happy to have Netspend for a debit card I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt have a while back,3
Great experience,Great service. CSR was very helpful and professional.,1
I don‚Äôt like being charged to use my‚Ä¶,It's okay.....I like tacos,5
Love,I find that the charge is to much I can see the loading charge but to pay a fee everytime I use my own money is outrageous.,4
Y'all closed my account for no reason‚Ä¶,Great. Alerts of use fast,5
This is a horrible option for prepaid‚Ä¶,Too many fees and it takes too long for money that I load onto my card to hit my account and then when I go to use my card and it hasn't loaded yet you charge me I think that's b******* I won't be using this card for very long,1
So far so good,Receiving my tax refund was quick and easy. Ty NetSpend,1
You have done a good job,"I think your fees are excessive!!! When something cost me .99, but then I see over $2 being withheld for that transaction... that's ridiculous! Then it takes too long after loading money on the card to get access to it. If I use another card that I have, the money loads immediately and I can access it immediately. Plus, their fees are not tacked on to every use. I would also like to add that your customer service is seriously lacking. One rep argued with me over what I should be able to remember! He was VERY rude! I am done using this card service!!",5
netspend rating,"Netspend account definitely is convenient but the fees that are applied using the card for certain purchases that in which are not typically applied with using my other banking services, the implemented fees using Netspend are absolutely ridiculous and senseless as well as extremely frustrating",4
Great,This is by far one of the easiest and most convenient apps to use and also very inexpensive. It helps me track my spending better than a bank.,5
I am very displeased because of the‚Ä¶,Great results and great banking experience,5
No need to unless someone contacts me‚Ä¶,Very nice and helpful,1
Very good,Netspend is a card that let's it's customer control there money. Not a card controls you and your money. Netspend has my excellent vote!,1
How can I withdraw some money without‚Ä¶,It doesn't pay check 2 days before pay schedule,4
The card is really convenient thank u,Every time I call with a problem yeah I do a good job resolving it,4
My card keeps getting locked,A half if I can,5
Awesome!!!,I loaded my card on 4/15 to pay a bill and was embarrassed  trying to use it afterwards  on 3 occasions  and was declined each time it literally  took 2hrs.for me to use my funds,4
Not the best,I love NetSpends service. I don't think I would choose another prepaid card service!,5
I was pleasantly surprised,I open a prepaid card. Then established both savings and checking. I was impressed with the representative who stuck with me through the entire process.  I felt as if I was served and my call was appreciated.,1
Since I started using netspend if you‚Ä¶,Ther service has been good,5
I don't  understand,Better than a bankI will refer anyone that I know to Netspend already have,5
It's great to me I get my paycheck‚Ä¶,My card was compromised and waiting for an update is extremely stressful. I'm dealing with disputes and the representatives have displayed nothing but rude customer service. At this point I'm just in the dark regarding my currency!,3
Everything is good,They did exactly what they said and no hassle,5
U Ben ok with me every time I use my‚Ä¶,"You let hackers in my account and steal my pay. Sure, your people put it in investigation and i ask fir provisional funds. But i still must wait 10 days for the investigation to end. Its not the the first time hackers got in my account Regretully. Gary",5
So far so good.all the service so far‚Ä¶,I am very pleased with everything butThis morning I sent a 17 dollar deposit from money network and they show it gone but you haven‚Äôt received it yet,5
I would not recommend this card to‚Ä¶,I have had NetSpend for years and I'm very impressed......,5
I have had an active account with you‚Ä¶,The only thing I don't like is all the fees you have to pay.,1
Easy and accessible,I've had Netspend for 10 years. I've not had any problems with them ever.,5
When asking for account balance it‚Ä¶,I just needed to move awney from one card to another.way to difficult problem still exists,4
Perfection,Awesome üëç. Thanks for giving me a chance to help my credit.  Every little bit helps!,4
I Love NetSpend prepaid card I Love‚Ä¶,Dependable and easy to use service! 5 stars!,5
I like when it is posted it come up on‚Ä¶,"The Representative was very thorough and quick.  She was following protocol and confirming the checks and balances,",5
I hate the fact that every time u use‚Ä¶,The whole process was fast and easy I recommend NetSpend to everyone,5
Thank you..I'm still trying to‚Ä¶,NetSpend has been great for me! Thank you üòä,2
I don't like connecting sites,They feed with this card is ridiculous. It limits how much you can withdraw at a time just to collect atm fees each transaction. I will not use this card anymore once I‚Äôve exhausted all funds on it. People take time to read everything pertaining to prepaid cards,3
Awesome app,"I like the card,compared to other card vendors, I am able to reload an amount is posted superfast, avoiding issues when making payments to meet deadlines. Also reload is available mostly anywhere some with no fee.",5
Great,NetSpend is a very dependable company to rely on and respectful people that take care of my important finincial business that I can depend on to handle my money and my assessment of my property profit value of things I can have inside of my account of my History and All of my Accounts to have banking with you all find myself undependable intelligent of knowledge to know having respect for a person knowing that my money and things or kept safe and protects me.,5
Charges a 1.50 fee for every little‚Ä¶,It's easy and it has a app why not u know everything and u can do everything off ur phone,5
Every thing is good,I was using my card and because i guess I pulled out to much they blocked my card saying I owe a fee of a$128 and I have to wait for a texted message to pay the fee. I don‚Äôt like that I would love to use my money,1
Yes I would use net spend again,Anytime I have a question about my account I always get the most helpful agent to assist me. I appreciate all of the services NetSpend provides!,4
Love Netspend,Have nothing bad to say it did a good job thank you,4
Awesome!,I think netspend is doing a awesome job. Very pleased,5
Just a few things,I haven't it before now but I have had cards.never used do I decided to get it actived and it works for me.so far I liked the use of it .it help me out more then I thought I enjoy shopping with it.,5
Thanks your service has been great keep‚Ä¶,It's good üëç I been with them for a long time,3
Five üåü,The fees are too high. Eventide you use your card it's an Extra $2 or more seem like. When other companies similar ro that doesn't charge half as that much.,5
I have had excellent experience with‚Ä¶,Unfortunately for me the transfer of funds from account is not available.,5
It's convenient to have the card,I just activated my card and added money and was charged a $5 monthly fee. I didn't even get to use the account before a fee was charged and for what? As soon as my pending transactions have posted I'm closing this account and destroying the card. Too many other banks offering accounts fee free.,5
Alerts/Notifications,First time with them n I loved them feel very confident all my questions are anserd n there service is very convenient planning on keeping business with them as long as everything remains the same,4
doing good,Like the way it loads so easily. But why,4
Boo netspend I HATE YOU‚Ä¶,Love it thank,5
Really great!!,It's the most Wonderful card I never had thank you we appreciate you,1
To many fee's,I like it because it's convenient. It lets you know what you purchased and how much you have left,5
Awesome,The cards are super easy to check balances and you get alerts every time you make a purchase I love the NetSpend cards I have 4 of them for different uses and would give 5 stars up until I needed to call customer service he was really rude and argumentative. I would definitely try and take more pride in the customer service spectrum other than that love NetSpend cards,1
Easiest way to bank online,"So far I will say I really like this card, the only thing is the $5 fee. Im on social security disability and I only get $ 189 a month so I still get charged the fee and for me that's hard because of my limited income. Thank you",5
Well I just started working about a‚Ä¶,I would like to thank you and tell you I love using your services.,5
i really enjoy my card,Two of your customers rep told me they could not transfer my money from my old card to my new card.,1
Thanks for getting back to me,"I had Netspend years ago and never had a problem.I just went back with them here recently after I moved and couldn't find a Credit Union or Bank I liked.My card was here quickly,now I'm just waiting for my Social Security to Direct Deposit.I like that they give you your Routing # and Account # right away when you sign up,even before you get your card.It makes it a lot easier to get that Info to your Employer or Government Agency quickly.",4
NetSpend sucks,I think I would recommend netspend to anyone i love it and been using for awhile great work,4
Service,"Hello Fellow Netspenders,I've been a customer since 2013. I've started with the basic card then continuously kept upgrading. The All Access is the way to go. For all those business owners like myself you must try or at least look into the Small Business NetSpend Master Card.The business perks are the best I've seen,the security features on this card are the same as all the others offering 2-3 step security measures. I've never had an issue to come up with any of the cards I was currently using. The Savings account is great. It allows you to make withdrawals up to 6 times a month. It offers unlimited deposits into the Savings account. The best part is the Paid 2 days early. So if you get paid on a Friday your direct deposit will be in your account on Wednesday, how cool is that. Let's not forget cash back rewards. The Master Card is excepted everywhere the Master Card logo is displayed. Stop wasting time with cards that promise you the world, and only offers broken promises. I would recommend that if you're looking for a new Master Card give NetSpend a try. You'll be glad you did. Stop playing with your money and put it somewhere you can trust. The 2-3 step security measures are what sold me.I've said enough now it's up to you to feel the power, confidence and security measures that NetSpend offers. Hopefully you'll have the same experience as I have. Thanks for reading my review.REMEMBER to:Keep God first. Be safe-get vaccinated,wash your hands, honor social distancing, mask on life on.",1
I love everything about my account,Glad to be a netspend card holder I have no problems using my card.I receive alerts on my phone instantly after using my card great feature,5
Was easy to sign up for and activation‚Ä¶,The fee was to much to handle but overall you guys are a good company but I don't as much for a charge fee and that and I lose money with it to,5
Charge 4 everything,This is the worst ever. A charge for everything I do. Doesn‚Äôt even accept wire transfer.,4
There are way too many fees,"Best online banking I've ever had, with many extra features...",2
I like how the card breaks down all My‚Ä¶,I really don‚Äôt like to use Netspend but unfortunately the the easiest ones when you want to dispute some thing they automatically shut your car off without telling you and then you‚Äôre screwed without your money for 45 days the representatives are very disrespectful they have no patience and they just shut your car off like they own it so I gave it a bad review and I don‚Äôt advise people to use them,1
The connection has been very bad it‚Ä¶,There is a fee per month and an ad every time I log on.,5
I'm more than please,Good card just expensive but it's a good choice,4
Dude I need yall to like get me my‚Ä¶,Since i've had this card i have had no problems what so ever. Customer service is great and get things done fast.,5
Excellent service,The people I have spoken with at Netspend have been very helpful & courteous! I have had no problems with anyone. Very professional!!!,5
You let me know when there's a‚Ä¶BEAST CUSTOMER CARE,I don‚Äôt like how I use my card to purchase gas and they put a hold on my account for $100. I don‚Äôt understand that.,4
Great,I like this service I don‚Äôt have a problem with that but the charges are absolutely crazy for sending cash to my friend in the Philippines. I have no idea why you charge more than the company that actually sends the money.,5
I do not think government should be‚Ä¶,I‚Äôm very proud with my Netspend and the people that take care of it I have had no problems whatsoever keep up the good work thank you,5
The Biggest problem I have is every‚Ä¶charging to much.,It has been a very successful journey.  Thank you üòå.      Just me.,2

Good card to have,I like it other than charging me $5.00 monthly fee AS SOON AS I opened the account. I‚Äôm not happy about that at all.,1
I was pretty skeptical at first about‚Ä¶,This card is subpar. The fees are ridiculous. The inability to attach to a debit card and only a bank account is ridiculous. The fact that it takes so long to load from a bank account is ridiculous. I really do not like this prepaid card.,5

Absolutely Absurd,I think this netspend card is what's happening and the alerts are what's helping me keep track of my money I will also recommend first time card user to try this card because it will track where and who is collecting your money,4
You guys are great I wish you would go‚Ä¶,I want to say thank you.my disability each month from ssi and ssdi will be going on this card.i will not get my first payment until may 25 2022 after that on the 4th wednesday of each month.plez let me know when its there on my card.,1

This card is very very very bad I do‚Ä¶,Great job.....no complaints. They shouldn't charge you for purchases made with the card though.,5
I have had no problems with NetSpend‚Ä¶,I do not recommend using Netspend out of country. They block your card every time you use it and charge you a lot of fees. Worst experience I‚Äôve had. I called them before going out of country so they could unblock my card and I wouldn‚Äôt have any issues and they still block my card every time. I also asked them about the fees and they said I wouldn‚Äôt get any fee charges and that was a big lie. Don‚Äôt recommend this service st all. Very disappointed,1
I've used NetSpend most of my life and‚Ä¶,None  is good  for  me and  my  family too,5
They are  good but I  have  never‚Ä¶,"Net spend has been on the up and up, period.",5

I like using the card the only thing is‚Ä¶,I love Netpend!! Also I didn't spend my last of my check it was about 4600 dollars and know Netspend will reimburse me because I know they got my back,5
Terrible I just loaded my card and you‚Ä¶,Deposit Normally Happen on Time. Or a Day Early. ATM. Using Can be Less Expensive. Because the Available ATM. In a Particular State Should Mock the BANKS.

I have had Netspend for years now,Netspend Is Everything! üòä,5
I am happy with NetSpend,Thankful that I have Netspend now. My only issue is why are we charged a monthly fee when we have direct deposit into our account?  Most other cards and/or banks waive the monthly fees when you have direct deposit.  That was my only thought/question regarding netspend.,5
I love NetSpend good job,"I love this card, I get my money a day before payday",4
The customer service was great,I needed money transfer to my Other card a new one and they were very helpful it took a long time to get it done but they finally got it done thank you Very much for handling my situation so promptly thank you Netspend I do not understand what is a trustpilot,5

Great and easy card to use and load,Helpful but language barrier  hard understand .,2
Good Service,So far so good.  My card came in time. I don't have much to say. Activating wasn't difficult. Thumbs up for me so far,5
I like having netspend.,"I am very unsatisfied with this card. I am getting charged for everything on this card. I understand ATM fees but to look at my balance or if I have insufficient funds it will charge me, an if I use at a gas station to purchase something it charges me. If I had a monthly fee say $7.00 or $5.00 I would be okay with that plus I understand to load money on the card an some ATM fees. So these are my complaints I really don't have anything good to say except I need to find a new card.",5
Works perfect for this senior!,Netspend is a safe and reliable way to deposit your money,5
Very good company,"It came in handy because I lost my wallet. So I finally activated a card I had been sent a while back because I had no access to mine, transferring money is fairly easy but the $5 fee 4 days after activating my card was ridiculous, and also put me in a bind because I was unaware.",5
I never really had issues I have had‚Ä¶,My account was hacked and the response has been slow and unacceptable,5
I like NetSpend becuz of the upgrade to‚Ä¶,"Accurate and fast service, great customer service.",5

But, otherwise I couldn‚Äôt reach anyone to activate my card the system was telling to call yet I couldn‚Äôt get anyone I got a few people whom hung up on me and stated they were would transfer the last rep transferred and the rep completed my call was very polite",5
I have not experienced any problems‚Ä¶,It's great how NetSpend is making my life easier,1
Awesome job netspend,I always loved your system and small fees but they pay it back with all the rewards etc! Thank you Netspend,5
I am very satisfied with my new all‚Ä¶,YOU RIPPED ME OFF??? GIVE ME BACK MY MONEY THIEVES. I HAD DEPOSITS THAT COVERED THE USE I USED ON THIS CARD. PAY BACK MY MONEY NOW !!! E.L.M.,5
Nice,Excellent. I love the benefit of early pay deposits.,5
I don't appreciate you taking my money ‚Ä¶,My wife recently figured out how to get online and read like the transactions and stuff she didn't know she could do it like a regular bank account after reviewing it she noticed a couple different ads and ends that she did not do transaction wise so she called in and made a dispute about it and they ended up closing her account down that's not cool that they did that to her when she's referred people she's had not spend for a minute now they just totally disrespected her,4
They charge you way too much every time‚Ä¶,Thank you for all of your help. Have a bless day,1
Netspend is a good way to bank and use‚Ä¶,I have been a netspend customer since I believe 2014. I have paid an exuberant amount of money for fees JUST to use my own money.  The last time I had to replace my card it took me literally just about 6 months.  I repeatedly updated my address verbally and online only to be charged with the 20 expedite fee and clearly not receiving any card. I had to borrow a friend's card for the last several months so I was able to access my own account and money. My last card was actually stolen from me and I lost about 250-300 dollars.  Due to the fact that I knew that I was not going to have an easy time for reporting this to Netspend and knowing that the time I was in all probability going to be unable to access my own money I never reported that issue.  Th fact that Netspend allowed someone who obviously didn't know what the pin was..allowed a few transactions get thru after numerous attempts to get gas etc etc without the pinand then they hot credit card instead and then was able to get those transactions to go through is ridiculous.  This was also at about 3 or 4 am. Considering that I have found myself unable to access the account and its mine is really not working for me.Now? I'm supposed to be this great customer and have been offered upgrades.  I am livid.  Since now that I am a valued customer I am told that I have to pay q dollar q transaction now? Plus the various fees I already pay? What sort of upgrade is this?All I know is that I am going to be closing the account and then I'll go back to the company to never have to pay these ridiculous fees again and will replace my card if need be over night free of charge.  The audacity.  Smh,1
The amounts able for bank transfers is‚Ä¶,"I could not speak to anyone on the phone. The automated thing, wouldn't take my card number or s.s. number",5
They are great I've only had q couple‚Ä¶,I tried to scan a check for $250.00 and was unsuccessful . The reason I was given is the Check was dated in December 2021 .  I could not understand the agent on the phone due to a language barrier .,1
I uploaded my check (1 minute quick and‚Ä¶,So easy to download an connect with net spend,5
Okay,I think you take too much money at time machine and stores every time I use it.,4
I love to getting the money two to‚Ä¶,"Changed the pricing of what it cost without no notice. ATM withdrawals was $2.50 each time I use the machine. Plus paying another $2.85 to the owner of the ATM. That is over $5.00 just to withdraw my own hard earned money. Then they raise it to $2.85 or $2.95. you miles well just raised it to $3.00. But it is ok. I was told twice by a rep that I could go to the bank n withdraw that way and it would be free. Of course that was a lie. However I thought ""It's only $2.50."" Not any more. Now y'all want $2.85. It's the last time I pay these ridiculous prices. After this I will join a real bank or transfer my money over to a less expensive card that don't charge for withdrawals.",3
Es de Best cards,Glad I got it and my money on my card 4 days early,5
I give netspend a one star,So far so good!! I'm still learning online banking!!,5
I'm charged every time I use my card,"So Gary, you managed to find me after all. You are relentless. Your Jedi skills are showing improvement, Obi-Wan will be pleased.",1
Excellent service and response.....Thx..,Awsome company 4 out of 5 is great in my eyes only because no one is perfect,1
Had the card for about 2 years now,"Love that I can my monthly check early, it really helps out...",5

I've always had great service and‚Ä¶,Great servce,5
The NetSpend card doesn't give free ATM,"Twice, not once but twice you deposited my payroll account to the wrong card leaving me stranded without access to my money after not once but several times after calling and talking to a representative of yours telling me not once but several times again it was going to be deposited on a replacement card but wasn't. Among other things after I called to complain I was put onhold for several minutes then when i asked to speak to a supervisor i again was put on hold that time was over 10 minutes with no reply causing me to hang up and call again with the same customer service, which this company is very lacking. Needless to say after all i've been through withyour company, I will be looking for another company for QUALITY service",5

Complete scam.,"Yall gave me a upgrade card and I just received it yesterday and couldn't activate it. I called the number on the sticker and tried online. Then called the regular 1800 number just for the gentleman to not understand what I'm talking about. He didn't listen to a word I said. IM DISAPPOINTED IN Y'ALL. & Honestly, it doesn't make me feel like this company knows what it's doing.",5

Love yall,I feel like it was convienc to use and simple,3
All good in my opinion,Didn't know that you charged $2.50 for every transaction that I do regardless of his cash are over the counter or online $2.50 that's crazy disappointed and another thing 2 days of early payment when you sign on get it straight No Such Thing exists even in New York City nobody gets paid 2 days early that's misleading,5
Netspend has homework to do before it‚Ä¶,NetSpend sucks,5
I don't like that they charge a $5‚Ä¶,"First of all I love the way I don't have to wait to cash my checks, some times my card gets locked when I need it most,and have to wit 3 to 5 days for a new card,and when I filed a dispute that tell me it all looks legit.  I never got my money or my item. 700 down the drain!!!",5

Loving my card cause I get paid 2 days‚Ä¶,"I'm disappointed ... I was looking-forward to opening savings accounts for myself and my wife, but NetSpend placed low-limits ($100/day) on the amount that could be transferred into Savings - I've decided this is not-worth the hassles and have withdrawn my deposits - cannot recommend this company for Savers.",5

Good security with warning and holds on your account if anything suspicious happens and one quick phone call fixes things.My only complaint would be the ATM charges especially since they aren't aligned with a free ATM provider.Otherwise when it comes to prepaid NetSpend is a pretty good choice.,1
No clear statement ...no easy statement‚Ä¶,"It's ok, the getting of your check 2 days early is BS though",5
NetSpend card is a excellent addition‚Ä¶,"Never ever had an issue with their services, absolutely love them. Been a customer for over a decade now.",2
Sucks,I have enjoyed all the benefits of my Netspend All access account. There offers are so beneficial for a bank account.,5
So far this NetSpend card has been very‚Ä¶,Pretty happy with card.,1
I started using net spend all access‚Ä¶,You guys are great!!! Senceyou are letting  hackers in my account and you doing anything to help!!! Why rate you.Clearly someone is using my social security number too change my account password the next morning I have no access.I like your service if you can‚Äôt get them out?? I CAN,5
I can not see my balance when I‚Ä¶,I have had a great experience using Netspend All Access. The savings feature is great and so helpful.  Sti have not been able to add my other netspend prepaid card to my active account but thats not a deal breaker in any way. üëç,5
Five star for good service never had a‚Ä¶,Just good a good card to have and it help me save my money alot. Thanks,3
I have  had a great experience with net‚Ä¶,I love this card because it pays 2 days early and doesn't charge a bunch of hidden extra fees! And there are tons of free ATMs all over the city! Thanx you guys are awesome!,5
Every time I use swipe my card there is‚Ä¶,Didnt realize that each time you use your card it charges 1.50,5
Great customer service,I am very pleased with netspend. I appreciate them letting me know when I card is being used and letting me know my balance. That makes it much easier for me rather than me trying to figure it out.,3
Keep it cival n friendly,The experience with Netspend has been very good!,5
The posting of the transactions are‚Ä¶,Can't sign in to the app for netspend. Also it feels like there is no line of communication for standard questions.,4
I like to thank you for letting me be‚Ä¶,I have received excellent customer over the years using Netspend! Keep up the Excellent Work!!! Actually I give Netspend 11 out of 10 stars!!,5
Great job and absolutely top choice I‚Ä¶,Nothing has happened everything is good,5
Do your part and Netspend will do their‚Ä¶,"Cust Serv readily avail. Accid entering 1 numb mistake of pin, wrong User I.D., or password can lock accidentally, needing assistance.",5
The only thing is I shouldn't be‚Ä¶,I use my card to do my laundry and I never get to use all the money I put on my card.  I really don't know where it goes?Kimberly,4
Excellent service,I liked how fast I got my hard card and I enjoyed the convenience of being able to add and use my money in a card.,5
Easy,Netspend does a pretty good job. The only issue I have is that they charge you to add money to your account and then they take a monthly charge from my account as well! I feel like it should be one or the other!! Thanks -,5
Charges at ATM want to change my card.,The entire process was very easy and quick. I also very much like that I can get to my money 2 days before I normally got paid. The customer service people are very nice and helpful. I love netspend.,5
Top notch üëå.,Having multiple issues with the card. Shopping online and making withdraws at the ATM have been difficult.,2
Your staff was very helpful and‚Ä¶,I was charged over twice through Netspend. I would love for someone to contact me or review my transactions and refund me.,5
Theft lies and deceit...I have explained myself over and over‚Ä¶,I like everything except having a fee everything I use it with purchases which is gonna prevent from using it that way. It takes this card a little longer to post my money. Other cards it's on there as soon as I wake up and with netspend I can't start my day for hours while waiting. Also why can we only get $325 out each atm withdraw so if I need $500 I have to pay you all and the ATM twice or more if I need more. It's a lot of little ways for them to make money,5
Everything you ask for they help you‚Ä¶,"I haven't received any problem with netspend yet and I hope that my transactions will be transparent and I don't want anything bad, using this bank in the future",1
I really appreciate this because it‚Ä¶,just started useing this card. It is good to have. I will keep useing it.,5
Excellent app,I like that it‚Äôs easy to use n doesn‚Äôt charge you a arm n a leg to use your own money,5
Too many fees,Takes long time to get refund backs that's the only down falls it has,5
Netspend refuses to reimburse my $300‚Ä¶,Ive always used netspend. and I Love it!,3
I have been with Netspend for over 5‚Ä¶,"Now this co called Netspend 1rst charges everyone a monthly fee, thats if you can catch all of thier 1.50 fees After Every Transaction and then when you change your f√® plan it ask you when do you want to start so in the beginning of feburary all I asked was them to back it up to Jan31rst, now do you think that they Honer Thier Word? Hell no the charged me the 5.00$ fee on Feb 28th  and still charged me FOURTY THREE 43 times just in the month that they weren't supposed to, and the charged my acct $95.11  and put the merchant walmart thinking I wouldn't notice, but I did, so I put a grevience one on the F√®s and one one the walmart and her it is at the end of APRIL WITH NO RETURN OF ANY OF THE MONEY THAT THEY HAVE NOW SINCE I HAVE REPORTED IT IN FEBURARY, that this financial institute has Stolen from me",1
U charge I 1.50$ every time my card is‚Ä¶,Overall I get my money a day faster. But if I'm using a dollar ATM I'm still being charged 2 taking my money off. So in actuality I'm spending $3 every withdrawal,5
It nothing special,Good useful services at your fingertips tips.,1
Helped me with complete setup of my‚Ä¶,I enjoy using NetSpend love the benefits of it and easy to understand,3
Faur,Great card use it always.cant help but feel great when I use my cardm,4
I have none,i have had no problems at all thank you for being good at your job of fulfilling costumers needs,3
Everything was great thank you very much,So far so good. No problems yet,5
I'm not sure yet I have not had the‚Ä¶,I love netspend and never had problems with being a netspend. Card holder,5
I just open my account and my first‚Ä¶,Excellent.. I got the upgrade and get my pay check direct deposited.. No problem.,4
Netspend's best feature is immediately‚Ä¶,I think it's cool just be careful what put on it or add too it,1
Very good,I love NetSpend it is so easy to use online and easy to reload and great for direct deposits. It's just simple. In a crazy world I love just simple. And I luv the text alerts so I never have to wonder about my balance.,5
I'm trying to locate my Tax refund and‚Ä¶,I need money I like NetSpend it's easy to use,2
She was very helpful and nice !!!,It‚Äôs a great card only thing is when you snap a picture of ur check to put money in ur account it cost way to much money to get the money that day with in few minutes but if u wait ten days it free it should be like ten or fifteen dollar fee to get ur money from ur check with in minutes or like free if you wait for three days to clear not ten days,1
Fees 4 dollars to add money to my own‚Ä¶,It's just the fees,5
Very Accurate,It is very convenient and don't have to take time to write a check or carry money with me.,1
I love it,"The agent was not helpful in anyway or form. He made the whole experience much more unpleasant and he did things I did not ask him to, like resetting my account password even though I didn't ask him to. That just means he doesn't listen to the customers he talks to and doesn't understand their needs or the situation and doesn't build a rapport with the customer. And almost every agent has a hard time hearing. Then to add insult to injury he hangs up on me. I think it would be fair to say that There customer service department is horrible,",5
I do not like the fact that I can  only‚Ä¶,Thanks there‚Äôs been no issues every thing is great,5
I recently loaded cash onto my netspend‚Ä¶,You guys charge me a 1.50$ for every single purchase I make,2
Love NetSpend,"I have been on the $9.95 fee for monthly transactions. For some reason my card was canceled (not by me nor was I notified)  anyway when I got the canceled card issue taken care of, had a new card, was using my card like always and went to my app to check my balance like I do everyday and I had 8 transactions I was charged $1.50 per transaction. I found that strange, I haven't been on that plan in years. As I got ready to contact Netspend, I went to open my app so I would have it in front of me when I spoke with them. To my shock the last transaction on my account was the $9.95 monthly fee on top of the fee per transaction. I was transfered several times, no one could explain why this happened, I asked on 3 different phone calls, I asked to speak to a supervisor and never got a supervisor,  they were either on the phone, out to lunch or just plain not available. As of today I still have 8 trans fees and a $9.95 monthly charge on my card. So I am looking into other pre paid cards I can use and will give me the service I used to receive from Net Spend. I might be only talking about $12.00 they owe me but it's the point not the amount and the fact they won't refund it.Your unhappy card holder,Nanci Drury713-291-6510",1
I like this card because it doesn‚Äôt‚Ä¶,I give y'all this five star because y'all doing a great job.,5
NETSPEND ACCOUNT ON THE INTERNET,My Direct Deposit issues my pay 2 days ahead of payday,2
I am enjoying using this card,Everything works fast and i get my money on time. I got it set up to where i can receive text every time i use my card. It shows you your transactions and your new balance. Its works great.,1
Why I would recommend  Netspend,I really love my netspend card. I can use it any we're that accepts Mastercard and Visa.,5
Thank you,"I am very happy with NetSpend and all the features you guys have that other banks do t have.i have been using NetSpend now for 5 years and I would choose NetSpend over PayPal,cash app etc.",5
Great,I got the upgrade card to all access but can't access it or my money it keeps saying I need a balance of at least 1cent and I added $20 and still can't access my money. My taxes have been on this card for 4 days and I'm not getting any help. I need to speak to a live person not keep getting the same email telling me to do what I have already done.,5
Very easy to use and great service,Every time I contact NetSpend to get my money it's always a problem I've been with you guys for years and it seems like it gets more and more difficult every time I call,5
I love my new account,Great card..been using for 5 years with no problems,5
They stole my money,Good job. Question answered.,5
U guys r wonderful,"I've been having too many bad experiences with issues of unauthorized transactions withdrawn from my account on several occasions. If I'm on a fixed income, apparently one should know that I'm not traveling to any other states such as Florida. California, or any other countries such as China, Hong Kong, India or Africa. I reside in the State of Texas. I'm just giving some prime examples. The bank should know to send up a red flag alert when things such as this happens. Send out alerts before allowing the funds to be withdrawn, that's all I'm saying. Other than that, I would highly recommend your bank.",1
Get people that speak good English!,I like using the Netspend card and app. It‚Äôs easy to use and load money on it and the app is easy to use and see my usage on it.,5
They help me keep track of my income‚Ä¶,I would recommend NetSpend to anyone I had a problem with a transaction and they took care of it right away very pleased Thank you,2
Love all-access upgrade!,Good way to only use what you have on the card and not spend what you do not have. Easy to move money from checking to netspend.,5
Since I have been with Netspend‚Ä¶,Excellent is what you deserve because you do and excellent job thank you,5
NetSpend üí∞üí∞üí∞üí∞üí∞,It doesn't charge you rediculous charges and customer service is always friendly and helpful. Thank you NetSpend.,5

It way gfeat,SwaGG! The best & also that you can refill? Awesome! üëçüèæ,5
My account was hacked for 905.00,pros:‚Ä¢ i DO like the simplicity of the app.  ‚Ä¢ i really like the easiness of which to reload funds. ‚Ä¢ although i don‚Äôt have have a job atm‚Ä¶i do like the ‚Äúgetting paid 2 days earlier‚Äù option that‚Äôs available to NETSPEND users as it is oh so prominently featured in TV/WEB ads! cons: ‚Ä¢ i wish the $2.95‚Äì$3.95 fees to reload @ CVS funds was cheaper but i totally understand that‚Äôs how NETSPEND makes its money! ‚Ä¢ monthly $5 maintenance fee could be a lower. 3$ would be reasonable imo.that‚Äôs my review. i hope it actually gets read by someone though! i‚Äôm definitely a satisfied customer. -Bret,5
I just didn‚Äôt realize that every time‚Ä¶,I love my NETSPEND CARD. I CAN LOAD MONEY ON IT AND USE IT ANY WHERE. SO FAR IT'S BEEN SAFE AND SECURE.,5

I don't think I need to write a review,NetSpend operators are rude thy seem like they hate there job and they have horrendous accents NetSpend need to move it's operators bck to the good old USA NOT INDIA.,5
Didn't do as promised haven't received‚Ä¶,My checking account at a well known bank was compromised and I moved everything to NetSpend. I don't have to worry where my money is because of the alerts I receive when any transactions are made. Customer service is absolutely perfect.,5
Text message alerts,Absolute garbage. Being charged 1.50 every single time I used my card?? I immediately closed my account after like 4 transactions. No thank you!,1
Will continue to use,"I find Netspend very convenient to use as a debit card. Using this card is easy, and one of the best features is being able to access my pay one day earlier via Direct Deposit. I‚Äôve been using it for years now, and I‚Äôm happy with their services.",5
I have tried others  but Net spend,excellant product,5
NetSpend does very well,Good company so far,5
Not good,"I always get prompt customer service and they are always polite, professional, and knowledgeable. I absolutely LOVE recieving my pay 2 days before pay day!!!!! I've recommended NetSpend to several coworkers, they are definitely highly recommended!!!!",5
Everything is good,I like the netspend app just dont like having to get a code every time to login,1

"Netspend""s Great !",I've used NetSpend for years now and I don't know why we'll let me tell you what I know for fact a few things about this so called NETSPEND!! Maybe because I get paid sooner! yes few days infact. No hidden fees! Correctomongus never received any hidden fees for years now still waiting.They even had the nerve to make a NetSpend phone app and free mind you that! Like wow!Crazy part is if some person gets your card and steals your money they check it out and reimburse your money like why would they even do that you know?Lastly and not mostly they let you call them for a number of reasons or problems which in fact they fixed everytime free of charge.Take that NetSpend you have been roasted!!!!!   lol,5

I've had a NetSpend card for a while,Horrible service someone hacked my card and I couldn't even speak to someone to prove that I am me.. they just kept hanging up on me.. and this is after I filled a dispute and reported fraud.. they also flagged my account for me so they were well aware and I've had my account for over 5 years just upgraded,1
So far I like Netspend handled things,It's simple and easy do I even need to mention you get your $ fast without any kind of hassle that other cards have. Setting up for direct deposit is the best of it's kind,5
So far it's been really good easy to use easy to load happy with it,I have been with Netspend for at least 7 years off and on. Off because my account is compromised without my knowledge. Then my card is blocked so l find out in line for grocery. I can't get my own money for my use. Then l pay for a new card. My new card arrive and by my first use. Repeat. I talk to netspend more often than my own family. My online account is never up to date after promising me they'll fix it.,5

Great service,Netspend has great intentions and means well to all but one thing I hate if any about netspend is over all hiden fees.. For every purchase it charges a arm and a leg... When one is barely making ends meet... Customer service can be a ride not direct at times... Never resolving the issue in the first place... Although I will say the last representative I spoke to and had to deal with my issues was perfect professional great customer service skills and payed great attention to detail... Those are the kind of people to hire for the job to be done.. Thanks alot,3
I really like how I can have access to‚Ä¶,It's good. I love the app,5
Getting my paycheck days early makes my‚Ä¶,Amazing company and always giving my pay perfectly,4
It‚Äôs wasnt ok I didn‚Äôt like tha if I have direct  possit they still stop me from using my card and keep going into overdraft it my money I pay for,"Mobile check capture with Netspend is probably the fastest I‚Äôve ever been able to get AVAILABLE funds into my account, even after business day hours,  and it‚Äôs so easy. Setting up my card was super easy and I‚Äôve gotten speedy responses to any questions I‚Äôve had. I haven‚Äôt used it enough to see what kind of rewards I can earn but I‚Äôm excited to find out.",5
Absolutely love getting my paycheck two‚Ä¶,"I don't have direct deposit applied to my card, but I still make the required monthly deposit. I don't like the fact that everytime I swipe my card for a purchase, I am charged $1.50 to spend my money.

I am well satisfied,Easy to reload and use for doing regular shopping and online business,5
Good service,"Awesome , got my direct deposit early with no problems",5
Netspend is the best,"I rather use NetSpend to pay bills or shopping,but sometimes those online shops won't expect NetSpend,I think that's wrong,that's only way some of us get paid or to pay bills..no fault of yours just wanted to voice my opinion.. I'll keep using my NetSpend,it's very convenient and no issues with anything..thank you",5
Card gets declined when I have a‚Ä¶,I like next spend on most things but my wife has a chime card and they give her a spot me and mount and she doesn't have to pay it any attention extra just pay that back I do wish NetSpend was the same way she's trying to convince me to go to the time because they offered that and sometimes we do need the extra money but I can't afford to keep paying that extra 15 32 whatever dollars,5
Great I love the fraud protection,Thank you for helping out people in need!,3
Didn't help with my problem....,I love this card fast and easy bank account,5
This was an awful mess with taxes and‚Ä¶,When I buy something on line I get a text Was it me or not... how did 109 dollars getRemoved with out my consent....,1
I love Netspend it is wonderful ‚ù§Ô∏è,Because can't use it at store to pay for anything,1
Um sum all this up IS to every one IF U‚Ä¶,Sometimes it's a little slow at getting the money onto the card but other than that I really have no complaints except for one Amazon took money off my account NetSpend and I've been 3 weeks trying to get it back and still no response but other than that I think they have a great service,5
No problem with NetSpend,I have Netspend for almost a year now. But I never had a problem. Thank you.,5
I HAD A BAD NBEXPERIENCE ON MY SECOND‚Ä¶,Thank you for your email. I haven't had much trouble. I only needed you to put any money  l had on card ending in 2524to the  new card ‚Å∞ 7232,4
Excellent,Every thing is fine except the fact you take most of my money. And for what? It was supposed to be an upgrade if I knew that you‚Äôd take my money for a ‚Äúmonthly fee‚Äù I wouldn‚Äôt have upgraded my card. A few for what exactly? I don‚Äôt use the over draft.,1
Great app with easy accessibility ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ,I have gotten good results with NetSpend it is easy for me to track my money and I'm able to save money thru their services with a savings account easy to transfer money also thank you NetSpend for making it easy and helpful.,5
I love it,I have been a NetSpend member for nearly 10 years. I couldn't be happier with the service I receive. Never any problems.I recommend NetSpend to friends and co-workers.I will remain a loyal NetSpend member.,5
I‚Äôm still not getting ‚Äúany the alerts ‚Äú‚Ä¶,The young lady that assisted me named Bob b o b was wonderful she took care of all of my issues and problems with no hesitation and she was extremely polite.,5
The services are very great quality and‚Ä¶,Easy to use the Netspend card is so easy and helpful to use.,2
The service seems fine,It's to many fee to access my money.Don't like it an will not be using or referring anyone.,5
YOU SUCK,Certain sites and apps it will not allow me to use the card.need to have a chip on card.,3
Got the card for my grandson to use,Love the benefits of NetSpend. You never have to worry about overdraft and you get a balance after every purchase.,1
Awesome,I must say that I am very Happy with the quality of Service and timely service üòÄ üòÑ üòÅ üëå God Bless and Thanks!,4
I don't like it at all,"The NetSpend card is a great option to a bank account. The only thing I don‚Äôt like and was surprised when it happened was that online it gave me a list of no fee atms in my area. But the atm charged me $3 plus NetSpend charged me $2.95. For a total of $5.95 to use a ‚Äúno fee‚Äù atm. I expected the $2.95, but the extra $3 I was not. I do have the monthly plan on my card. Would love someone to explain this ‚Äúno fee‚Äù to me.",5
I didn't know that there would be so‚Ä¶,I received the card in the mail from netspend.   It took me a couple of weeks before I activated it and put money on it.   So far it has been extremely   helpful.,1
It costs too much to spend your own‚Ä¶,Very professional and polite any time I talk with them.,1
Awesome,The reason for my star rating is because I got charged to use my card extra at McDonald's at Scooter's Coffee shop at Walmart I shouldn't be getting charged anywhere from a dollar fifty to 350 every transaction that I use my card for that don't make any sense that's never happened to me before and now it's happening I don't understand,1
I had to call twice,Pleased with how easy the app is to navigate.,5
I don't think that I should be charged‚Ä¶,I like getting my paycheck early. Loading locations are inaccurate on the website and fees on basic ATM & loading cash are high.,3
I like the text for account balance on‚Ä¶,It's great get paid early every month,2
We shouldn't have to pay you $5 a month‚Ä¶,It was never stated that a $1.50 charge on each transaction of using card,5
my expectations met and business professional???,I don't get my check 2 days early and I got a card then had to resend off a week later and get another card other than that it's been pleasant,1
Used Net Spend for years For your Money best thing going used to get pay check on card and add money on card at loco store,You can't use this cards bank information to pay some bills like it says,5
everything went perfect had no issues,It was a pain in the ass to setup. Wouldn't take my direct deposit for some reason. I missed a whole months worth of paychecks. Called for help and got none. ATM fees are crazy. As well as the 1.50 charge everytime I use my card. Wack.Edit: re: no thanks. Why would I actually pay you guys to screw me around? Free is good for now,5
I love üíó that I get my paycheck 2days‚Ä¶,I love NetSpend . It's the only card that actually works when I need it to. With the app and all,5
The fee is extremely high,"I'm very pleased with the alerts , notifications,  very prompt. It's a secure feeling knowing that it's being watched and alerted when I don't have the time.that has saved me a couple times already. Thank you for the great service",5
The fees are outrageous!,Netspend is amazing they make it so easy for me to manage my money.,1
The only thing I don‚Äôt like is it cost‚Ä¶,I love using my card I'm glad that I chose to be with yall,1
Don't get this card you will lose money‚Ä¶,"My name is spelled wrong, oth rwise could lower the reload fee",4
Your  VISA  and  Mastercards  issued ‚Ä¶,Netspend is honestly good I recommend it to anyone who‚Äôs looking for their first prepaid card,1
I absolutely love netspend all-acess‚Ä¶,Great service good job,1
Super,Can't ever access app.   Have to keep changing the password.,5
I am disappointed in the direct deposit‚Ä¶,The operator I spoke to was professional & courteous. She helped me with 4 or 5 issues! She was amazing!!,5
I don't like the fact that I get‚Ä¶,This a nice company for business,1
The Lord is my salvation,"This is just what I wanted, thank you!",4
Customer service is good,"You charge me fee‚Äôs,for getting my own money!!......never again!",5
SO far no complaints except I wasn't‚Ä¶,Needs better integration options for sending and receiving funds from external accounts. Current options are unnecessarily complex.,5
The service is excellent,I use my card all the time and it‚Äôs a really good card,5
The limit is only $500 i wish it could‚Ä¶,Haven‚Äôt received my card in the mail yet,5
Do Not have any problems.,So far great would suggest to friends,4
You charge for everything,Never had any problems satisfied completely,5
So Far So Good...,"The fees for depositing a check by phone are totally random and insane. My biweekly paycheck, which the amount doesn‚Äôt vary much, can cost anywhere from $30-$90 to deposit. $90 to deposit a check is unbelievable. I‚Äôm already paying a monthly fee to use the card. The company I work for doesn‚Äôt offer direct deposit, so I‚Äôm constantly paying the ridiculous fees to deposit by phone. It‚Äôs just a huge waste of money and there seems to be no rhyme or reason or set percentage that it costs to deposit a check.",3
I am still waiting on my $240.00 that I‚Ä¶,"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!! Two weeks to activate a card given to my 16 year old son for his birthday! We were treated like criminals because we didn't know who (from our family) gave it to him (because he's 16 and threw it in a pile like all teenagers do!!!)! Tried and tried and tried relentlessly to get it to go through! I had to escalate the call to four different supervisors, on the last call, before finally getting it activated, but ONLY on a ""limited""use because I refused to send a copy of my SSCard in!!! WHAT THE ACTUAL HECK?!?! Nope!!!! Worst ever!!! I will NEVER recommend this company to anyone!!!! Totally horrible! Poor people who have to work there too! Ugh! Very frustrated parent here, forgive my rant!",5
I‚Äôm unable to send more then $100.00‚Ä¶,I love it... My money is on time or early and I dont have to worry about anything because of the direct texts.... Best one yet....,3
Quick and easy.,Quick and easy to use. Thank you,2
Very good card company,The only problem I have is paying a fee to load money (in addition to direct deposit) onto the card.,5
I love my net spend card,Customer service needs to do a better job at explaning the way this particular card works.  I received more information about the card by listening to the automated service.,5
Try it,I just got my card and so far I'm very pleased with how it can be used.  I like the mobile app. Thank you,5
Great experience thank you but not a‚Ä¶,let's see I can't talk to a live person y'all keep on telling me to go to the website to log in it won't do that y'all won't send me my damn f****** password I got another card it does not work but it has my money on it activated another card it does not work freaking embarrassing I put my number so y'all can call me too nothing from y'all you are nothing but slackers 361-541-3699,5
To tell the truth a overall job they‚Ä¶,I love the fact i get alerts on whatever money i spend,5
NetSpend is Handy when u need it,"Greetings, I've had NetSpend since 2004. With my time with this company currently I've seen lack of humility and consideration towards my needs. Yes staff seem passive but aggressive but notin my favor for their personal attributes. With my Husband passing away the bank gave me no prior information letting me know my cards alterations, but I'm hopping it's outcome is soon and satisfactory to me because I've only received 1 direct deposit from USA Treasurer's officeThank you MrsGarrisHoward",5
EXCEPTIONAL,The only problem was the extra on with draw,5
You guys charge for everything you‚Ä¶,I'm being charged $1.50 for every single thing when I make a purchase. Not cool.,5
Great card great app great service,I think netspend is the best online banking that is out there from  my experiences,1
Your card charges too much to use it,NetSpend is a good and reliable card I like the service and all the alerts that they have on their card,5
Rewards,"I have been with NetSpend for quite a few years, and I'm very satisfied with NetSpend. I appreciate the text alerts and keeping me informed when a transaction has been made.

Best card ever!!!!!,I good ‚ù§Ô∏è job 8,2
No good service,"Still no early deposit,My financial institution is netspend,The bank/payroll depositing the money has given me a notice stating amounts deposited and I still have yet to get early access to my money. I'm taking my banking needs to a real bank that can give me early access to my money. I also can't stand auto responses with Grammar errors.",5
Great service,I haven't need,2
Really like NetSpend,Don't know what to say. Other than went to a 711 gave cashier 200 bucks and my card he said 5 dollar charge. Walked out the store and the funds were available just like that.,5
I can count on NETSPEND to get my money‚Ä¶,Someone is breaking into my account all the time.,5

It's just Great that's all,Never got the money two days early ATM fees a little more,1
Because two purchases were approved‚Ä¶,Because I hate how you guys say you can spot money then can‚Äôt do it it‚Äôs annoying and you should reword your stuff better instead of fake advertising,5
Just as expected,Great it's all good it works great thanks appreciate it just wondering how do I get the extra ten bucks when I do run low but you learn that it's running great thanks appreciate it,1
Great online service,"I was double charged , overdrafted, then had to get another card cause they marked it as stolen even though I said it wasn't now this card every transaction is charging me 1.50 I'm about done.",5
Netspend is great,Awesome  app ! Secured,5
Barely got my card,Very user friendly and client centered!,5

Great card great service,This card saved me when I didn't have enough money for my groceries it let me overdraft my account and didn't charge me if I put it back within 24 hours. I love getting paid sooner also,5
Love my Netspend,I love that I get paid before everyone else in my group.  I love the fruad protection and I  love the overdrive service. I hate the ATM fees and the 20 free I have to pay when I do overdraft. I wish Netspend would wave that fee seeing I have direct deposit.,5
Came in handy when I lost my Debit‚Ä¶,Did not help never received my email lost a $200 deal because this company would not send me a email,5

How ever I still haven't received the‚Ä¶,I like NetSpend but you guys limit my withdrawal to only $300 @a time plus $3 fee. So to take out $1000 is like sending my self western union,5
The $1.50 every transaction kills‚Ä¶,The over draft feature is horrible and too expensive why would I be charged a 20 over draft fee for a 1.00 charge which was charged incorrectly there should be a limit on the overdraft option but idk I‚Äôll be removing the options immediately,5
I'm very happy with it,"Good card for my direct deposit,Thank you!",2

Great,"The customer service that you provide lacks quality. It took 2 weeks to complete the transfer of funds from my savings account. Then, you shut down my card and I had no access to my account or funds.I had to buy another card in order to access my funds. This caused me money that I should not have had to pay.",5
I don't like that there are a few apps‚Ä¶,I am not spending my money üí∞ like I used,5

I'm having a great experience,"It's a great card but, if I have direct deposits. Why do I have to pay monthly fees?",5
Fees on top of fees and long waits when‚Ä¶,"I just started with Netspend. I put money on it, and the transaction and people doing the transaction were pleasant. Better than a credit card where it takes a whole page for a business math student to figure out exactly what they are doing with your money.",5
Excellent service,UPS continues to leave my page at the front door allowing them to be stolen.,1
I love it they only take 5 dollars out‚Ä¶,I was hung up on at least 4 times and transfered another 4 times and no one could find out why my money was transfered to an old account that was in the negative instead of transferring it to the account that I had the flash ID for. I have never been treated so badly by any customer service ever and after 6 hrs on the phone accomplished nothing. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was placed in hold for 45 mins and never spoke with a supervisor the line was conveniently disconnected again. Yes someone contacted me to say there's nothing they can do. Now if this was not done purposely to collect an old debt then why would you then refuse to reverse the transaction? Either way netspend is wrong.,5
Netspend is an excellent banking‚Ä¶,It's beneficial to have netspend and very helpful if I need help thank you,5
Mmmhhhh okay good,Very good com,5
Fast easy and convenient,I'm very satisfied with my NetSpend card I find it to be economical and also convenient. You stood for the first time for my state refund I will use it again,5

Will haven't got to use it yet,It was a great experience with handling my new debit card so I rate u guys a 5,4
Its a sad and dangerous world we living in now.,"Had a issue with a merchant Planet 7 casino to be exact. It  started out at 9 am today I purchased a entertainment package that was to have certain bonus‚Äôs and specials, You could pick from $50 up to 1000 I agreed to 100$ Package. But when I got alerted from Netspend thst a transaction was posting they had charged me 109.92?? So I immediately attempted to reach Plant at seven and ask them how come they overcharged me what was the reason enduring that request not only did I find out I was overcharged! I also received a lesser package by far the bonuses were nowhere near what was promised and there‚Äôs no rules no Playthru and no cash out limit we‚Äôre not in the package that I received and one of my main reasons for buying a package to start with was for those reasons alone!!!  So after three hours of trying to contact Plant seven to no avail we‚Äôre supposed to have this great 24 seven customer service which I was finding very hard to believe at this point and second-guessing my decision to purchase a package. So at this point I was frustrated and I decided to call my card holder and let them be aware that I was having some issues with my last transaction and what steps that I need to take. Netspend‚Äòs customer service was five star she answered all my questions and relieved me of and my worry is that if they didn‚Äôt get my purchase and my pricing straightened out they would step in and help if needed but I was advised to continue my efforts to reach out to the merchant and give them an opportunity to take care of it in a reasonable time. So at the end of the day it‚Äôs seven hours later now and still no response so I made one more attempt with yet another email but this one stating that if I didn‚Äôt get a response back within the next 15 minutes that they were leaving me no choice but to contact my card holder for a second time and give them permission to stepping on my behalf and escalate the unauthorized overcharging of my account as well not providingMeet with the service that I had purchased. And with that said believe it or not GuessWhat and less than five minutes I got a response from planet seven via live  chat.  The customer service rep apologized and asked if fire didn‚Äôt mind waiting a few minutes and if I could give him my information so that he could look into it so I gave him my information he comes back and says OK I can see that you‚Äôve been overcharged and you‚Äôre also stating that you didn‚Äôt get a package that you would purchased I‚Äôm going to get you in touch with our customer care team that‚Äôs in charge of accounts and they get this taken care of for you will that satisfy you will that work for you? I responded yes that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve been trying to get done for the last seven hours I didn‚Äôt want anything more or anything less I just wanted what I purchased to start with and then secondly I just wanted to pay what I agreed to pay nothing more nothing less his response was not a problem,, then I asked how do I get transferred and I hope this isn‚Äôt going to be complicated he reassured me that they would take care of the situation and then immediately here popped up in the chat with the customer service representative from accounts. Now mind you this entire time I‚Äôm screen shooting all these chats and what added insult to injury was about 1030 why it‚Äôs been a couple hours trying to reach them and sent some complaints they had sent another email with a package identical to what I was supposed to receive to my email inviting me purchase it ! That was a poke in the eye So she apologizes that they‚Äôve been very overwhelmed with people she says give her a few minutes she comes back she says I apologize but at this time the casino is chosen to close your account for safetyAnd the well-being of the casino and that was at the chat ended nothing about giving me a refund. Netspend assured me I‚Äôd have my money back in three days! Now that‚Äôs customer service when A person needed it most!!  Thank you NETSPEND!!",5

NetSpend is great been using it for‚Ä¶,Netspend has excellent services... it helped me throughout all my transactions no problems... if problem does accure they send me a text n a call to let me know that a transaction is happening.,5
This account works good for me,I've been with NetSpend for six and a half years almost 7 absolutely love them I just hate that when you want a loan most companies don't deal with them because you don't have a bank to walk into a physical and I will actually like if we are able to transfer more money in a day on a card,5
I had to pay a bill asap,Just crappy everything about you it. Can't login plus keeps denying me. So I gave up,5

I have never received my all-access‚Ä¶,Everything is great. Thank you,5
Ok good job very good,I wasn‚Äôt able to withdraw more than 350 dollars it was super frustrating I had to pay rent and I was 2 days late and had to pay extra because of late fee which costed me an extra 50 dollars because it took me two days to get 750 dollars I had the money in my account there should have been no reason for this huge fiasco I will not be using this card ever again once the money I have on it is spent,1
I haven't been able to get into my‚Ä¶,I'm just learning bout NetSpend n so far in all good with them. Everyone that I had talked to was there to help me out with questions I asked bout.,4
Been ok for most part,"Called in one day on a fraudulent charge that just occurred on my account.  I asked to put a stop payment on transaction and I was advised that couldn't happen.  I feel you should have the same process as banks do.  Banks have the ability to stop payment before the merchant is paid or person is paid . I have to wait for the transaction to be approved by the scam person or merchant? My money, should be my choice especially if it fraud!",1
No issues at all using the card,Have always been very satisfied with all service.,4
Good app,Your card services are very useful and very dam costly.,5
There for me when no one else was.,"I have NetSpend card for few years and have a visa and a Mastercard I'm very happy with the service, customer service etc. I recommend NetSpend to everybody.",5

I didn't know u had to pay everytime I‚Ä¶,I actually haven't had a problem with Netspend. Except they charge $9.95 to get my money off my card with a bank teller. If it was reduced to maybe $3 I would be much happier.,5
Great,Customer service is awesome.  I can get all my questions answered. Everything I need to know is right up front,1
Great,I extensively researched and called customer service for information on where I could use an ATM for no fee. All of the listed options and what they tell you through CS are wrong. The listed ATM'S charged me a $3.50 fee. That is no good!! It should be changed and updated immediately!!!!,5
Okay I am satisfied with the usages as‚Ä¶,There is a lot of bank necessities that NetSpend does not offer. I would like to see in the future where you're able to do wire transfers for buying a home.,5

Great service,"Getting paid 2 days early is cool, but my cash app card does the same with no $1.50 charge everytime I swipe it, plus the hefty ATM fees, and (unsure yet if they do this) ""monthly fees"". But overall no problems so far.",5
My experience has been disappointing‚Ä¶,Been a value customer for years to come,5
Quick deposit and refund,you can doo anything a credit card can do with out worry of late charges or interest charges,2

Review,NetSpend makes day to day life allot easier with great customer service and programs that meet everyone's needs.,5
Using Netspend has helped me alot in‚Ä¶,"So far everything is great. My phone got hacked a couple of weeks ago, and I had to cancel all of my online banking. Didn't know what I was going to do.

It's great just don't work to buy‚Ä¶,I love Netspend free loads convienent locations,5
Great Service,NetSpend is the best card in my wallet. Thank you.,5
Your app is really slow to review it‚Ä¶,"I had just loaded my Netspend card at a local Walmart with $500. It had been a week and I hadn‚Äôt used the account so I was confused when I attempted to make a purchase and my card was denied. Later that day when I attempted to log into my account on line, to my surprise the account had been locked. It seems that an unauthorized attempt to charge my account had been made and the Netspend company caught the suspicious activity, denied access and lock my account for my security. Customer service was very helpful, explained their procedures and promptly issued me a new card which arrived at my door by FedEx the next day !!! Great job Netspend!!!!",5
I did not contact net spend,I like the fact that I get paid 2 days earlier but the fees to withdraw money are way too much.,3
I'M  GLAD THAT I GOT THIS NETSPEND CARD‚Ä¶,To be honest I've been with NetSpend for years. I've had problems with my lots of money that I couldn't get past why it was so hard to be able to use my cards for which I am Ferdemingo Alveraz Pace and Ferdemingo Alvarez Pace to. Just thought NetSpend should know that. Besides the wack online site that needs to be upgraded ur customer service representatives these days are excellent and thank U.,1
Got my income tax refund on a net spend‚Ä¶,Good service but need a feature like line of credit for people who have payroll direct deposit on their account,5
East to use and very helpful,"Great card, and easy to set up for dirext deposits,  bill pays, and ev6in between.",5
It was amazing ü§© and not hard at all‚Ä¶,To much fees not worth it,5
Excellent,They do very good for me I don't have no problem with Netspend,5
Ok to use,I've been helped and it's working just fine,5
I haven't had a card in some years but‚Ä¶,I got my card and it was very easy to activate and to take cash off.. Thank you..,5
I called customer service to install‚Ä¶,Service is excellence always get my alerts when my card is used. Only thing my check was late one time and after all the years I been with you guys they took my overdraft. Which I couldn't believe after I been a faithful customer  all these years really upset me.,5
Netspend is a good financial system to‚Ä¶,"NetSpend is there when I need it, my regular checking and charge account has been hacked too often but NetSpend seems to have protections the others don‚Äôt. Thank you Net Spend.",1
Thank you good service,Great Service Would recommend NetSpend to family and friends,5
It really useful card it can save and load funds,I like your customer service and I also like that we get paid two days early,5
Your company is great I have never had‚Ä¶,Very nice and glade I chose this company and for on the spot calling and their personal staff to talk if need a question ask at any time,4
There shouldn't be a fee on top of the‚Ä¶,I like Netspend bit they need to not rop off their own customers when we are trying to deposit a check by using the app and requesting funds asap. They wanted to charge me $37 to use my own payroll check within 24 hrs!!!!!!! Unheard of. Also there needs to be more places to cash a check that they offer right now. This was a serious disappointment to me as a loyal customer.  Outside of that issue I am pleased with MetaBank.,5
Too many fees,I love netspend they take awesome care of my money and customer service is the best they always help me when I have a issues,3
Everything is fine,"NetSpend is convenient and easy to use, only complaint is the kinda high monthly cost of having the card.  I only use the card for child support payments and they take roughly 8.00 a month just to collect about 15.95.   but other than that it's a good card.",1
Good,Netspend has been great for me to confidently shop online . They have defended me many times against fraudsters and kept my money safe .I highly recommend Netspend services for stress free spending,5
Great service,Just got a letter in the mail saying you are raising your current fees not good for me and why,4
Great service,NetSpend is always on the spot when it comes to my money. Thank You .,5
Customer,Netspen has been a great and positive experience. Not secret fees just good only banking. Thank you NetSpend,5
Good and accurate!,Every time you make a purchase you should have pay a dollar every time and netspend should charge you $5dollars months fee...,5
The overdraft is a true life saver,"I can't login, I tried reset password. I never got a temporary password.",4
I have to reinstall my Netspend app,"I really like the all access card,because now I can pay all bills on line,without the company saying I can't pay with the other type of cards,plus the app that you can download really makes things even easier.",5
Thanks,Love it So much it's great and very fast and no reason to not love it,5
Love the freedom of debt card,I gave 2 because I never get notifications when I get deposit or when I use my card I have to keep calling my to see my balance,5

Your policy about going forward with‚Ä¶,Netspend is tha sh,5
To many fees,NetSpend has always solved issues I need resolved thank you I will recommend the service to my friends and family,1
It sucks that you charge $1.50‚Ä¶,You have great customer service but sometimes the wait to talk to someone can be long and alot. Of the time Im unable to wait to talk to a customer service representative.,1
I've been using Netspend for almost a‚Ä¶,"So far I have been very please with the ease and convenience this card has provided. From activation, loading cash & paying bills on line. I am Still relatively a new customer but I am very happy with the experience so  far",1
Great,I love using NetSpend... Always get my money when I need it,5
Yall need to tighten up forreal,I been with Netspend 12 years since they started and never have had a problem. If I did they responded and fixed the problem the same Day. I'll always be a Loyal customer,4
You helped me get my money back from‚Ä¶,I would give a 5 star review but u have to leave room for error,1
Fees,"The greatest pleasant simple reliable spectacularPriceless amazing card affordable rates that is my comment,",5
I have never used NetSpend,I don't plan on using my debit card againI'm okay,3
Good services,Thank You for having the best pre- paid cards to allow direct deposit or placing money onto the account.,1
Too many charges ND extra fees,Your whole check download was hard to use and instructions were vague and difficult to find information,5
NetSpend is very useful and is easy for‚Ä¶,Had some trouble getting my new card going called them up and within minutes my customer service agent had the ball rolling never have I had service as professional as I did today,1
Great customer service!!,Agent was very helpful figuring out what the answer to the problem I was having in just a few minutes talking to her.  I had called once before to figure out the same thing and the info I got from her was incorrect and I left the conversation more confused than I was going into that call.  This one made up for it.  Keep keeping agents like this one and u guys will do even better with ur company as a whole.,5
Great card,Its good but I don't like how y'all deactivated overdraft I have money in there few days later not 30 days bc I get paid direct deposit but its very useful,5
Love it,So far my experience has been very good... would recommend to family and friends,5
When I received my netspend all access‚Ä¶,This is my first time using my Netspend card in a good while. It is convenient to have and use I just think charging $3.95 to load money everytime is way to high.,5
Overall,Every time I have any kind of problem NetSpend is there to help. I have yet to have anything that hasn't been handled efficient and professional.,5
I used the NetSpend card for my tax‚Ä¶,I'm not able to get the card accepted for paying bills on line,4
Thanks,No complaints so far ev√©rything is ok. The only things is you guys close the weekends and had to wait until Monday to post my funds to another account.       Thanks Darryl,4
well in the beginning i was a Netspend‚Ä¶,Nothing special. Just another bank card.  If you have $$$ they want it if you don‚Äôt. Forget about it. I‚Äôm waiting for a bank to offer $70 dollars for a day or two when my balance is $3.15 for a week. No matter what the perks are they are all out there to Fu@k you & take take take as much as they‚Äôre legally allowed to.,5
Just take any NORMAL regular bank and‚Ä¶,I think when I spoke with customer service they were very friendly and helpful,5
Didn't know about the transaction on‚Ä¶,"Hello,Great stater up card for anyone you get a lifeline card if you need one.The fact of the matter is this card is a must have it' the best kept secret.Best Regards,",1
I never got a complaint resolved,It is ok but you can only withdraw 300 dollars daily. I think it should be at least 4 or 5 hundred,5
I like net spend because it really‚Ä¶,Was great getting a update on balance of funds,1
Been very easy n helpful to put money‚Ä¶,I had reported my card lost/stolen...still waiting for new card and information to dispute charges unapproved.,5
I don't understand how you could let‚Ä¶,For me netspend. Is great. I give 5 starts.,5
I appreciate that Netspend mailed my‚Ä¶,Thank you. I'm not the best position to do this...hope it helps.,1
Very helpful answered all my questions‚Ä¶,When I first use my card it was very easy and great using it I just love it. It was not hard to add money to my card. I am really glad I chose Netspend.,5
Terrible problem solving skills,"Kim a customer service representative at NetSpend went above and beyond ,she spoke to a supervisor on my behalf and clarified and answered all my questions and solved my issue in a timely manner .

My experience  was horrible.they‚Ä¶,Very good and fair banking and most likely trustful,5
Never receive my money and the employee‚Ä¶,Way toooooo many fees. Everytime I turn around there's another fee. Fee for this fee for that... It gets old when you deposit 100 in the account and you know 15 bucks of it will go in fees. I can't even call and check my balance without a fee. Rediculous,1
I appreciate your services,Love them!!!!!!!!!!!! Great service,2
Five star review,Haven't had a problem so far been using it for years,5
Cool,Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to use the features and the reloading cash fees are ample to say the least in addition to not being able to activate cards online and having to call a number is a hazard . But for a debt card to use for your direct deposit or if you can‚Äôt sign up at a normal bank it comes in handy .,5
NetSpend has been a decent company.,I have a friend that told me a long time ago to use Netspend. He was right. Awesome experience,4
You are efficient computing you with‚Ä¶,My account was hacked so I call NetSpend and had them stop payment on the purchases that I did not make they went ahead and stopped my card froze my card I had to go and buy a another card from the store to transfer my money in because three days later I would be getting a direct deposit from my job and I was worried that if I didn't pick up another card that my direct deposit would not go through I went and got the card and called customer service they were really cool they told me that everything was transferred and that I was going to be okay for my direct deposit 3 days go by my new card came in which was awesome I didn't think that would happen but it did and my direct deposit went through so I went to Walmart to get things that I needed from the store and for some reason my pin would not work I had a line of people behind me who are getting very irate and I called NetSpend to see if they could do something really quickly tell the cashier I had the money I don't I didn't know what but the customer service rep told me that it could take up to 30 minutes for her to email me a new PIN so I could use it with the car to get out of the line well I had to cancel my order that was over $200 worth of food frozen food things to that nature and I had to sit and wait for NetSpend to get me the new PIN number okay well finally I got it and it worked yay I'm so glad for that got my stuff home and now I have a different pin apparently they sent me another pin and I don't understand I hate being caught at the cash register trying to check out and all of a sudden it makes you feel like you don't have the money in the bank so I love NetSpend but I'm not real happy right now I'll get it all taken care of his time goes on and I still would never go to any other bank at all right I'll always be a NetSpend customer,4
THE APP DOESN'T WORK,NetSpend was by the worst experience I've ever had I would not recommend them to anyone . I still can't get access to my very own money.,5
i just love netspend,It sucks. You shouldn't take money from the owner of the card,3
ATM fees cost too much & u only can‚Ä¶,I love NetSpend I get my money two days early thank you NetSpend,5
I have used netspend for a long time‚Ä¶,Over the traditional banks which hold your money when it's released from the federal reserve bank they make money off our money .WELLS FARGO IN.MY. Opinion ARE CROOKS AS BANK OF AMERICAN,1
I love NetSpend,"Netspend is a cool, safe,and convenient way to keep track of your money,sends text and email every use! Convenient reload locations and has direct deposit. Yeah...a four star ratingüëç",5

Great way to keep track with your‚Ä¶,Goodjob always,4
NetSpend was great,I like it quick and easy to use fees are not bad could be worst but over all use of it i would recommend it,5
I signed up for overdraft but it didn't‚Ä¶,Great I can‚Äôt complain,5
Very convenient,So far so good so my experience with NetSpend has been good I give it a 5 star,5
Your company charges money to add money‚Ä¶,You guys take money every time I purchase something,5
Buggy app,I would of given 5 but you don't have my bank or cash app so I can transfer money,1
Wouldn't even give it one star but‚Ä¶,Love the convenience and simplicity of the account!,3
Great job,How does a charge I did Not approve happen while I'm asleep (at 12:32 in the morning)?Also the ATM fees Netspends charges EVEN at a Fee Free ATM are redicklus.,1
Good,Keep getting scammers and your company is working hard to retrieve my money thank you,5
I love t he easy way to do direct‚Ä¶,The only thing bad besides the many prompts when you call in are the fees to use the card from your end as well as the establishment,5
Thank u for the help,I am not very happy. I was charged a$1.50 fee on top of each pin purchase in 1 day. That's way to much money to lose. I had $8 on my card but couldn't purchase$8 in fuel.Thank you NetSpend for the fast response. I really appreciate that. I am expecting large deposit and I chose your card for convenience and all the great features I read.,4
you have really helped me out with‚Ä¶,I canceled because everytime I used my card I was charged and I felt it was a load of crap!,4
Love this card.,Yall have lied and stold from me i got 20 dollars in gas yall took out hundred  and charged  me overdraft  i have never  experienced  such scam.,4
Very helpful,"I have had netapend for almost 16 years, I have not never ever had a problem using the card. I would highly recommend N if they don't this there loss",5
I use to really like netspend,Everything worked the way it was supposed to and timely as well thank u,5
Very Awesome Customer Service...,Net spend is super helpful to me each week to make my deposit of my Lil weekly check.,2
Money is not returned in reasonable‚Ä¶,"The automated system doesn't always comprehend as needed, and there seem to be holds or blocks on when and what you can buy with your cards",5
i just dont like you have a limit on‚Ä¶,Good card. Easy and fast.,3
It's ok nothing special,"I would like that when they promise some services they are real. For example, if I want to deposit a personal check, they tell me that I do not have enough credit and that I have to wait more than two years where you promise",3
Straight up,"I've been a customer for four years, and I spoke to multiple Netspend representatives on the phone for four years. They also verified who I was with my card information and social security number. Not one time did a Netspend representative say they noticed that I had other Netspend accounts under my name and social security number, not even an email. I login into my Netspend account, and I noticed an unauthorized transaction. I clicked on the transaction, but I could not see it, so I called Netspend. I asked about the unauthorized transaction. I was told it was because I had four to five accounts with Netspend under my name and social security number that they had a negative balance. After explaining to the representative multiple times that I only have one account with Netspend, they tried to say that they were my account by repeatedly asking me the same question and saying your accounts were negative. I ask to speak to a manager about the issue. The manager was not helpful at all. Very rude, I tried to explain the problem with zero assistance. They took my funds out of my account without even notifying me about the fraudulent accounts. The worst part is that they ask me to submit a claim on their own mistake. Once I submitted the claim, they closed my account. I had zero access to the account. I did not ask Netspend to close the account. They did that themself. I had funds in my saving, and I don't even know what they did with the funds. My paycheck goes directly to the Netspend account, and they did not even want to explain the service is the worst. There was zero notification from Netspend about the fraud account under my name for four years. The customer service is terrible. The company only cares about the money they make from people, not helping people. I will never do business with Netspend or recommend Netspend to anyone.",3
Great,Great! Awesome!,4
Great,Easy to use and manipulate money between prepaid and savings. Only negative is depositing cash. ATM's listed do not accept deposits.,5
Very pleased,Love this application. I have no issues with anything,5
Great card helpful customer service,"my card was hacked, netspend helped by issuing a replacement card with transferred funds so i could continue my business",5
Great,"Efficient, well mannered and very helpful when I presented them with the issue with that was hampering me concerning my card.",5
I love you card,Works for me all the time so far I'll give you a hundred percent quality,5
It‚Äôs a excellent card,First of all I never lost my card I call customer service number and was told my card was stolen It was in my hand trying to use a A T M well then I am told it's cancelled so I have to wait for another card. So I use another card and it does add my money on it.My account is frozen for some reason.And nobody has contacted me.I can't get anyone to answer the customer service phone number This company deserves less than a star,5
I still am getting run runaround,It has been a pretty good service so far i haven't had it but a couple of month the over draft feature is great when you get in a tight spot it can help get you thru. So far so good don't know how well they work with hacking problems or how good customers service is but ok so far,4
Love it get paid 2 days before pay day,Hey I‚Äôm enjoying the card haven‚Äôt had any problems with it yet thanks,5
I have trouble understanding customer‚Ä¶,"I wish NetSpend had a zero star I would definitely take that one or even a negative one they steal money and ruin people's life's stole over $3,000 from my fiance it's ridiculous how much this company gets away with",5
Love it,I have been with NetSpend for years an everytime I've had an issue they have been very prompt on getting to the issue I'm very happy with NetSpend I give them an excellent rating,5
I have problems getting into my APP and‚Ä¶,Excellent Customer Service and Rapid courteous solutions.,5
It's great I love it,The customer service is great when you can get a hold of an actual person.  Too many promts to go through. Otherwise I love my cards.,4
NetSpend accounts are very useful for‚Ä¶,IM HONORED TO BE A MEMBER OF NETSPEND FOR SO MANY YEARS AS I CONTINUE TO STRIVE TO BE THE LOYAL CUSTOMER OF NETSPEND‚Ä¶. Thank You,5
Good company!!!,Getting in touch with NetSpend is a kind of hassle. Every time in go online it tells me what to do then it doesn't work. When I have to start over they send me another card. I now have 4 cards.,5
My reasons for this review and 2star‚Ä¶,GreaT service reccomened to anyone so come join our team,4
I love netspend its easy to use and‚Ä¶,"This card has given me nothing but, problems since day one of using it",2
I do like using my NetSpend card,All is good except for the fees.   $3.95 to load. $2 for each pin purchase. Way too high.  Going back to my Walmart Card. No fees ever.,5
You made it easy to get my tax refund‚Ä¶,I can't transfer my money to any other accounts I have. Netspend is a complete failure!!,3
I Have Been With Net Spend  About 7‚Ä¶,I've had a good experience with netspend I receive my paycheck 2 days sooner with direct deposit I love that about this card!!,5
Netspend review,I still can not on in to my netspe d acount,5
Great service,"Everytime I use my NetSpend card to purchase anything, I am charged 1.50 per transaction. Makes no sense",5
I feel I have made the right choice,"I like having confidence with NetSpend. It allows me to function as if I had a secured bank account in any other facility. I get updates, can transfer funds, direct deposit, etc.What I am not too happy with is that for every outdated, lost or finances have been frozen card (which has been rendered useless and has to be discarded), it is awkward having to call in a money transfer to yourself or to another card you may have on file. Lets say you had 3 cards, but only 2 are active, the third card will be on file so if you want to transfer money from one card to the second active card, the money winds up going to the inactive card causing you to wonder how it got there if it is inactive.Therefore, calling NetSpend support for help wastes time to correct the issue.",5
Not much to complain about.,Steven Moore March the 17th2022 $500 was drawn out my account be transfer was fraud 14147281,5
It is a good card I like were I get my‚Ä¶,Easily got my Irs refund check direct deposited.Fast notification alerts.,4
Waiting for my refund taking too long,"It's good, but payments should be cleared a lot faster",4
I don't like the card I shouldn't have‚Ä¶,This card is everything they said it would be,1
So far good transactions,My new card came fast enough but there has been no word on these disputed charges?,2
I love Netspend and would recommend it‚Ä¶,"I don't usually give the highest rating to anything. Netspend has me on alert with all transactions. Somehow they even manage to recognize when seemingly odd transaction is made and I've been alerted. I'm always made aware of when my funds are available for my use. I can also pay bills and make purchases from the comfort of my home. Customer service support is kind and informative. Yep, choosing Netspend was on of my better decisions.",4
"As a customer of Netspend,I enjoy the‚Ä¶",I really like using the netspend card. Its very helpful.,5
I've been a customer for a while.....I ‚Ä¶,Netspend has been amazing and will to fix any issue quickly,5
Easy to use,"I like the card, but I don't like that every swipe of the card there is a $1.50 fee attached to it, I mean what about every 3 swipes? Or every or swipe.",1
Excellent,I think it's an excellent card to have. The fees are reasonable. The $5 protection plan is reasonable and they don't over do it with monitoring my account putting unnecessary holds on my account for purchases I make every month like my old bank did. The only drawback about this account is that you can only withdraw $300 a day and that's ok with me until I make more income. For now I am pleased pleasantly. Acceptable terms. Thank you Netspend!,5
No problems with the company at all‚Ä¶,Impossible to get ahold of a human at customer service number lately online service has been down more often than not,5
Whenever I call to get information‚Ä¶,I enjoyed getting my direct deposit 2 days ahead of time.I think I would like I can make a deposit within  three miles within a location,5
Customer service could be better‚Ä¶,Since I've joined their banking system is convenient on all my financial Levels and has been a great experience. The Customer service representative I've dealt with is extraordinarily gifted and empathetic in handling accountability the way I would if I was supporting a Company or Brand so that the whole team can be successful.,5
Monthly Fee,Well I am going to say I used to think NetSpend was really great until one day I called and asked a question about stopping payment to a online place and the next thing I knew the guy on the phone cancelled my card and now I am not able to cash My check with NetSpend anymore and I had to pay 20 dollars to have a new card 2day air cause all the money I had was on my card so it screwed me financially alot and now I rarely use it now and it is all because of one employee screwed up everything.,5
Quick and efficient service and getting‚Ä¶,"Just figured I'd give NetSpend a try and I absolutely love it, I don't regret a thing about choosing NetSpend.",3
I had my identity stolen and I sent you‚Ä¶,Need to try with clerk. More effective.,5
I ordered another card but couldn't use‚Ä¶,F****** suck you guys been over f****** charging me and everything I go to buy everything it's b*******,1
Great Service,"The loading fee is lower than my other cash card. Good. I love the feature of texting me immediately after a transaction and in the morning. Answers my questions before I ask them.  A few years ago, someone stole my wallet out of my car and tried to use it unsuccessfully.  I was texted right away which alerted before I knew my wallet was gone. I was able to call the police and they apprehended the person.The only negative is that it I have to travel 20 minutes from my house to load the card.  Yes, I live in a rural location. There are businesses nearby, just none of them have Netspend loading.",4
Called with an attitude,Good quality of service and a easy to use app. With no hassle fees. Happy qualified customer,5
To confusing to get direct deposit‚Ä¶,"I have enjoyed the easy access and availability to updates. I'm really comfortable with my direct deposit and that my funds arrive early, great bonus. I also like that I was offered another type of account benefits which will make me feel like a real guest of the services offered.",5
I appreciate the service I receive from‚Ä¶,"Whenever I needed a quick money solution, Netspend has worked out for me.",1
It‚Äôs the best card iv has,Im very pleased with NetSpend services. I have enlisted at least 12-15 of my friends to join and everyone is very pleased. Thank you,4
I just don't like the extra money that‚Ä¶,The availability to load money on the go is great as a handyman I don't have time to go to bank with people using PayPal an cash app now days I no longer have to drive to clients to pick up money for their materials I can be on another job an receive their money an order their materials without leaving job netspend has made my life a lot simpler.,5
Netspend is great,If possible I would like if Noone can take anything out unless I know first please this,4
Best card Ever,Good app and service,5

I would give 5 stars however I can't‚Ä¶,"I've always had great customer service experience when I've needed to contact them they have all be polite, courteous, and professional. They've solved every issue I've had. Their security measures are great to. Someone to try log into my account and it was recognized as a different device so my account was immediately locked and I got a notification to contact NetSpend So did and they immediately had me to change my login info. I've also gotten emails asking if I was aware of a charge going through because it wasn't a familiar transaction on my account. So yes they stay in top of keeping your account safe from everything. I've been a NetSpend customer for about 3 years now and I have no plans of changing that anytime soon.",5

Got over charged,I live the covienence of this card! Never had an issue.,5
My review,"I've found the card easy to use.  There are two areas I find problematic.  One, when someone fraudulently uses my card, it why I cannot get to the money. It put me in a bind recently. Second, the fees on getting a card sooner is way out of seniors, such as myself, to pay. Please accept this as my thoughts.  Thank You",1
Were rude and did not resolve my issue,I enjoy this prepaid card and works and easy to load and fast,5
NetSpend>Chase,Been with you guys for a long time so I have no problems with your service been good too me so stay like you are,1
It üëç,Easy to use and get direct deposit with as well. Glad I chose you. Thank you,5
To many fees,Why you charge me 25.00 to get my money off the card. BS,5

Thank You                        Sylvia Kennedy,5
Netspend Review,I've had several negative issues since I opened my first account about 5 years ago. I've had to file disputes to attempt to have my money returned several times. I've had overdraft protection on my accounts and attempted to use it and not been successful therefore adding more service charges. Overall I would give them 2-3 stars,5
Satisfaction,The service is terrible I'm only able to use my card every other day the app is useless it doesn't work I've been issued for cards now and each one is just garbage honestly I should get my deposit refunded and able to use a different service I am severely not satisfied,4
Every problem I have with my banking‚Ä¶,I Love Netspend And I Get Paid Two Days Early,5
Best card around,They are amazing,4
Good üòä,"It's a good card to have, you receive money on it faster and can cash checks right through the app but it's just the fees are way to much, even after I paid the 5$ a month plan so I'm not charged EVERY SINGLE SWIPE I still i get charged for all the other fees they have. So the card has pros and cons ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",5
There are always helpful when I call‚Ä¶,I appreciate all there quality customer service. I appreciate there helpful staff online and over the phone. Big thumbs up,4
No complaints just leaving room for‚Ä¶,Keep up the good work love the experience with this online thing learn from this but most of all customers service great.,5

The operator that was on the phone with‚Ä¶,"I have no problem using my Netspend card to assist me while paying my bills. The only complaint l have is getting one sent to my home when l don't request it. Sincerely, C. Hicks",5
Awesome,It can not be used with most autopay services and it does not work for age verification,5
I am pleased with the services I get‚Ä¶,Fast easy service. Also dependable. I know my money is safe,5
I love Net Spend better than my bank,I PayPal'd onto this card and if I try to use it in a store it's declined. If I try to use it to buy something online it comes back saying that it's fraudulent. It's not fraudulent! They charged me $5 to have this card that I cannot use at all.,5
Specific little or banks for savings or expense,Netspend Cares About It's Customers!I recently switched to an all-access Mastercard and the card I was using expired. I mistakenly had my tax refund deposited to the expired card. I called Netspend and the problem was expedited quickly and satisfactorily.,5
Their fees are crazy!,"NetSpend has too many fees,  not enough FREE ATMs.  Otherwise, NetSpend is great!!!",4
Hit The wrong StarlI love Net Spend l‚Ä¶,Everyone that I've ever spoken with did a outstanding jobs. Thanks üòä,1
You are a very good company you all‚Ä¶,"Transferred money from one of my accounts without my consent supposedly for cards that are expired, cards I have NOT used in years!!!!, cards so old the notifications didn't even have the last 4 of the card's account that the funds were to be transferred to. Been with them eight years and for my account be invaded this way without my approval is unprofessional and to add insult to injury, the first associate to answer my call, hung up on me. Never the less to say I was furious,so furious the surge of dorphomines made me ill.  They left me 19 dollars and some change out of a couple 9f hundreds. Sad but true!!!",5
I feel like as much money as I put on‚Ä¶,"i went to seven eleven, put two hundred dollars on my card, it did not show up,went back to seven eleven was told to bad so sad in fact they said i was trying to scam them even tho i had a receipt that i had paid and i went back less than an hour after it was paid.  called netspend and was told there was nothing they could do, to bad so sad.  what if it was more money that i was having a problem with. what if i had direct deposit with this company.  my faith was totally shaken and i will forever not trust netspend to have my back when i need them to.  would not recommend them to anyone and when i see commercial on tv it makes me sick to my stomach.  i am on a fixed income and could not afford to just throw two hundred dollars away.  this happened at the seven eleven on 13th and stewart in las vegas nevada",5
I think that NetSpend is the Greatest‚Ä¶,"Very accessible, life is easier",4
Always great service,I lost my card that ended up stolen from a fraudulent spender on my account. I immediately turned the card off and netspend returned my funds quickly.,5
Excelent !!,"The deposit amount of $100.00 is too small.  Need about $300 per transfer amount.  There is too much time lapse between transfers.  Once a deposit has been completed, another transfer should be available.  Checking the account every day to see if I can transfer is a big pain.  Maybe this isn't the best plan for my needs.",5
The app stucks,I don't have a checking account and its the best card for my needs...,5
The Best Prepaid Card Ever,I think it is one of the best i ever have used it's been convenient in transactions without carrying cash  and very helpful day to day,3
I have been a NetSpend customer for‚Ä¶,Being charged to use my own money is crazy,5
Excellent,I feel comfortable with this prepaid card .loading it is a pleasure.,5
I sometimes have to wait for a long‚Ä¶,"Horrible experience. I always had to re order a new card because hackers somehow kept getting my card info and spending at least 50 dollars unauthorized! This would have never happened with a real bank account. Also, netspend customer service is very hard of understanding. Their language is not primarily  English, which makes the whole experience that much worse.",5
Fee s are a little crazy but ok,"I have had a great experience with NetSpend. I get paid early, I have never had any issues with my card or account, it's super easy and quick to load my card, and customer service is friendly and helpful.",5
netspend is always good to me get‚Ä¶,Love it. Super easy. But my only issue is the amount taken for instant cash a check.,4
Love this card and work great win‚Ä¶,Don't care to explain service sucks n that all I'm saying,5
Would be a 5 star but I don't like the‚Ä¶,You've already tapped overdraft fees. Hasn't been 24 hours yet. You really should hire English speaking customer service agents,5
I love use my NetSpend card I have been‚Ä¶,"Thanks for 5he understanding, I loves net spend",4

Amazing terrific always work.,Very convenient card to carry easy to reload with minimal fees,5
Great prepaid card,Great service,5
Thus us a great way to get started‚Ä¶,Excellent job,5
Get rid of all fees,Very reliable. Thank you.,5
I like the service.,I‚Äôve been with Netspend for some time now and I love how fast my deposits get my my card? Seamless website and many locations accept this card on top of the rewards you get,1
it is good,"It's my go to,the only thing is customer service or I would give 5 üåü stars",5
The NetSpend card is an ok card to have‚Ä¶,"Easy enough to use, except I can't pay metro PC's phone bill with my all access NetSpend Mastercard because they won't accept card payment without a card that has a chip in it. Or other companies like Direct TV stream won't accept payments from my NetSpend all access Mastercard either......just the two companies won't accept payment so far, but that's two companies out of the eight online bills that I use this card for so I have to withdraw cash at an ATM to pay metro PC's and I had to ditch direct TV stream because of this.Also, ATM charges seem steep when the ATM charges $2 just to have NetSpend charge $2 for transaction. I could be wrong but I remember seeing free ATM cash withdrawals (limits on how many cash withdrawals can be made each month) even with the upgrade to an all access NetSpend mastercard with qualifying direct deposits (min. 500/month direct deposit) Got the new all access debit card, $5 monthly maintenance fee was waived as advertised with direct deposits setup but I can't withdraw cash from an atm without a penalty, and I can't use upgraded account on my phone bill or TV bill, they won't accept type of card payment because it's labeled as a gift card in their system. The original NetSpend reloadable card I had couldn't overdraft account. it would ask do you want to use remaining balance of $6.74 towards the $8.00 purchase, Or cancel purchase. The new all access NetSpend Mastercard card issued when I setup direct deposit seems rigged to drain funds, it allows overdrafting. Also it's banking at ATM's is not as free as advertised in terms of service. None of these added features seem beneficial and the original NetSpend debit card/gift card's $5 per month is way cheaper then one single overdraft at $20 each. ...............it's a debit card, not credit card...........",5
It's so convenient to put money on my‚Ä¶,You guys are amazing keep up the great workYou guys rock! Thanks again,3
I enjoy the Metabank bankin,I love NetSpend and I will always be with them very trusted and on time every time,5
Netspend is a great service to use and‚Ä¶,"I recommend NetSpend, they are very helpful and have no gimmicks.It's easy and self-explanatoryI don't regret opening up an account with them.",5
GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE,Awesome excellent easy to use the only thing I cannot figure out how to do if it is possible is had my other two NetSpend cards with the first one I have a regular card and all access card and a western union one and I would like to have all 3 on my app,5
Not happy the way it works or does,"everything was great last year, but now everything cost an extra dollar fifty but other than that it's good.",5
It costs $1.50 for every transaction,It‚Äôs pretty good it just took forever to transfer money from My bank it should give me the option to do a quick on the spot transfer and pay a few cents to couple dollars in fees then to be forced to wait cash app and PayPal have these options,2
Love the card and company,I love it it's easy and your able to build your credit as well,1
Great,The cards ok to use,5
My money loaded quickly and correctly,I haven't had my card very long and in the past two days my card is getting declined and may have interupted two expensive online purchases for my business.,5
Excellent üëå,I like my card just wish I can deposit checks,5
Great,Alot of places don't know how to reload the cards,5
Haven't had an issues ever,They could improve on having more then one account. Putting restrictions on my account.,5
I just love Netspend very very happy‚Ä¶,I just started out with NetSpend I do hope to go a long ways while am with them. Time will tell if I made the right choice,5
It was good .,Netspend has made it pissible to save money and not overspend. Will  refer it to anyone.,5

Always satisfied with Netspend,"I love Netspend . I was having so many issues with my last bank card but with Netspend , I get paid a day earlier than my normal direct deposit time and this card does not and hasn‚Äôt given me any issues YET! I swear this is a real review . This card is good to hold extra funds on when you don‚Äôt want them to touched . Love it!",5
Love them fees could be better but‚Ä¶,"I like the ease of the website.  It's easy to navigate and all the questions I have are there for me to lookup. I love the card, as long as there's funds, it never gets rejected and every time I swipe I get a text message alerting me to my recent balance.",5
NETSPEND does a great job,Love it been with y‚Äôall for a while now,5
Can‚Äôt use netspend for certain apps and‚Ä¶,"Netspend keeps sending me messages saying that the transfer has been completed, but that is not correct because Netspend cannot transfer from Wells Fargo to Netspend. Take me off your email and messaging lists. Thx",5
Simply EXCELLENT!,Well so far I like it need to know how to set up a on line banking,4
Thank you,I had my identity stolen  and they are working with me to get it taken care of and they are keeping a close eye on my account  for any movement on my ssn so helpful  helps me to not stress so badly  thanks netspend,5

Bank Transfer denied.,"So far, so good",5
Love the ease of using these cards!,"I kept having to pay $5.00 every two weeks to transfer money to the right account. I changed my card to another card. But it never caught up. I did this for three months, calling customer service but it never changed.",5
I‚Äôve never used netspend but have been‚Ä¶,For the most part always ready to use customer service always pleasant and do their best to fix any problems.Would be nice if they sent notice 24 hrs to warn on automatic at least the first payment they pull to assure and remind us to cancel any free trials we me want to remove . That would give us time to cancel it But overall they provide what they claim to and no big problems,5
Reliable and convenient.,I‚Äôm enjoying using the Netspend card. The app is also a great way to keep track of funds.,5
I don't know what happened but I can't‚Ä¶,"Netspend keeps me on track with no overspending, no surprise fees and balance. Will never use a regular bank again!",5
High Interest Savings Account at the Price of your Sanity,The netspend service was great and easy to use thank for great service.,4
Great customer service had a problem‚Ä¶,NetSpend is the best card ever ii tell everyone about NetSpend,2
Never have any problems customer‚Ä¶,"I haven't had any issues with accessing my money, or any issues that required me to come running to customer service",5
Some sites won't let me use my card,I called customer service one day just to ask them how do I transfer money from my NetSpend card to another debit card and the lady ended up canceling my NetSpend card and I had no access to my money and I didn't ask her to do that and she still did and then I was f***** screwed because I had no access to my money and then they had to send me one in the mail well they didn't even send me one in the mail they just ignored what I was talking about and took it upon themselves to cancel my card and then not even send me a new one until I called thim like 2 weeks later. NetSpend is janky I don't think they're good for anybody,4
The fees are the downside,I like the service and it keep track of my money,5
Very easy to use,Was not really helpful.. did not answer my question and rushed me off the phone.. kind of rude,3
Well my experience with NetSpend has‚Ä¶,"It's still early, only had this account for less than 2 months, but so far I am very happy with it",5
They do a good job,Great & a very great,5
I don't like that even though I pay‚Ä¶,I lost my card.  You guys stopped payments soon as you seen weird activity.  I love your business,5
Vary good for me,"I Been using this Credit card for a month now, very satidfied with NetSpend! You can choose your own plain to pay fees, I Highly suggust getting one it's better than other credit cards!",4
I love NetSpend and if you love me you‚Ä¶,My social security deposit is not in my account and I have not received it yet!!!!!I have nothing are serious!And I was told from a supervisor that I would receive it today on April 1st. I have nothing,5
It is worth getting a net spend card,Need to charge less when using card. Have more time to pay the overdraft and bigger amount to get to use.,5
The best,"NetSpend is great. Always get access to my money early and I am always notified of a deposit immediately. The only problem I have is the amount of cash I can get from an ATM. It claims to be able to do 3 separate transactions in a 24 hour period of $325 ea. But upon using the ATM, it would only allow me to get $320 the 1st transmission out when trying the 2nd time to withdraw cash it only allow me to get $100 then the 3rd time it only allow me to take $78. Adding up to$500 but in small transactions which costed me a fees along with fees charged by NetSpend and after that I was not able to get anymore cash from ATM that day. So this is a downfall of NetSpend. Other than that I'm happy with them.",5
To many fees,"Your assistance regarding my issue was helpful,but not resolved,as I am still having issues in logging into my account.  When I needed to be given my password I was asked to enter my card number, security number,and my SS# not knowing how secure your page is. I didn't do and will not provide my SS#,to expose my personally SS# to have my password resent. It is not happening.",5

Not like it used to be,Worst company ever. I DO NOT RECOMMEND GETTING A CARD WITH THEM. Literally the worst decision I‚Äôve ever made.,5
By far the best prepaid card I've had‚Ä¶,"I have been. Customer with NetSpend all access for 4 years. My wallet got stolen and money taken from my account. So what does NetSpend do? They cancel my account saying I'm high risk and now I'm fd out that money. Some protection they got and especially after being a customer for 4 years. I'm so disappointed in them. Reply to netspend reply:Funny, i never got a phone call, text message or email after you guys closed my account. April 10th is the day i get the decision on my claim or i get provisional credit. Ill update after i hear from them. Sure it wont be good",1
View helpful quick answers,I recommend for people to used a card like netspend.,5
It took a whole month to get a‚Ä¶,Netspend is great easy too use and you can open multi - accounts which is very useful to me to use on the internet there are fees of course but considering the benigits it‚Äôs good for me,5

Bad attitude,I gave it a good review because they definitely deserve it.,4
Love it !,"I have always got great customer service. I don't think NetSpend has the word no in it's mission statement , they let me turn on or off overdrafts . They encourage you to be more productive by way of rewards system and I'm never broke . NetSpend is agood company",1
Highly recommend netspend,Good so far thanks,5
Fast and efficient,Love netspend I've never had a problem with them five stars from me!!,5
.netspend helps,It is what it is. It works but they didn't do anything spectacular. It was their own mistake they were correcting to reopen my acct.,5
Made managing my funds easy with‚Ä¶,"So far net spend seems ok. I gave 4 stars and not 5 because of the monthly fee they charge. I have other similar account services with Wisely and Chime and neither of those charge a monthly fee. I set up my finances (this may sound confusing, but it works for me) so that my pay check is split between accounts through direct deposit. So.... wisely gets what I need monthly to cover rent, net spend is solely the money for car payment and insurance, chime is my day to day expenses and my traditional bank gets what's left for my ""savings"". it's just my way To manage my income. For this purpose I like net spend, I know that the deposite is always an exact amount. I pay my car payment, then save anything left for when ins is due. I pay insurance 6 months at a time, not monthly. So the net spend savings feature is good for me to store my ins money until it's time to renew my policy.",5

Awesome,"So far so good, this week i make my first deposit",1
Awesome services God Bless,"I have had the worst experience possible with NETSPEND from the day it was initially loaded. There should be a Zero star rating.  I chose this card for vacation being that Netspend was a top prepaid card.  BOY WAS I WRONG!!! THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIBLE.  I preloaded the card with $550 for a 3 day hotel stay for my family (mind you all the funds for our trip were all budgeted out before hand) The hotel charged my card a few dollars extra, my card naturally declined this transaction because the amount loaded was less than the total amount charged.  Declined, Declined, Declined.  It obviously does not take rocket science to understand the card would be declined due to insufficient funds.  This was on March 19th.  NETSPEND HAS REFUSED TO RETURN MY $550, MY CHILDREN AND I HAD TO STAY ON THE BEACH IN OUR CAR BECAUSE THERE WAS NO CUSTOMER SERVICE SUPPORT AVAILABLE.  NEEDLESS TO SAY IT STORMED THAT NIGHT.  OUR VACATION WAS RUINED AND NOW IS THE 28TH OF MARCH.  AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO REACH ANYONETHAT WOULD LISTEN FROM NETSPEND, AND WHEN I WAS ABLE TO REACH AN ACTUAL LIVE PERSON I WAS CONSTANTLY BEING SPOKEN OVER, AND MOCKED. I COULD NEVER GET A WORD IN EDGE WISE.  I WAS TOLD TO SEND A LETTER FROM THE MERCHANT STATING THAT THE TRANSACTION WAS DECLIND SO THAT MY FUNDS WOULD BE RELEASED.  AGAIN, NOBODY WOULD HELP.  THE MERCHANT SENT 3 LETTERS EXPLAINING THAT MY CARD WAS DECLINED DUE TO INSUFFICIENT FUNDS, NETSPEND WILL NOT RELASE MY $550 TILL THIS DAY BECAUSE THE MERCHANT PUT THE CHARGE WAS OVER $550.  AGAIN, MY CARD WAS DECLINED DUE TO INSUFFICIENT FUNDS, NATURALLY IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE FULL AMOUNT NETSPEND IS NOT GOING TO SPOT YOU THE EXTRA FUNDS (AGAIN THIS IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE!!)  BECAUSE THE TOTAL AMOUNT CHARGED WAS OVER $550 ($550 WAS WHAT WAS LOADED) THEY CONTINUE TO HOLD THIS CHARGE, WHERE? I HAVE NO IDEA?  THE MERCHANT, AS WELL AS MYSELF HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL AT REACHING ANYONE FROM NETSPEND WHETHER IT BE BY TELEPHONE OR EMAIL.  THERE IS NEVER ANYONE WITH ANY KIND OF SUPERVISORY SKILL TO ANSWER OR HELP WITH THESE KIND OF MATTERS .  AGAIN, IM CONSTANTLY BEING SPOKEN OVER TO THE POINT WHERE I WOULD HAVE TO YELL OR JUST HANG UP NUMEROUS TIMES DUE TO FRUSTRATION, IMAGINE MY FRUSTRATION HAVING TO CANCEL OUR WHOLE FAMILY VACATION.  SO BASICALLY, IN A NUTSHELL,  NETSPEND STOLE MY $550 RUINED MY FAMILY GET AWAY, WE HAD NO OPTION BUT TO COME BACK HOME.  YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW MY CHILDRED WERE FEELING, ALL FOR NETSPEND TO KEEP THE $550 AFTER WE TOOK ALL THE PROPER STEPS TO HAVE THE MONEY RELEASED.  AGAIN, I CANNOT STRESS DO NOT GET THIS CARD.  YOU WILL NEVER REACH ANY KIND OF ASSISTANCE.  NEVER. SHOULD YOU BE LUCKY ENOUGH TO REACH SOMEONE, GOOD LUCK HAVING ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED, OR SPEAKING ON YOUR OWN BEHALF.  YOU CAN TRY TO CONTACT HEADQUARTERS AND AGAIN YOU WILL BE UNSUCCESSFUL.  PLEASE DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE UTILIZING NETSPEND.  THIS IS MONEY THAT WAS CAREFULLY PLANNED OUT AND BUDGETED FOR OUR GETAWAY.  THATS JUST HOW LIFE IS FOR US.  SO $550 IS A PRETTY PENNY TO BE STOLEN AND NEVER RETURNED WHEN THE CARD WAS DECLINED, THIS IS MONEY BEING TAKEN AWAY THAT I WORKED FOR SO THAT WE COULD ENJOY A SMALL GET AWAY.  RUINED COMPLETLY BY NETSPEND.  I WILL BE REACHING OUT TO ALL SOCIAL MEDIA OUTLETS POSSIBLE  ABOUT THIS HORRIBLE CARD SO THAT OTHER INDUVIDUALS WHO ARE IN THE SAME SITUATION AS MY FAMILY AND I DO NOT HAVE TO HAVE THE HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE THAT WE ENDURED DUE TO NETSPENDS HORRIBLE SERVICE.  DO NOT UTILIZE NETSPEND UNLESS YOU ARE OKAY WITH BEING ROBBED I WILL NEVER EVER USE THIS CARD AGAIN.  THANKS FOR RUINING OUR VACATION NETSPEND!!!",5

Great customer service,Limited in transactions in or out. Transferring funds. I found the Western Union NetSpend card to be everything I needed.,5
Easy Banking,I don‚Äôt like that they turned off my overdraft when it gets paid back every week,5
Excellent service,You charge to many fees my tax check is going to be deposited and I don't want to pay 1.50 per transaction that's a rip off so it's going to cost me close to 6 or 7 dollars every time I pull money off your card sucks ones ally money is off your card can suck it that's the last deposit it will get good way to screw your customers,5
It‚Äôs was very useful.,I am great for the card and service of this card ... Thanks,5

Great,"This card is worth having. I have had a NetSpend card for 10 years and the service is so good I got one for my son when he went on a trip and was able to send him extra money when needed and it only took a few minutes for it to be on his card after sending it. I mostly use it for bills that have auto draft setup. Which is why I have more than one. I have a main card for my paycheck and tax refund, the others are setup for bill's, which allows me to keep what I need when I need and not have the auto draft from the bill collectors take it out from under me. I get text alerts for when money goes out and in with my current balance and that helps me to manage my money better. You have to set it up how you want your features but if you don't like that and want everything done for you and complain when you don't get what you want then this card is not for you.",5
The settling of Dispute takes tooooo‚Ä¶,I enjoy using it I like it is very helpful being paid a day earlier than my pay day   so far so good no complaints,5

I feel good God is,Locked out of my account for unauthorized charges I called to cancel and order new card. They required me to prove my identity so I sent proper documentation to verify my identity and because I recently moved my address is not the same as when I created my account so they will not lift my lock on account. Suspended all access to my account. service is horrible and can‚Äôt understand them,5

They are great,I totally love Netspend! I have my paycheck deposited to my card. I love the feature of the text balance after each transaction.,2
Because Netspend is a rip off!,I think you need better easier ways to deposit and transfer funds into or out of ones account. retail deposits are very limitingThats why i gave you (3) Also i tried may times buy online ecards and yet none but one was approved and that took almost 6 hours. Also i tried numerous bitcoin buys thru 6 different buying apps yet Netspend would not approve yet last month you approved on my first try. Why was that?I like your reps in customer service thoughGary,5
A great alternative banking option.,"Netspend has been convient, useful, user-friendly, and hassle-free from the very beginning. i received my debit card in the mail promptly and also found the virtual card feature to be very easy to use and convient as well.

I talked to a customer service Lady by The name of Love. She told me to be 90 days before I got my money refunded. I then asked to speak to a supervisor, which took 22 minutes on hold. My time is more valuable than that. He told me that it shouldn't take 90 days but I don't believe it. Most banks would refund immediately. Not very happy with your bank",5

I was using my card and because i guess‚Ä¶,"I was very happy with the last help from one of your assistants, thankyou!",5

I have pulled my $ off card and will be cutting it up as that is not convenient for anyone. I might have been able to overlook this but then when I went to pay bills my card which had more than double to cover bill got the ach declined with no explanation.

Great way for direct deposit and‚Ä¶,I appreciated the quick response and understanding that I received,5
Being accountable for your spending,"My last experience on 12/31/2021, with your customer service reps wasn't really bad, yet wasn't too good either. The first rep, while entering my information, acted as if he didn't understand how to properly fill in the customer's name on the profile creation. He seemed to not understand what to enter in the middle initial line, when a customer has to middle names that start with the same letter. He literally tried to argue with me for 5 - 7 minutes about it and ultimately didn't even save the profile and sent me back to the beginning of the automated system. Then the second rep, did a much better job with his customer service skill, even though we literally went through the same process over gain. Yet this time, this rep didn't have access to transfer my funds from my main account to the temporary one that was supposed to have registered by the first rep. So, the second rep made sure the temporary card and account was registered & set up, then connected me with a third rep who seemed to have complete access over both accounts and was very polite and helpful with transferring my funds between accounts and even noticed neither rep let me setup my PIN for my temporary card. She also went over both mailing information and double check each account before we ended the call. Luckily we were able to complete everything with 30 minutes to spare before the New Year! I understand it was a very hectic day from anyone working customer service on New Year's Eve, it was definitely crazy for me since it literally took 6 hours of automated sending you in circles or just hanging up and 3 customer service rep to get the job. I've been a long time customer pretty much since the beginning or first year and your I trust your product or service still to this present day. I'm thankful for the fraud prevention rep and the last 2 customer service reps for helping me get everything done and maintain access to my funds. I would have gave a 5üåü rating if the automated system had a select digit to press to go to at least a customer service rep with general knowledge to help you when a customer has limited information like the situation that unexpectedly happened to me. Also the first customer service rep definitely needs a refresher course in professional expression and just listening to the customer, basic customer service. Thanks for your time, keep up the good work!Hilbert Anthony Allen Baker",5
I want to say thank you.my disability‚Ä¶,"You used to allow over draws of $10, but I guess you don't do that anymore so that's why I gave only a 3 Star rating",5

Very satisfied with the card no‚Ä¶,This is truly the best bank ever. I recommend it to my family and friends. Excellent customer service and support,5
It's been good so far,"-no chat feature-no way to waive 5$ monthly service fee- mobile check deposit feature (available in-app only) is an EXTREMELY convoluted,  fee-based process, involving a 3rd party vendor- calling to get through to a live  customer service agent is impossible... you just get put on hold by the automated answering system and no live agent ever picks up - no FREE way to pay bills (ACH payments) directly ... only   a  high  fee   bill payment service through MoneyGram - loading money onto card is also a fee based service, costing  (a minimum) of $ 3.95  per load.Would not recommend.",5
Excellent services,"I found NetSpend to be very easy to maintain, to transfer money to and from and was easy to set up and did not have to deal with a lot of the other stuff and unnecessary things that other apps or prepaid cards have.",4

Netspend Review,"Need to have more banks through the US , getting charged to deposit cash and a check is inexcusable, especially when the bank charges 5.00 a month to use them",5
I agree with everything it was nice,The first time I used the card was at an ATM in speedway I tried to withdraw money and the transaction was declined.  I called to check my balance after the transaction was declined and it said that I made a withdrawal and I did not!!  Now I have to dispute the transaction the first transaction I ever tried to do.  That sucks,5
The best service,"So far I got the opportunity to get this system to do away with older version, I like the organization of it.  The layout in the software is user friendly.  I have only used it for a momth or two but I am very confident and even upgraded.",5
I've had netspend for over 10 years and‚Ä¶,I'm very upset with this card and I did direct deposit I should of never did that they charge me 1.50$ every single time I use the card so if I buy a dollar water I pay 2.50 it sucks and I hate it!!!,5
Excellent job  on handling the‚Ä¶,Nothing but issues. Card kept getting declined and I couldn‚Äôt even pull the money out of atm,5

Love my anytime alerts,"I had to cancel my debit card due to a fraudulent charge on it, I opened a new ALL Access debit card the same day. No one told me that my savings and debit account wouldn't be transferred over to the new account. I had to get a no pay charge on a monthly account. Then after calling, only a  partial amount was transferred, had to call back and transfer the rest. The old account is still open and charging me  $5.00 maintenance fee for a account I can't use any longer. The entire process was nerve wracking and I had not called Netspend's customer service  as many times as I had to over a 3 day course since I joined in 2016.  The text alert somehow isn't the same as it was with my regular debit account.  After each transaction, deposit, refund, any action on that account, I received a text alert, now with this All Access account, I have to request a balance, last transaction, deposit, or anything.  The point in signing up for the text alert is to immediately automatically know and see what is happening with your account.  That's how I knew about the fraudulent transaction on my account. So far I am not happy with this All Access account that Netspend has been raving about online. They have to show me the advantages of having this account.",4
Quick and great speedy service provided.,I like  Net Spend card because they don‚Äôt charge to much money when each month and they take their time explaining what the problem is,5
Been using this service for years,Ehe best of the best. I recommend big time,5

Cards work good,I enjoy the service provided by Netspend.

I have had an account with Netspend for‚Ä¶,"If I could give one star to their customer representative service, I would! I have been trying to call them to help me activate my card for literally 3 hours, their stupid website doesn't work on desk top, if you want to activate your card you have to do it using your phone browser and NONE OF THE 15 REPRESENTATIVES I WASTED MY TIME TALKING TO TOLD ME! It was my wife who came up with the idea to use the phone browser. I 100% DO NOT recommend!",1
NetSpend us awesome,NetSpend it's a very good prepaid card alot of people take also very easy to use,5
fees are high but everything else is‚Ä¶,I've never delt with such a difficult bunch of people I had three very small charges on my NetSpend card they were not my charges so the amount was not known by me so the customer service rep said they would not be able to help me!,4
This the best card I use in my life‚Ä¶,NetSpend is the worst used my card at gas pump and all the money in my account was taken and someone stole my phone And sent about 3000 to someone and they won't give back my money..,3
The reason I love NetSpend is because I‚Ä¶,It's really easy to do anything with this card.Thanks alot,5
Not bad so far my rlfrust check should‚Ä¶,"Charging 1.50 every time you spend your money you paid already to put on there, won't use it again in less no other option which there's alot of different ones now.",5
I have one word that describes how I‚Ä¶,So far I'm very happy with Net Spend I'll also reccomend Net Spend to Other Personal thank you .,4

Very happy with my card.,I started using netspend as a secondary acct. But now its my main acct. I get my paycheck early like alot of the others but this acct.  Is more like a traditional chk acct. At a bank which is extremely useful for certain types of banking transactions.  Its simple to add cash which you couldn't do at all with my other online bank,5
I have no problem with NetSpend because‚Ä¶,"You guys made it possible to add a payment card under my name and remove other previous troubled cards from my PayPal account and brought its status back to active. Now the Netspend card works on PayPal anywhere/everywhere and everything is fixed! I may switch to PP card because there is no upload cash fee with a card, otherwise I'd use Netspend forever and still will as my backup debit.",5
Good,They did an incredible job,5
I get charged 1.50 every time I use the‚Ä¶,"I never did debit cards, or buying things online. But when my I got a text message saying that my taxes had came in on my NetSpend app, literally two days earlier I have a renewed trust in the banking system and am glad that my only debit card, and the FIRST debit card that I've ever used in my life has left me 100%  completely satisfied thank you.",5
Monthly fee is high and not comparable‚Ä¶,This card just charges too many fees. I can use cash app or pay pay without paying crazy fees to use or get my money.,1
I love NetSpend,I use the apps Uber and Lyft to take rides to and from work they process the payment by putting it as pending until a few days have passed and then it goes through I had several payments that were pending at which point I happen to overdraft my account by just a couple dollars less than 10 definitely less than 10 and because of this they paid him all five payments late after my last negative payment has gone through and I received six negative overdraft fees for $20 each I will be taking my money I‚Äôll direct deposit from this account and closing it because that is crazy and I refuse to do business with anybody who would charge me that much from pending charges,4
Am happy with the service,The only problem I had is with the app it‚Äôs super slow and it was frustrating checkin my account other than that the card is easy to load and it sends alerts to my phone every time a transaction is made. I will definitely use it in the future but I‚Äôd like to see some improvements made to the app.,5
NetSpend is Awesome!,I love Netspend they are a great company and is a great way to use a credit card online. They have great staff that always accommodates you and whatever obstacles your facing.  Thank you Netspend.,4

I had $40 left on my card,"you set me up 1.50 for every transaction I have I have direct deposit and all access cards as well since Jan I've paid 200.00 in just using my card at a store, not including atm fees. I need corporate to reserve this fee asap. I'm a single mother I can afford to give cents away. please keep me customer moving forward I will close both my accounts with direct deposits coming in asap.thank you,lindsey",5
Netspend is good,The monthly fee is ridiculous because I have $1600 a month going into this account. I will be leaving Netspend.,4
There are a lot of cards that don‚Äôt‚Ä¶,I love love love having my NetSpend Card.,5
Good and great,I have never had a card online that works any better than NetSpend I ordered me another card and I'm going to try to keep them full and use both of them that's how I depend on them and like them,1
I had a problem with my PayPal,Netspend is OK. So far. They have not yet screwed anything up. But I have very little confidence in Netspend. The web interface is wonderful for ten years ago but lacking in usability design and feature common on modern web sites. Support is barely adequate at being able to shift blame and not be helpful. It would be easier to be better. I hope they improve after all the difficulty in setting up the account.,5
so easy to use and send and receive‚Ä¶,"Pretty damn good card, easy to use with all the right stuff",5
Awesome,I've had NetSpend for a few years I like it very much. The only one thing I do dislike is not being able to pull out more than 200 per day.,5
I‚Äôve been with Netspend for years,You all canceled my card for no reason and that screwed me big time so ya not happy,5
Netspend is great to use,"When you send alerts, you click on them and it takes you to web site, doesn't give you chance to read them. Also you sent new card that doesn't match the account I had, now I have two accounts and no card for the original one.",5
It's a good card just didn't know they‚Ä¶,Netspend locked my account to my unbeknownst. It‚Äôs stressful to gave to stop and submit manual paperwork to get back into my account. I will never use Netspend again in my life!!!,4
NetSpend was a godsend for me,Never have had better experience,4
good product,"Decent card, haven't seen any hidden fees yet",5

NetSpend,No complaints very good!,5
My service from Netspend is awesome,"I have had great experience, for the most part. The reason for 3 stars, is the fees. I can't afford to use netspend for everything. They charge $3.95 to load up to a certain amount. Then $1.50 for every transaction. I use it only if I need to pay for something big, don't have enough money on my other debit card. I actually have had a netspend card for many years. Never used it much, because of the fees way back when I first got it.",4
Alertness where it counts,"Y'all r doing good, but everyone could use some improvement",5
Always on point,I have had nothing but really positive experiences with NetSpend.,5
Love it,Excellent love that we're able to go to different businesses to reload the card.,5
Netspend has helped me in More Ways‚Ä¶,"If zero stars was a choice, I would rate Netspend a 0. Charging me an extra fee of $1.50 on EVERY charge, not just monthly which is ridiculous in it's own right but understandable. In 2018, on my first account, I was only charged once a month and only if there was money in my account. Now, even on a $1.00 charge, I'm charged an extra $1.50! Yeah, zero stars...",5
I am waiting on the results of my‚Ä¶,I give NetSpend five stars because they're on time they're sufficient and professional.,5
Okay service,So far my experience has been great!! Easy and convenient to load!! Didn't appreciate the extra charge added by the shipper/supplier üò°üò° Hopefully this isn't commen practice,4

On another occasion I purchased a cheap item from Kroger that only cost .25 cents (a pack of Kool-aid) solely for the purpose of getting cash back. You guys charged  me $1.50 for a ,25 cents  purchase .....unbelievable!!!!  This is a travesty!  You guys are simply put....high level criminals  and I'm very, very disappointed in the mediocre service provided!   Word pf mouth is a powerful thing and I'm going to implement it!  Honestly, you deserve (0) stars.  I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND NETSPEND TO ANYONE!!! YOU SUCK!~Greater in HE that is in ME!Kimberly Gray, RN",5

just started useing this card,Transferring funds from your bank account or any other bank linked takes days to do when cash app can do it within seconds and it sucks because I really like NetSpend it helps me save money because I can't touch it for a while but when I need money and a different account I can't depend on NetSpend because it'll take days to do,5

Services slow,NetSpend is next best thing to have if you are denied a bank account. It alerts me each transaction and my money loads immediately. The only downside is the monthly fee. We are charged for loading money. We can only get money from those with a NetSpend card. Let's not make it difficult to receive money from anyone.,4

I love this card very professional,"I did not ask for this card. I did not want this card.

As soon as it is spent the card will be cut up and I will never use this company again",3

However with THAT being said, l probably WON'T keep/use this card...lm only allowed to put $500 @ a time on this card and l need to be able to put at LEAST a $ 1,000 at a time....as it charges me TO PUT money on it. Besides that it would be an awesome card to have",5

Not a real bank!!,These pre paid cards help out a lot an are easy to load,5
Ffff,Awesome! The direct deposit is so fast.,2
Quick,I get my 2 days faster,5
I had no problems these last 7 years‚Ä¶,NetSpend All Access has been a great experience with the service and overdraft protection it helps you if you're running a little short on cash. I suggest trying NetSpend above all these other online Banks.,5
I loved the service,"I had contact because of withdrawal at ATM,it was resolved very well explained, good customer service, easy fix, Thank You NetSpend",5
It very good I get more friends to‚Ä¶,$1.50 is too much to charge for each transaction. You guys must be incredibly rich. And 2.95 for atm withdrawals. Really???,4

Still have not got my 119.00 and 21.00‚Ä¶,NetSpend Has been a life saver from getting paid early to sending money to paying my bills it has been quite the professional experience THANK YOU NETSPEND,1

Excellence,The worst company I have ever done business with. To exclude me from Netspend  after my card was stolen and used to make unauthorized purchases was uncalled for. I have no way to find out the status of my dispute for over $600.Will never recommend Netspend and will fill complaint wit every agency I can find. Besides this review I will review Netspend on other review platforms in just as negative way possible.Hope you go out of business.,5
I use it for several trans cash app,Awesome card. I love mine.,5
All I say they on point,"I called in to have a STOP PAYMENT on an upcoming transaction and was assured that it would not be deducted from my account. It happened anyway and when I called regarding this the agent was rude and cancelled my card, as well as cut off my access to my account!  I was in another country and did not have access to funds! She should be FIRED! That was the worse Customer Service I have ever experienced! I called back and spoke with another rep who was able to activate a card that I had ordered but never activated.  This is twice that my cards have been cancelled without my approval or notification that this is being done! I could have gotten stranded in another country with no money due to this problem! NOT AT ALL ACCEPTABLE! This resulted in my phone charges going through the roof because of International Calling!  I did not want that card cancelled because it was associated with business that would draft automatically! Not to mention the picture on the card was sentimental to me as it is of my now deceased dog of 12 years! Was not a happy camper!",5
Great customer service haven't had any‚Ä¶,Netspend is the best everyone needs to get done with them,5
They were very helpful and always able‚Ä¶,Awesome!! The best card I ever had in my wallet,5
"I like using my card,it shows my‚Ä¶",Netspend/western union all access is one of the best you can count on.  They are easy to load and they have a great customer service.  I'm glad they stand up to and beat any other cards that I have used in the past.  I recommend that if you are always using western union you need to get this card.  You will save lots of money.    Happy customer Mark Metcalf,5
The only problem I have is every time I‚Ä¶,FIVE STARS AND AN EXTRA STAR.,5
Doing a amazing job,Just like a normal bank and they have really good features,2

Great app and card,I have to say they have impressed me very much so Netspend that is. I these people have been there to help me even when I felt so helpless anyway but it will show in the five stars I'm giving them what they can and will do for their customers. Let's Go Netspend!,1

Also thank you for sending my replacement card free of charge and so fast.",3
i get my paycheck a day earlier and it‚Ä¶,"I love NetSpend for the great service that you provide for me,and how you capture the whole protection of my money and others. Thank you.",5
Best card out there!!!,Awesome card wouldn't have any other card,5
My service is always fast and easy.,I had my income tax return return direct deposited an account I recently applied for.  Although if I had read the long long rules regulations o would have withdrawn it out at once or transferred it to a Bank account. I literally had no idea that everytime I used it for anything I was charged by the store and net spend..one time those fees were more than the purchase. Not to mention the internet purchases that don't take debit yet took it unbeknowns to me. I realize all this is not your fault but I sure have learnt my lesson. I've lost over $100that I couldn't afford.,5
Always a pleasure to use Netspend,limits on what I can withdraw paired with atm fees is ridiculous,5
Netspend debit card registration,"I NEVER write reviews but decided to because I think EVERYONE needs to know how messed up NETSPEND is. They charged me an additional $1.50 every single time I swiped my card, which I didn‚Äôt notice for awhile. So if I spent $8.00 at McDonalds they charged me the $8.00 and then an additional charge of $1.50. If I spent $22.67 at Walgreens then NETSPEND charged me an additional $1.50 it didn‚Äôt matter that I wasn‚Äôt  pulling out cash either‚Ä¶. It was every single time I swiped my card. If I paid $1.00 for a candy bar they charged me an additional charge of $1.50‚Ä¶ needless to say I cut up my card and I will NEVER use NETSPEND again. If I could give negative stars I would!!!",5
I‚Äôve been hat using Netspend,Great services provided,5
Great card to have,I been really happy with the service and where ever I use my card,5
Why is it every time I reload the card‚Ä¶,Well what I can say is you guys are number one when it come down to security thank you.,5

I‚Äôm like because my payroll it‚Äôs‚Ä¶,I have yet to have a bad experience using NetSpend. App is user friendly along with the website.,5
worst card service of 2022,"I am a little discerned at the fact that my provisional money has not been put in my account.  I am a single mother with three children,  recently let go from my job due to the fact I didn't have reliable transportation and that money that was taken from me along with everything that identifies who I am was going to get me car so that I can go back to work to support my children and myself okay rent. My number is 803-995-3987 I can see the things I need to do with my family. Other than that I'm happy with the service. Thank you",5
Netspend has great intentions and means‚Ä¶,"I always use them to pay my monthly phone bill and it always goes on within 15 minutes from the time i load the cash,never any problems or delays",1

Probably the most hassle free card in my wallet,I really love my card so easy and convenient. Thanks NetSpend keep up the good work,5
I don't have direct deposit applied to‚Ä¶,I don't like NetSpend and will not be using it anymore. The reason is everytime I used my card I was charged $1.50 at least some other were more. Guess I didn't read the fine print. That will not be a problem for me any more as I will not be using NetSpend in the future,5
You have helped a great deal and have‚Ä¶,When transferring  money from one netspend to another netspend its stupid you can only do $250.00 dollars a day stupid.,1
Very easy to use and keeps up with‚Ä¶,Pretty efficient in transactions and customer service.,5
Easy to reload and use for doing‚Ä¶,Great card on!,5
Awesome,"Pretty shady to advertise no monthly fees with direct deposit and automatically put new card holders on a pay as you go plan with ridiculously high usage fees that you don't inform the customer of before they set up taxes to be direct deposited to.  YOUR NOTHING BUT THIEVES!!!!!!!  I still have yet to be refunded the first dispute over a ebike I ordered from what turned out to be a scam, never received email confirmation of having been shipped with the tracking number. From closer review I've also gone to the merchants that had multiple charges, signature transactions that almost mirrored my pin transactions, on the same dates but different times, so there's even more that the $99 dispute, and the $290 dispute. Your customer service representative refused to help me and have blocked me from any access to the card all together",5
I rather use NetSpend to pay bills or‚Ä¶,I've enjoyed all the features this bank has to offer! I've always gotten my paycheck 2 days earlier and whenever I spend money I set my account to always sende texts on my new available balance. They also sent me a text on when someone else tried to use my card number and stopped it right away! I put my trust into this bank.,5
I like next spend on most things but my‚Ä¶,I received my card and within a week someone had gotten my info and started to conduct business as if it were me.,5

I love this card fast and easy bank‚Ä¶,I like the convenience of being able to use my card any where.I wish there wasn't a per charge fee on each purchase.Also it would be nice to transfer money to non netspend card holders,5
When I buy something on line I get a‚Ä¶,"Is it a crime to deposit money in your own account?The person doing the transaction acted like if it was a crime depositing money to the card, asked fir my id in a really bad maner, checked picture and scaned it, why? If I go to the bank to deposit or take money out they do not do that.",5
Because can't use it at store to pay‚Ä¶,I've had a great experience receiving money and using my card to make purchases. Thanku netspend,4
Great job,I am disappointed that it takes nearly three business days to access money from my account after transfering. I  will go into a reload location to see if it's quicker.,1
I have Netspend for almost a year now,I'm overall happy except I'd like a chip in my card and a place to withdraw larger amounts of cash without fees,5

Great Service,It's a great program as long as everything works correctly. I've had cards canceled for no apparent reason and then the proof you require for identification can be very challenging to come up with. Also once or twice I've had received zero help from customer service which can be very frustrating. I had to purchase new cards in the past just to be able to use my funds. Also currently I'm having issues uploading my venmo to my account with no apparent reason why.,4

I was locked out of my account,"Meta bank withdrawal from my account which does not have my card number but they took over three almost $4,000 out of my account I don't believe that they are trustworthy and I and I just don't understand what how could they let that much money go through without my approval there was no signature loan on it but I don't know what company that took the money and they say they're going to do an investigation but still not only one account I mean not only one charge they took it out of like three or four different charges even when they told me the car was cut off there was still an account or payment that went through they should not have ever went through without my signature or my approval so they're not trustworthy that just take your money and you get a little small one for $34 and they cut your card off automatically without you",5
Never got the money two days early ATM‚Ä¶,"Someone took 243.00 from my card, I reported it, I had to wait over 2 weeks just to be notified ""the money was withdraw from the same ATM you normally withdraw money."".  I got no pictures of the person withdrawing my money, even though I requested it.  I called within a couple of minutes from the time I received the text message.",1
Because I hate how you guys say you can‚Ä¶,"I love netspend,knowing my money is safe and always on time with quick notification of all purchases.",4

So I contacted NetSpend and told them it was me that did so the account was unlocked so I tried to make online purchase once again and now it's locked and now I'm forced to show my ID, Social Security and proof of address? Even though I literally made sure to clarify it was me attempting to make a online purchase.",5

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY NETSPEND THEY GET‚Ä¶,So far so good. Was able to set up the card and change my pin very easily. Without jumping through hoops. Plus I love the fee charged per purchase instead of a flat fee per month.  I am better able to gadge my financial expenditures better.,1
Very happy,"NetSpend is not what I thought it was.  When I checked to use the card, out of approximately$50, I  had approximately $6.00 left.    Therefore, I realized this was not for me. I called to find out what happened.  I found out that approximately$6.99 was taken off the card every month.  For any transaction that is processed, $6.99 is taken, mind you even a refund when you close the account.",5
Excellent customer service ty,"If I had my diligence in reading the fine print, I would have opted out.The fees are.* Not good*.$5 monthly(This when I direct deposit two large amounts a month.The ATMs they say they have are incorrect, .",5
I like NetSpend but you guys limit my‚Ä¶,$1.50 per transaction...$2.50 ATM FEE....How is this card helping ANYONE? Very expensive card to use. I'll stick with CHIME and MetaBank Flare,5
The over draft feature is horrible and‚Ä¶,Netspend is easy-to-use debit card that works everywhere they accept Visa cards also reloading is a breeze I didn't have no problems reloading my netspend card like other cards that give me a hassle. Overall I would recommend netspend to others that need a debit card you can trust to be hassle free.,3

I wish your security was better‚Ä¶,"This company is beyond ridiculous in fees. They charge you every time you make any type of purchase or transaction, they charge you a monthly fee , & they charge you to add cash. I would never recommend this bank to anyone. I currently have netspend and I hate it I have to pay a monthly fee and I still get charged per every transaction. An absolute rip off.",5

It's beneficial to have netspend and‚Ä¶,Your ripping people off charged me 76 dollars for 17 dollars of gas and kept the money then you charged me over 30 dollars every single time I used my card so I spend 15 dollars you would charge me 45 and keep the 30 scamers rip offs,3

Its good but I don't like how y'all‚Ä¶,"...great customer service! As soon as I needed the Netspend team they were there! I had filled out one of those (*come to find out BOGUS) ""free iPhone survey"" things. Yaay! I thought, because I had friends who were sent a free iPad/ iPhone, I hit the jackpot! So, pay $2 for shipping.  Ok. Turns out they tried to charge me $6+!! I got a txt from Netspend and was able to put a stop to this 'bait-n-switch"" practice!

So far my experience has been very‚Ä¶,I love receiving my pay checks 2 days early,3

Every time I have any kind of problem‚Ä¶,The woman that took my call wouldnt listen to anything I was saying and then cancelled my card even though I needed the money I had on it to get home. So I ended up stranded hundreds of miles from home with no money for several days!,4
Problem with bill pay,Loveing so good can't what tell I'd get teafure card so I'd put money on from my PayPal account but it still good have something put money onto,5
Good customer service!!,Great u don't tell what and how to say it,2
No complaints so far ev√©ry the only‚Ä¶,"It's good ,but I don't like that of you have a transaction you have to pay a price, when your locked out of your account",5
Nothing special,When you add money you can't put in over 500 without a double charge. This was at Meijers in Lafayette In.,4
Good service,To learn about life within itself,3
I think when I spoke with customer‚Ä¶,Netspend is excellent,5
I enjoy you guys üëç,My experience has been average. The company must make money but the fees are a little high.  Not enough to defer me from using the service. So far so good.,5
I iove your service.,Excellent customer service and great online banking so I can see where or how much is available at any given time plus the fact I get paid one day ahead of normal playdate which is great for unexpected purchases,5
Doing good keep it up,I have nothing to complain about thus far.,5
A must have!,I enjoy using my all access netspend .. the over draft features Allow me to stay current with bills and not Run out gas ..,5

I enjoy using my NetSpend card,"Great  to have  ,better than buying gift cards",3
Was great getting a update on balance‚Ä¶,Nice card works well,5
I had reported my card‚Ä¶,So far it‚Äôs been difficult to use and takes forever to transfer and be able to transfer. I‚Äôve been a member for over a month and I‚Äôve only been able to transfer $200. Not worth it. Will be taking my money someone else.,5
For me netspend is great.,Fantastico! Mucho excellente üëå,4
It was very good,Always quick and easy,5
Thank you,I've been with NetSpend over 20 years but now you have the All Access NetSpend I don't like it it charged $5 a month for what I ain't got no design no nothing on my card tell no get one star,5

Very good and fair banking and most‚Ä¶,Not restrictive at all,5
Way toooooo many fees,Its good really resourceful,5
Love them,The 1.50 fee every time I use it is ridiculous.,1
Haven't had a problem so far been using‚Ä¶,Good service.  Makes things so much easier for me.,5
Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to use the features‚Ä¶,Netspend all access is the best bank for me. Customer service is very helpful and on point. They keep their word when it's a problem with your account and I get paid 2 to 3 day's early.,5
They are very helpful.,This is a good app and I like it,4
I have a friend that referred me,I appreciate NetSpend for allowing me to be able to perform transactions that I normally would not be able to make.,5
Embarrassed at walmart,Really like having this nice getting paycheck early,5
NetSpend was by the worst experience‚Ä¶,All I have to say is this is the best card I ever had and I had it for years (over 15 years)with no problems at all,3
It sucks,I love net spend. Best debit card services I‚Äôve ever dealt with,1
I love NetSpend I get my money two days‚Ä¶,The agent was very kind and listened to what transpired with my account and fixed what he could to the best of his ability. He was very knowledgeable and explained very well. Five Stars for him.,1
Over the traditional banks which hold‚Ä¶,"Hello wonderful people at NetSpend! Let me begin by saying the experience with y'all had been amazing. When I began my job 3 years ago, I didn't have a bank account so I opened one here. I love the direct deposit, especially when I get paid on Thursday and my pay date isn't until Sunday.  I used to have to pay .50 or $1 for purchases til I realized that I could pay $5 a month and so that was my only complaint. This year when it came to my taxes I had it deposited directly to my NetSpend account. Since I have 2 cards both my husband and I are able to access it. Thank you for working for the people who struggle everyday for their money and helping us learn to bank without all the hassles!",5
Keep up the great work,The things I really need I'm able to get with know hassle,5
I love it to start saving my money this‚Ä¶,"It‚Äôs fine as a back up card /app to use but i personally don‚Äôt like it there are cards that you can get with out the fees or charging you for your own money , for example everytime I make a purchase or transfer money into another account (apple pay/ cashapp/etc) , Netspend takes an additional $1.50+ off my card for spending MY money? If I decide to switch my fee plan so that it won‚Äôt take additional money off I‚Äôll still have to pay $10+ dollars every month in fees to me that‚Äôs ridiculous because I‚Äôve had a couple cards that don‚Äôt do that for example chime, cashapp, robins financial credit union, Dave , Klover , PayPal) there are a lot more options than what Netspend offers 2/10 I wouldn‚Äôt recommend",4
I like it,Thanks for giving me the opportunity to try it company's offers,5
great,"NetSpend itself is all over great I can use it for purchases but do not use it for for a credit purchases because it will charge you a $1.50 fee which I think is ridiculous. If you use it for debit and you have to put in your PIN then usually it won't charge you a $1.50 fee but sometimes it still does so watch it closely.  Otherwise getting my direct deposit early is amazing.  Depending on where you live though, finding a fee free ATM is a pain.",5
Money seem to always leave my account‚Ä¶,"There is just know respectable, receptionists, with trying to help a client,and the robot machine should be upgraded, because it doesn't have a number to push just for speak to a receptionist, also one rude person ,hung up on me,,I keep saying move to another card like Capitol one card basically u get your card a few days before like netspend, but no fee to take out money BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT IS COMUNICATION",5
Cust service,I use it to get direct deposit in the works great days early,1
Can't use the car for Venmo to add‚Ä¶,This card its awsome I pay my phone bill and easy to put money and ready to use. Thank you Netspend.,5
Charges you per months,NetSpend has been very efficient and has dealt with any issue that has came up.,1
I like to try the best,I‚Äôve been using Netspend for sometime now and love the new updates to where I can keep up with my balance and not overdraft.,1
NetSpend is very good,I have use net spend for about10 years and I love it.,5
Keeping my money safe thank you Netspend,Netspend charges $1.50 per transaction. This takes away a lot of money from your card and this is unfair. Very unhappy with this card,5
Thanks,Customer Service has always been a cut above... Problems are quickly resolved.,5
I like it quick and easy to use fees‚Ä¶,All I had was a simple question ‚Äúhow much money can I pull from the ATM a day‚Äú? My question was answered thoroughly by a guy named Richard.,1
Very satisfied!!,Very convenient and every time I had a situation that need help with . Your team was able to resolve it for me quickly.,5
great I can complain,I tell everyone how great this company is and it really helps that they give you texts that says what you spent and how much you got left in your account and getting my SSI early really helps me out,5
Great service,I have never had fraud happen on netspend until now,5

Good iverall,I'm still getting used to the card. But love the running balance tracker texts,5
Net spend is super helpful to me each‚Ä¶,"I used my card at loves gas station and paid at pump ....I got 10 dollars worth of fuel ...but it took 60 out and still haven't gone t that one back, And I'll hen I when to shell and paid at pump it does the same thing , always takes out way more and then a week or two goes by and it puts some back on it......I don't recommend anyone pay at pump!!!!",4

The automated system doesn't always‚Ä¶,"crappy service, they lied about getting paid earlier than my normal pay day LIED, cant review my own banking information!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",4
Good card,Every time you withdraw money it takes a percentage and it adds up,3
I would like that when they promise‚Ä¶,"You cannot reach the agents quickly on the Phone.When you talk with an Agent sometimes you cant understand them. They need to speak slowly and clearly. Netspend fees are getting to high, Yall should do away with the purchase fees. Also make the ATM where Netspend Cards are accepted & Free more acessible.",5
Worst Company,The worse experience I've ever had they have lied to me about returning my money to the veterans administration in which they haven't they are rude..will not go off their scripts and have taken me for alot of money put in a claim did everything they asked and not a response not not anything and certainly none of my money..on either access. Yes I was stupid enough to have both my ssdi and VA benefits direct deposited and had to close the acct. Cause they refused me accessed to my money for such a dumb reason I don't feel like typing the explanation it had to do with the phone number on my acct. Was not registered in my name in the United States what the fudge,5
Great!,You didn't secure my account,1
Easy to use and manipulate money‚Ä¶,"Really, it's been very very good. Just wish I would have found the NetSpend card earlier lost a lot of money on other cards. Your establishment seems to be in perfect order.",5
Great nothing bad or new to day,Great service awesome feedback and all,5
my card was hacked,im happy until now except for a representant that was a bit like a robot and i won feel comfortable she was just to the point without any explanation i get a little disappointed  about that situation Thank you  SincerelyRoberto Garcia,5
Efficient,Easy! Plus I get my paycheck 2 days earlier! I like that we have to pretend checks so I never lose track of money I've spent!,5
Works for me,Want to talk to someone that understands what I'm talking about and not be rude,5
First of all I never lost my card I‚Ä¶,I‚Äôve been with netspend for at least 3 years I love it it‚Äôs fast and easy and I gave my money in minutes no hassle if with banks won‚Äôt go anywhere else,5

Too many fees.,"my father says that you get what hyou pay for.  for exmple they have so many fees. after reading i didnt agree to all these fees.  of course if its just a monthly fee i would agree.  compared to the amount that i paid so far this month .  compared to last month.  i paid to load the card.  i paid to load the card , i paid to use the card",4

The text banking never fails to let me know when i spend money or have money added. I havent had any issues and i get paid 4 days earlier than others i work with. All around awesome!,4
Beneficial,I love my NetSpend card. It is a great way to have a debit card with direct deposit without having all the hassle of opening a bank account. I love that my money is my money to spend and I don't have to have a minimum amount in my account for it to stay open.,1
Steven Moore March the 17th $500 was‚Ä¶,The only thing I would have to change is the 1.50 fee you charge when you use the card now a days every penny counts,4
Easily got my Irs refund check direct‚Ä¶,I like netspend  I get paid two days early the only thing I don't like is the overdraft plan it should give you more money than ten dollars,5
It's good,I get direct deposit SSI. On January 28th I got my check for February. Somehow somebody got into my account and took out 40199. I called and disputed but it was still pending so I didn't actually get to speed until February 2nd. Now you are all tell me I have to wait till May 2nd for an answer I can't get any of my money back. This is unacceptable for a bank. I live in New York whoever did this was in California. I know nobody there. I was told it was in 24 to 84 hours I would know an answer what was going on that's a lie. And then I was told that I would proud I would be able to get some of my money while it was being disputed and that was a lie. This is unacceptable for a bank.,5
This card is everything they said it‚Ä¶,It's ridiculous ingot charged a five dollar monthly fee after one day of having an account with y'all. It's absurd. What if I decide I don't want to bank with y'all before a month hit. That seems very scammer like to me.,4
My new card came fast enough but there‚Ä¶,Great job thank netspend you have came through for me .thank you .,5
I don't usually give the highest rating‚Ä¶,Thanks Netspend you are very needed and right on time with your awesome services.,3

I like the card,Great but one thing is I‚Äôm not getting my direct deposit in 2 days I been getting it the night before,5
I think it's an excellent card to have,I talked to reps on 214 215 with social security on phone they had us put the wrong account number into my portal so now I have to wait for my social security for another 7 to 10 days and I've had no income since December of 2020 NetSpend is the worst company I've ever dealt with I'm losing my life insurance I've had for 30 years cuz of this and I can't move out of this house that I'm living in with black mold that's killing me you people are disgusting ratchet and once this is done I will never use you again,4

I like  my netspending account.,I've been and continue to be a client since 2009. I ve never had an issue or problem that was not resolved in literally minutes or after a phone call. I completely love doing all my banking with  All access/Netspend/Metabank.  I recommend this bank and their services to everyone.,5
First off i‚Äôd like to say i do love‚Ä¶,I love my new Netspend card. It was very easy to have it activated and even easier to set up a direct deposit account for my income taxes this year. My state return came 3 days sooner than I expected and I even got a text message telling me that it had been uploaded to my card. I didn't have to make a bunch of calls to find my refund like I've had to with previous prepaid cards. Netspend didn't even charge me some outrageous fee for the direct deposit account either. I would definitely recommend netspend to my friends and family.,4
Customer service is very helpful when‚Ä¶,Netspend has not failed me yet.  It came at a great time.  I am able to do my shopping and bill paying without interrupting my bank account.  I can shop online with ease knowing there is no way I can get into a jam or get extra charges on my card.  I just load the amount needed with extra for transaction fee and i'm good to go.,1
I've always had great customer service‚Ä¶,It's fast and convenient. No fees to activate the card plus it comes in handy so it's worth having I must say.,5

Excellent i love it thank you,Netspend is the best no problems whatsoever,5
Don‚Äôt have any complaints so far so‚Ä¶,I got my state but still haven't got my federal,5
Hasn't helped me at all..,I cut up my Rush credit card that iv been using for over 10 years with the ingo app. Its much simpler on Netspend app. I havnt had call customer service yet for anything yet. Im sure yall actually have real people answering the phone. Rush must have some super secret codes of tricks to get help from them. Mabey im just not cool enough for them and they have secret meetings and make fun and laugh at me cause im a loser. Who knows what kind of wierdo stuff they got going or into over there.   So thank u Netspend and if u happen to see Mr. Rush tell him to eat a bowl of male reproductive organs. Boom !! Now who‚Äôs got the secret meetings Rush ?? Ohh yeah our meetings are Tuesdays 2:45. I got lots of ideals of Rush hating stuff. See if u can find out Mr Rushes address so i can wrap his house and put a burnig bag of poop on there door step. Thank u my new friend Netspend !! Glad i gave it a try. RushCards are for sissys & danderphyliacs !!!,5

Been with NetSpend for years and have‚Ä¶,"Awesome card to use , a lot of nice perks, and extremely secure.",1
Did not fix my issue.,Hate calling there no one speaks good English they don't even understand your problem and are no help at all the worst service from a card company a child could do better.,5
Everything went great,Great card and really good customer service,2
I have been using NetSpend for a while‚Ä¶,"I like everything about Netspend, it provides excellent security to your account, notifies me of any transaction or alert, I wish the card came with a chip, but overall I love Netspend",5
Been using this account for years.I‚Ä¶,For most things netspend is good but you should be able to use to send money with venmo and PayPal this is very incon enient,5
I have no problem using my Netspend‚Ä¶,Someone with direct deposit could get a break on the fees.,5
19....stars,To be completely honest I liked Netspend the first year I had it and to be honest I have been looking for a new card company because you guys could be doing so much better with helping people that have been with Netspend through years for example give out or help out with getting loans/personal loans or give them a bigger overdraft amount I am a single father of three with an autism son when you have to be a single father after their moyher passing away and you have no support but you know that your card company will let you overdraft but at the same time it‚Äôs not enough just to get diapers or wipes or even juice for my kids I pay my overdraft balance every week and when I have to overdraft more I can‚Äôt and it‚Äôs not fair I have been a loyal hard holder I hope that things change and things can get better from hear I would love to stay with you guys you guys need to change things fast and try to do it so you can help the people that have been committed to Netspend and I am one of them people I would love to stay with you guys but when I need more help it would be great to have more options and I think if somebody is with Netspend for over two years you should be able to offer them a loan out for at least $1500 or so I think that would be a great opportunity for us customers/card holders,5
It can not be used with most autopay‚Ä¶,GREAT EXPIRENCE WITH NETSPEND. THANK YOU FOR ALL WHAT YALL DO FOR PEOPLE.,5
Satisfied with the outcome thanks üòäüëç,"I  AM HAPPEN TO USE YOU CARDS, I LIKE USING IT THANK YOU LET HAVE ONE.",3

Straight BS,"I use my Netspend card when I am traveling so that way, I don't have to worry about someone getting access my checking or credit card information.All they would is the amount I have on my Netspend card.",4
I'm A Longtime Netspend Cardholder!,It was very confusing to me in the beginning because I received the Netspend card and after I activated it then I received the All Access Netspend card with a different card number. I am using the Netspend card now because I am still not sure about the All Access card. It‚Äôs just confusing to me.,1
Love customer service,I got direct deposit.  Been with yoll for years like 7. Why my overdraft only 150? I should at least get 300,5

"Great job and very helpful,",I will never use a traditional bank again. Your CSR‚Äôs are exceptional!,5
I feel comfortable with this prepaid‚Ä¶,too many promotions. Long delay with check clearing and exorbitant services fees,5
Horrible experience,I don't have any complaints. I've been genuinely happy with netspend. I do have a suggestion and I'm sorry if this is inappropriate. I pay a fee as I go as opposed to $5 month because I had method that worked for me that didn't go over $5. I did have more money in my account than usual and spaced out the fees for using your card. It would have been nice to get a message as a reminder for the fees generated. A suggestion that the$5 would be better for the time being would've saved me quite a bit of money. Thats my only concern or suggestion that I have for netspend.,5
Too many fees,I did an online survey (for SUPPOSEDLY cosco) for the survey I was offered a‚Äòfree gift‚Äô for the cost of shipping which was to be $6.99 when I put my card in they TOOK $90 I canceled that card and ordered another one it was OVIOUSLEY a scam because I could not access the page after they took my money now I NEED my money but it‚Äôs taking forever to be resolved I‚Äôm very disappointed Lawrence Hamilton üíïüëë,1

Money talks with help,Fee'sWatch how this card is set up because if it's set on a per fee transaction at a dollar and fifty cents a transaction on top of any other atm fee it get expensive fast even cash back on an over the counter transaction costs three dollars plus the dollar fifty. This can eat up a lot of money fast especially if you don't watch your statement.,1

It's an amazing card,"The things that I've been through with the customer service staff is highly disgusting. NET SPEND services blocked my card when calling in a explaineing that I was over charged at an establishment so I asked to dispute a matter next thing I know I get a Notification to my mobile device  stating that my card has been Blocked. I never asked for the customer service rep a Net spend to Block my card nor re send another card However they just assumed. I was told In order to receive my funds right away that was initially on my card that got Blocked that I needed to go Purchase another Netspend card to transfer my funds over.. Now the tricky part is once doing so ever since I call to transfer my funds they all given me a difficult time transferring my funds that I've worked for Netspend WITH HELD MY FUNDS FROM ME told me when I was attempting to transfer my 1,165.35 to the other card acct. that they told me to go Purchase Netspend placed a hold on my card to where although I could not access my funds they Never transferred my funds I spoke with customer service reps allday on 2/11/22 when reps placed me on hold once I asked for the Supervisor I was on hold for 40  minutes each time to the point I felt as though they were insulting my intelligence and playing these petty games with me I never spoke with not One Supervisor when asked can. I would Never in my got damn life ever refer anyone to Netspend Ever they are very Unprofessional play these petty spiteful games and I am fed up to the point first thing Monday I will and I mean I will be contacting my attorney on behalf of this Company that's a Joke. Last but not least I still have not received my funds bc Netspend will not Release my funds that I've worked blood sweat and tears behind Netspend is very Unprofessional they all barely speak any English and are very Inconsiderate.

That being said, in reference to your card services; wouldn't choose you again. It took 2 days from when I received my card, to access the money, 3 days to get the app to reflect my funds. When I called customer support, the operator was so stuck on his script, or whatever troubleshooting manual that was indoctrinated that he was unable to conceptualize my individual problem...It wasn't that bad of service, It was just enough hassle to grab another banks card next time...",5
Received the card fast,But when you paying bills it should show confirmation that it has sent,5
Pshttt,I love this card because it lets me get paid early,4
Been a customer of Netspend for 10‚Ä¶,Good..........,4
I gave it a good review because they‚Ä¶,Because my money ain't on my card like it don't have the right account and routing number,5
I have always got great customer‚Ä¶,I was needing a second account to put extra spending money in and this is perfect for vacation or whatever the need. Thanks,4
Good,"I have nothing say but good things about NetSpend. If I have issues, their always there and easy to contact. You guys are awesome.",5
You have pay every time u by sum thing,"It's a good card to have.  The company let's you know if there's fraudulent transactions quickly, which is always good to know",5
Love netspend I've never had a problem‚Ä¶,"I was concerned about switching over to the access card because of direct deposit going to the original card. I had no reason for concern as the customer service agent I talked to was very confident and efficient in easing my mind. Thank you, Netspend.",2
It is what it is,I should be able to over draft with no charges added until that month is over,5
So far net spend seems ok,"If the option were available to give this company nothing but a bunch of negative stars that is definitely what I would choose. Ive never been so discouraged over a company in my life. What a freakin joke half of the employees are and they are rude and uneducated. You hear chickens in the background sometimes, then there are times when there are crickets chirping, or maybe that was the empty space in the persons head. I'M CLOSING MY ACCOUNT.",3
Been very helpful!,Two Stars why because every purchase they charge u either 2$ or 3$,4
Forgot to take money out of the atm,The people I spoke with were very helpful I'm happy,5
Yall said theres no monthly fees and i‚Ä¶,Had problem with direct deposit. My online account doesn't have information right.,5
a goock yeah.........,Wonderful card got money from stimulus and had no problem with it,4
Don't like-new fees,"Seems each time I use my card to make a purchase,  i am charged.  At this rate,  why bothet?",3
Will Netspend have cards with a chip?,Amazing fancy and very efficient I love thank you I really enjoy MetaBank thank you so much for this great opportunity I want to stay with betaflight for a long time,4
Great reviews on net spend willbit be‚Ä¶,Very happy with card and options thank you,4
It's all goodsi far wish gt paid‚Ä¶,Great card just wish overdraft fee was cheaper and wish they offered a bonus for direct deposit setup,5
All Good,They charge you for every transaction you do plus an additional fee for pulling out money will no longer use this card I thought it was like skylight Netspend they don‚Äôt charge you for every transaction you do only to take out money which is reasonable.,4
So far,This is a good service place,5
Love this card .haven't had a single‚Ä¶,"You froze my account, made me get a new card, and change my password.  I couldn't pay my bill I was using it for because I couldn't use my money until the new card arrived. And now I can't get into my account to activate the new card. So my money is stuck on a card a can't use. You suck.",5
I've had no problems at all buying‚Ä¶,Great Job! üëç,5
Great place to finetsnd all of your Movies‚Ä¶,Not very economical. You have to pay to put money on the card and then you also have to pay a fee for each transaction to use the card. Not worth it !,5
Excellent,love netspend. you are better than my checking with my bank,5
I‚Äôve been using Netspend for several‚Ä¶,I been with this company for many years since 2007 roughly and I have been through alot since then yet this company has been reliable and there to offer a solution to many a bump in the road if you are smart choose NetSpend.,5
"the best trio since except for, ( the big trio ), but the best next to them which can't be beat in my oppinion","I would give more stars, but there are things that could be better. The two main things are:Absolutely FREE card replacement when account locked. I've been charged even after being told I wouldn't be. And if transferring funds to self, there should be no limit set on amount to transfer.I like Netspend for many reasons, but it has been a hassle in the recent months. A lock on card is automatic if the company suspects fraud. I get the freeze on account, but give the account holder time to answer the question. And even then just block that transaction not the whole card. It takes time and effort to contact places and change card on file for bills and such.",5
This is wonderful Company with great‚Ä¶,Yes it's great to have NetSpend but it's even great if you can see the reload on line,4
Love getting paid a couple days early,"I had a card with another  company had a lot of trouble with it,yours seem to be a good one.",5
Love getting paid a couple days early,"Great easy loading , accepted by everyone . Only problem is $500 limit . Other than that it‚Äôs great .,",5
I'm extremely happy with NetSpend,"So far so good , I haven't had any trouble with netspend. The problems I have is some places that load the card don't do it any longer. Like on 92 nd stark Portland OR. I think someone needs to up date your list. Thank You.",5
I have been very satisfying and‚Ä¶,The csr's don't listen they continue to read a script,5
I have had a great experience so far,Customer service did a Great job. My card loaded fast and easy.,5
Love it,"Overall good job, in the end you always get it right.",5
Can't change my password no matter what‚Ä¶,"I NetSpend, cause I like to purchase Items online, like Amazon, eBay, Musicians Friend and Sweetwater. And submitting my music like CD Baby, Reverbnation. And Peacock, Paramount, Lifetime Movie Network and Nexflix.",5

I love it because I can add the card to‚Ä¶,Pleasantly surprised at ease of use and really like the text message feature. I have recommended your card to several. Keep up the good service.,5
Net spend was good,One of the best decisions i ever made was to get a Netspend card. I bought it for travel to a funeral and our rental car needed gas late at night and the only option was a automated/unattended gas station. Needless to say my children and I were saved by our Netspend card.,5
U all are great,Well I got my card by mail with name on it a balance of 41 bucks I registered it. Made a purchase worked fine text alert worked great well then tried to pay some bills got bills due on 11th gotta wait on a new card because of something that went wrong. Your agent wasn‚Äôt sure how to handle that so I have to wait 7 to 10 days to get a new card for payment of bills to be made was going to put check payment on your cards but would mad as crap to get to much money gone for 7 to 10 business days,4
TRY THE NETSPEND CARD,It‚Äôs great to use for work and other things,5
So far so good.,I get charged money to put money on the card and then again with every transaction on line. Greedy much?,5
I like you alot,I‚Äôve never had such great customer service than the Nestspend customer service ever!! I‚Äôm glad I chose Nestspend debit card!!,4
I absolutely hate it,"Love the card but to many fees,when I deposit money it'd a fee I take out money it's a fee.",5

So far so good,"netspend is better then the bank,, overdraft fees are unbelievably better and grace period is great... ill never use a different banking service",4
I have had the worst experience‚Ä¶,"They are reliable, but charge way too much to use your own money.",5
Horrible company,THE PEOPLE EMPLOYED AT THIS LOCATION ON LEXINGTON AVE IN EAST HARLEM ARE THE WORST. THEY ARE RUDE AND NEED A LOT OF TRAINING. JUST BECAUSE YOU WORK IN THE HOOD DOES NOT MEAN ALL IT‚ÄôS PEOPLE ARE TRASH.,1
Got my direct deposit started very‚Ä¶,I love the service no complaints what so ever,1
Great card easy to resovel issues an‚Ä¶,I love my card I have no problem with it Thanks you guys,5
It sucks im getting away from Netspend‚Ä¶,"My first time loading money on my Netspend card was very easy. I went in to the local Safeway store where I originally bought the card. A helpful cashier told me to swipe it on the card reader, which I did. This brought up the question ""Add funds?"" which I responded to with a yes, then ""How much?"" which I entered. I then paid the cashier the desired amount, my phone alerted me to the fact that the balance had changed, and I was off and running. So easy when you know how!",5
Enjoy,They are awesome and they helped me with everything,1
The customer service is great,I just hate that it's charging me for every purchase and moving money around,5
Great for my online purchase,This card has been working Great for me and I would refer any one to get themselves one.,4

It's really easy to find a reload‚Ä¶,This is the only place I cash my checks I love doing business with you people,4
Y'all could do better,A good card with decent customer service,5
Netspend covers all my banking needs,"I am not very happy with this card for the following reasons I went to the ATM at the casino and it said I reached my limit I hadn't even used the card that day so I had to go to the cashier where I had to pay a tremendous f e e. Then I went to the check cashing place where I got the car and tried to get $2,000 off of it and you guys charged me $60 to get $2,000 off of my car that's absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable so I do believe that I will be transferring over to another type of debit card. Any response of feedback that you guys can give me to improve this or show me a cheaper way to get money off of the car without having to spend my money please let me know thank you",4
Easy to manage,Really easy this time.Thanks,5

I think you need better easier ways to‚Ä¶,I have always appreciated the convenience of Netspend.,5
my review,I like it it could be a little better by having a option to add multiple options to add personal cards and have linked all together,3
I thought using a debit card to load‚Ä¶,I don't like that I have to pay 1.50 for each transaction.,4
Netspend is a good company.,Quite nice and excellent,1
Exceptional,I would give you no stars...I went on app to find free atm for spend it says moneypass that's a LIE and everytime I use my card you charge $1 or more...so with this being said I'M DONE WITH NETSPEND I'm cutting my card...SO STOP SENDING ME CARDS...you take ppls money,5
Fast,"Great card, tells me exactly where and when I use the card & also very secure. I recommend for sure...",5
Great Card,I like the convenience of the card and how easy it is reload.  Thanks,4
Finally a simple way to deal with money,Easy and convenient.,5
App not user friendly.,very horrible experience and you cant access your money,5
I try to put my card number in to see‚Ä¶,I love y'all business n overdrafts thanks for helping me out,2

I truly love Netspend,I don't got much to say I didn't have no problems at all,5
Thank you for all that you did for me,"It was hard for me to understand her, as the way she talks as I am not good at understanding someone with a Spanish accident plus she spoke very fast.Thank You",5
I have used NetSpend for a long time‚Ä¶,It‚Äôs dumb every time the card is used there is a $1.50 fee.   Will be getting away from Netspend as soon as possible,5
They do good,You are terrific! Simple and efficient. Thanks for being the best back up account.,5
Keep up good work,It‚Äôs a good company i recommended it,5
I think NetSpend is a great banking‚Ä¶,Great customer service,5
Good Jobüëç,I like this Netspend the only thing I don't like us having to $3.74 to reload. Western Union has locations that you can load funds on the card without paying a fee & the funds are available right away.,5
NetSpend cards are not a way to save money to put it shortly,"The reason, I‚Äôm putting my money on here are because I feel very safe in I trust Netspend I don‚Äôt trust anyone else I‚Äôm comfortable with net spend, with the security they also provide,and my securement with  my money with the FDIC backed up by the federal government. , that‚Äôs my protection",5
Great service,"Only reason I didn't give a 5 is because the person at the counter, was so extra nice and friendly joking and giggly with the person that was on front of me, maybe they knew each other im not sure, but I feel as if you should keep that same energy with everyone, when I stepped it was like she became humdrum and didn't really want to service me, but she still did her job, just didn't like the energy she gave me vs that person in front of me",1
Seems ok,it's okay but I have toakw two with draws every time I get money I should only have to do it once and I should be able to get as much as I want off my card,5
I'd like to see the chip implemented on‚Ä¶,I love this card. I use it to save Christmas money.,4
Everything was great signing up.,Just grateful I'll have the chance to receive money for whenever I can start working after becoming homeless. Thank you.,5
Great,"I dropped Netspend for another Bank, and I now realize it was a mistake that cost me alot of money. Now I am returning to Netspend dor better service and reasonable fees.",5
Your customer service is extremely‚Ä¶,"So helpful and quick service.  So convenient, they're located everywhere I go even traveling state to state NetSpend is available there too. Helping to keep my money safe!",5
I have been with netspend for a couple‚Ä¶,"I‚Äôve always loved how NetSpend was a super convenient alternative to traditional banking but I didn‚Äôt realize how many fees have been added since I used this service last. I literally can‚Äôt afford to pay a fee every single transaction, atm withdraws included. I also found it a bit inconvenient that I could send cash through services such as Cash App and Venmo but I couldn‚Äôt receive in order to load the account. The only way to load this account is either via Direct deposit from your workplace or going to a Convenience Store, which also‚Ä¶fee. Granted, I believe people use banking alternatives such as Netspend for a variety of reasons, but I can guarantee you none of them have the funds spend a fraction of their deposited money in fees. Aside from that I have NO other complaints. Customer care is amazing and the app is easy to navigate, which I appreciate.",1
Work really good,Very good just don‚Äôt like the charging to put money on your card,5
Great money is always in on time,So far you guys get a five star most definitely,5
The only thing I don't like is that you‚Ä¶,Love it easy to use helpful,5

Not bad,Netspend bend very helpful and good service. When I have any problems Net pend makes it right. They explain to me of any problems an why. Netspent keeps my account safe.,1
Great work,I like how your company has changed to meet my needs I appreciate the fact that no matter what's going on try to help me continue my account thank you,4
Horrible experience they don‚Äôt allow‚Ä¶,I like Netspend because my funds are available early,5
Netspend has been awesome to me for‚Ä¶,"I put money in my account to make a online purchase and my account was locked because net spend thought it to be unsafe, we‚Äôll net spend shouldn‚Äôt have the right to determine how I spend my money. It is my money. Very disappointed and will most likely never use netspend again.",1

Payments,Netspend is a great prepaid card. You get paid 2 days early. They offer great rewards,5
I am very happy with my NetSpend all‚Ä¶,Very helpful easy to work with wouldn't have any other way. Thank you,5
Been with Netspend for almost 4 yrs‚Ä¶,I like using the Netspend card because it gives you easy access to your money and it is deposit into your account 2 days before your money is deposit to your work card. I would recommend Netspend to anyone that‚Äôs looking for a better way to access your money fast and safe.,5
fast got my money 2days before everyone‚Ä¶,I cannot transfer my government money for my credit card to this card is too much of a problem I also don't get updates on my balance this would be more helpful to me thank you anyway,5
I give it five stars because your money‚Ä¶,Nice. Help me please get my deposits earlier,5
Never had a problem with my card,cool ig idk :},5
Great üëç,Everything is good,4
Looking forward to getting my first‚Ä¶,The last male customer service representative was slow rude. He had a thick accent yet i continue to speak with him. I was forced to order a new debit card when i actually had done that and received it. I held it in my hand as i was on the call. I asked to speak to a supervisor who took care of the inmate issues,5
Always loved Netspend! #1 prepaid card!,So easy and dependable. Love my card,5
My Experience,Bad damm card,5
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt download,The only thing that I can say is that I really ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èüíØI just can't begin to thank you for being here for me,5
I was very happy with the last help‚Ä¶,I am discouraged by your business model as it relates to fees. To charge $1.50 for every single transaction is offensive and unjustifiable in my opinion. I am aware and understand the need to turn profits but this practice is beyond what I consider reasonable! I am not a lawyer and it is my responsibility to read and understand the terms and conditions but these kinds of business models should be illegal. Just because you can get away with something doesn't mean you should. The card is marketed as a convenience and your market seems to be people who have likely had financial problems in the past so this policy preys on the already weak and takes more from the people who have the least to give up. This is an obscene practice and hopefully it costs the company some day....another reason to hate ythe banking industry! I will make sure i am aggressive with my condemnation of this card whenever I have the chance and will advise people to avoid it at all costs,1
Excellent service,I had someone steal my money and because netspend did not give me my money back I ended up homeless would never suggest anyone using this company after 8 years of having my check deposited they did a old retired woman wrong.,5
I had no idea there was a $1.50 per‚Ä¶,I'm not having any problems with my card.Set up is easy.loading is conveniently located.Everything works. That's all I ask and expect from any company that I do business with.,5
One Word,It charges for every swipe. I only use to get loans on it and never know exactly how much because of the charges.,1
My problem was not solved I still can‚Äôt‚Ä¶,I like the fact that you are convenient and prepaid and accepted everywhere I don't like the fact that you charge a dollar every time I spend a dollar no matter what when or how y'all charge me to spend my own money when y'all clearly say that there are no hidden fees,5
Thank you for your immediate response‚Ä¶,"I was extremely satisfied, and thanks again.",1
Aweful,"Great, dependable, and affordable.",5
Great been very easy to use and no problem with it,Thank now I see everything going on thank you üôÇüôÇüôÇüôÇ,1
I have been a customer for a few years‚Ä¶,"Netspend has awesome digital banking and savings accounts!  Services have never let me down, plus I get my paycheck 2 friggen days early!!",5
Netspend is better than the rest!!,I love how we can transfer money from one account to another.  I struggled with that when we had the Green DOT WalMart debit cards.  The only thing that I wonder is about why you don't and won't have any CHIP cards in the future.  Why is that?,5
I get charges for literally everything‚Ä¶,Netspend is good I love the card its good except they charge 1 everytime you use it,5
NetSpend is a good bank to me,I spoke with 4 representative and each one gave me different information. I was very upset because no one could answer my question. I was given the incorrect information the day before. The company is falling very short of training their employees. They should be knowledgeable about the policies,1
I don't understand why you bill me for‚Ä¶,They are great I lock my card and they overnight me anew card and paid $20.00 to over night it to me and I got the card in 2 days thanks u so much,5
I couldn't ask for better service orca‚Ä¶,Awesome easy setups. I don't like having a charge after Everytime using the card..,3

After putting money on my netspend car‚Ä¶,"Outstanding everything is great except for the mobile check cashing service. I get a lot of checks. I have a mobile detailing service, pressure washing, and window cleaning, as well as house cleaning services. It would be so convenient for you guys to offer mobile check cashing. I was allowed to cash one check that I know went down with no issues whatsoever and then bam, it's taken away. I would really appreciate it if you would fix this situation it would be so convenient and you guys would be making so much more money off of me. You guy's would have a reputatiable walking talking living breathing advertising machine and marketing strategist on your team. I talk to so many people everyday. Please fix my mobile check cashing as part of the awesome service I get from you guys everyday. Thanks again for all your help and support !!! You guys rock !!!",4

I love my Netspend account,I tried to give yall a 5 star rating but from my side only one star was lit up not all 5. I have no complaints against yall.Yall are a excellant company. the best people working there so since I am your boss I give everybody a raise.I would ask that yall would visit the nearest oneness Apostolic church nearest you. all 5 stars light up green when I place the mouse on them but when I move it it goes back to one red. Jesus will most certainly bless you when you go to his house. Some people say I don't have to go to church to find God. Isn't that how you find everyone else don't you have to go to there house to find them? In order to really find God we must all go to his house.,5

An excellent choice,You guys lost the star because I have to pay to load my card every time I feel like it should be free loads. I guess I should have checked that before I bought it right? You also lost a star because of the inconvenience of you guys denying a purchase of mine. You lost another star because of the inconvenience where you guys decline my purchase the inconvenience that caused. I had to call to get the card active again which did not prove to be as easy as you would think. All in all so far it's been a horrible experience and I am currently looking for a different product.,5

Bc I have had to change cards three‚Ä¶,"I was able to receive direct deposit with no issues, and it's a good temporary card if you need one quickly. The biggest issue is that there is a fee for every time I swipe my card.",3
Great  Customer service.,"The only thing that i found was the fact that you can only use your card for a 325.00 withdraw at the ATM, you can make multiple transactions, yes, but you also have to pay 325 for each one. That adds up to quiet a bit, along with every other time the card is swipped.",2
the help was very curtsies and helpful,I can use it easier than any bank card I got,5
I have been using Netspend for many,There was an unwanted charge on my car and NetSpend took care of it right away you guys are great,5

Never really had a situation other then‚Ä¶,I didn't get to do my netspend internet sign up but I called in the phone number and set it up easy,5
Easy to load,But I have one complaint and that is you charge $1.50 for every transaction that is done and I think that is wrong and I don't like it and I might just change to another card if it doesn't stop because that's a lot of money to charge a person that's wanting to use your card! That needs to change! Thank you,5
Amazing!,"NetSpend has been a greatly used prepaid card in my home.They have great  security features, and I love that they are welcomed pretty much everywhere..",5

I have been very satisfied with it.,"What place doesn't charge a fee anymore.. ?They're just not any fee free banks or financial institutions that are 100%fee free . plus most of the time,  especially when given the times we live in, credit card companies have been willing to work with customers.  Netspend is no different. üëåüëç",2
Great customer service,I don't like all the fees I'm being charged for using my cards I remember when you can use it as much as you like without being charged unless you was using the Mac Machine,5
My last experience on 12/31/2021,Easy to activate and great customer service,5
You used to allow over draws of $10?!,"I am mostly pleased with my Netspend account. I am so appreciative with your entity, especially, because my monthly government issued allowance is direct deposited in my account 2 - 3 days prior to its regularly scheduled date. What you are lacking, though, is the ability for your customers to make cash withdrawls at an ATM. You would've earned 5 stars from me if we had the option to do that.Thank you!",3
Great,Makes online payments easy to do. Just not a fan of the extra 1.50 charge per transaction. Make it work because I have to though,3
I‚Äôm very secure and content with my net‚Ä¶,So for my experience with Netspend has been excellent this is my first time having a Netspend card,5
So far so good I can‚Äôt complain,I rate Netspend card a 10 because I always get my benefits early each month.The have friendly staff that helps and answers your questions.,5
Net spend seems pretty solid,"At the moment I don‚Äôt feel I have used it long enough to have one. But in do time ,try me back and I will look forward to writing you one.                               Thank you ,Michael Tanksley",4
HORRIBLE CSR. DUMB PEOPLE HIRING DUMB PEOPLE,"I have had a few problems, not too serious.  I  upgraded my card and one of my automatic payments was not turned over to the new card and I had to reset it.",5

5 Stars,I don't like the 1.50 y'all take off my card every time i use it its my money and y'all stealing it,5
There's to many fees and I can't trust‚Ä¶,I like my All Access Account with Netspend. I never see any cash back rewards or points rewarded to my account. I make plenty of purchases with my card. So I'm not sure why I'm not seeing any rewards AR test points like you say in your advertisement and even in some of your literature and information here that you can get cash back on many purchases. I have yet to see that happen for my account. If there's something I can do different differently so that I could benefit from this please let me know thank you,5
Everything was great no glitches no‚Ä¶,NetSpend is a very good company to work with I have not had any problems with this company so ...so far excellent!,1
NetSpend is great because you get paid‚Ä¶,Good job people,5
Rather the Netspend account is useful‚Ä¶,The Netspend card gives me freedom to go anywhere and purchase the things I need very fast and I like that,5
I have not had any problems what so ever,I got a card just to have to use to put money on for my online buying and then they sent me a personalized card with my name on it. Even it‚Äôs a prepaid card I love it great company.,4
Always can depend on netspend,The one thing I would add to the service on the card is the ability to put some money in a place where it can't be accessed unless you make it accessible.,5
It's greatly,Customer service is excellent. Resolves my problem Everytime. You don't have to stay on hold for long periods of time.,5
Great!!!,Always very useful I am disabled and do not own credit cards but I still get all the benefits of credit cards because I do a lot of online shopping and when the card is out of moneyI have no problem refilling it,4

Good job! Thank you,Very good  service,5
I love your customer service and card‚Ä¶,I thought I had the black card but I got the blue card. It seems like a lot of extra money is being took out when I get some money off my card from an atm,5
I like your services,If there weren't so many fees NetSpend would be perfect,5
The card is very good,Works all time when  you need it unlike banking cards that have problems  all of time,5
I love netspend,Yes I give 4 stars because it will say I have no pending deposit and I know I do because it will be posted the same day,5
So far i really like it.,Good customer service. The app needs some work. Hard to sign in,5
You guys stole me 70 Bucks with your‚Ä¶,Easy to use. Easy to get help from customer service.,5
Bad service,Cuz you claim to have your customers or your account holders in there doing things in their best interest is number one that's what y'all about it's complete liaryou're a liar because if you did you listen when I cause customer or an account holder tells you they're uncomfortable with signing up for something or having a card expedited to him so they'll get it early early because they don't want to start out accounting negative it just wasn't right to them and you insist and as many times I tell you they don't want to you just keep on insisting did they do until they do and then something comes along like they did with me being that I could I need a savings account and I can't set up a savings account because y'all didn't have my best interest number because when I told her I didn't feel comfortable starting an account out in the negative by having a card expedited to me she didn't go settle for that she kept insisting no matter how much I said I didn't want to until I agree and now I can't open the savings account through y'all because I have a negative balance and I need a savings account because I need to have money put up in an account so I'm not walking around with it on me because that money is for important things that have to do with my future and I explain that to y'all I called y'all back and explain it to you try to see if y'all would compromise and take me back to a zero balance one time credit so I can open up this account because I need I need I needed to put it in an account if I savings account and you still wouldn't do it so guess what I found somewhere else ha change the direct deposit that I had options into before I was going because I already had already had it set up to where I was going to receive my March benefits of SSI home my direct express but whenever y'all didn't help me out when I called seeking your help about a savings account and why and that was the reason why I didn't want to start out an account in the hole because hey certain things you can't get if you need them with vet account if you do have a negative balance but y'all didn't care so guess what I done to go to an actual Federal credit Union with my checking in my savings and guess what y'all won't get from me oh oh y'all that $28 or $30 for the rest of my life I don't care screw NetSpend get it like the Red Cross,1
It's an easy way to make purchases‚Ä¶,"This is the best debit card I've ever had, it's easy to load and use, I'm going to recommend it to all my friends      I LOVE IT",1
I made a call to Netspend on 3/19/22‚Ä¶,"Great, easy and fun to use.",5
I went to a ATM machine and withdrawed‚Ä¶,NetSpend has been great. Payments are always on time and I love the text message notification every time I use my card.,1
Poorly NetSpend suck,Great card for direct deposit Just got a Divorce and needed a card quick me and my ex-wife has he is Netspend  for over eight years and we love it probably the only thing that we agreed to like,1

My experience with Netspend have been‚Ä¶,Horrible never again,5
Excellent!!!,A REALLY GOOD CARD BUT I DON'T LIKE THE SWIPE FEES,5
If only they didn't have so many fees.,Excellent!  Timely receipt of card and easy to set up direct deposit and funding.,5
I didn't know I was going to be charged‚Ä¶,Netspend all access debit card account is not really all that great.,4
You charge me everytime I use my card‚Ä¶,It's great and very easy to use!,4
Need to learn system,This card is not good. Everytime I add money to my account it takes hours to show up in my account. There is also a fee everytime you add money to the card as well as a $5 monthly fee just to have the card. Chime is a much better option.,1
NetSpend is an amazing online bank and‚Ä¶,"This service makes me very unhappy. It‚Äôs too much to sign up, I‚Äôm not comfortable with the process, there‚Äôs a fee for everything, & nothing is convenient about it. I‚Äôm most excited about canceling it when I get the chance.",3
Customer service is fantastic,Excellent service,5
Yall are great I love getting my money‚Ä¶,Never had a problem and as easy to set up and I get my money within one to two days when deposited I used other cards and half the time you can't even get a pin set like another card I had,3
Great app.‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê,I think the WILLINGNESS and the ATTITUDE of the person that FIRST uploads your card makes a DIFFERENCE. VERY HELPFUL in my CASE!!,5
I trust NetSpend very much,"I don't understand why I have an overdraft on one account that hasn't been used in over a month when the last month it was active I received a direct deposit to the account,then my direct deposit was put into another account,so as we set I'm overdrawn on 2 account,it to confusing,I called customer service and the lady just kept repeating herself,I asked for a supervisor and was refused I ended up losing my patience and hung up.this account is taking too much in fees,every month it's something new",5
I love using  the netspend account it‚Ä¶,"To many fees.  Some fees are understandable, but paying for transactions....",5
I disputed a claim made for $25.40 to‚Ä¶,Keep charging fees after card was cancelled,5
Very quick n easy app and direct deposit,"I'm very grateful to have Netspend. I was able to activate the card and have my paycheck deposited easily. I love the convenience of having an alert for every time my card is used. I haven't had the account long, but I'm loving the benefits of having it.",1
Terrible don't use it,Would be nice if the deposit limit could be raised so the user wouldn‚Äôt have to pay the deposit fee multiple times .,5
Great love it,I am absolutely happy that i have the NetSpend card it helps me do alot that I need to do without leaving my home.,1
Outstanding thank goodness for‚Ä¶,I've always had really good luck with NetSpend since day one I don't have one complaint I'm very very satisfied with every function that they have to offer I I would highly recommend it to anybody,5
Excellent for you are,Like your service very much. Thanks,5
Thank you,I love it. I don't find anything wrong with it,5
Im very happy with my services thru‚Ä¶,Im able to pay bills and have a direct history of what was paid and send money without any complications.,5
i love my alerts,Underhanded...I would never get this card again after I got the card I had taken and used it at McDonald's Taco Bell Walgreens not only did I do that I also had gone to the boat and did some ATM withdrawals also making sure that I didn't overdraw there was some balance inquiries. After I received my first notice that my statement was ready and I was able to finally download the app and be able to get on after several tries it was brought to my attention. By going over my statement that there were 50 cents for each balance inquiry that I used at the ATM which was not stated at the ATM and any signature purchase such as McDonald's Taco Bell Walgreens Walmart I was charged for. And maybe looking at your declaration or the information that comes with your card I want to know how many people do that normally you know if there are charges people do kind of normal upstanding people tell you. Then when you do get a hold of the company and you tell them how you feel then they want to go ahead and return what you've asked then you go to get it out at Walgreens and then it's charged again for a signature purchase never ever will I ever use this card again.,4
I‚Äôm happy I chose Netspend,Service is good. I don't like the monthly charge plan and I don't care for the pay as you go plan. But I accept it for the convenience and good service.,5
I haven't had Any trouble with my‚Ä¶,"Have been with Netspend for some time now and find it to be very reliable and the security  is safe. I took advantage of getting a second card for sending funds to family and friends with flash ID numbers, works great and fast.",5
Amazing,Great bank would highly recommend,5
Very great thank you.,Cost too much to add money to the card. I will be looking for a cheaper option.,5
I really enjoying the care it is easy‚Ä¶,Bad experience with app and customer service.,5

So,as soon as I get my check‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going back to a normal bank we‚Äôre your treated like a person and not a robot..",5
Wonderful,Customer service rep was extremely helpful. Gave me exactly what I needed to know!,5
Good,"The woman I spoke with was very helpful, however, she said to wait for my tax refund to be deposited BEFORE I activated my new card, and my federal refund was returned. Hoping they send me a check soon, as it was going for rent. I also did call within the timeframe and they STILL sent it back to IRS.",5
I was charged to load the card than was‚Ä¶,I never leave home without it.  Best card on the market.  One thing I wish I could do is take a picture of a check to deposit and they take the fee out of the account.Keep up the good work,5
Great easy to use.,I don't have much to say except the netspend app and sometimes the website seem to be down alot. You guys are working on it seems like every other day and sometimes every day. NetSpend needs to get their ducks in a row.Thats about it have a nice day.,1

Would be nice if we could load money on‚Ä¶,"I gave this review of reference unto the highway robbery of what is called the fees. The fees are just unbelievable for any ATM usage, they are charging the user of the cardholder twice for withdrawing money from the account, it is just absurd and ridiculous to charge so much. I will never recommend your services to anyone. You can keep all of your services because this card is trash.",5
No complaints,Very Useful and you can Trust Netspend Services,4

Always a Great Experience,"I have to say that NetSpend has truly impressed me.  First, they stopped a fraudulent transaction on my card.  I needed the money on my card so they sent me a new one via Federal Express. KUDOS TO NETSPEND!!!  Thank you!",5
My experience,I have dealt with NetSpend for several years now and the problems I've had to deal with and go through with all the questions just to get my own money it's so sad that your system is so poor especially when you are giving the answers to the question they are asking you right they want to say wrong will they should send out a survey and ask the people how the matter should be handle example when did you start this account and you say I'm not sure cause I've been dealing with you all for years wrong answer now back to the beginning that's not good for the customer last three transaction ok if we know that we are going to be asked these things we would really try to remember ok it's sad when we have to go through all the of this just to get our money that has been deposited into our account and despite everything else don't despute a transaction they want to stop your card and when you have direct deposit going to the card now we have issues trying to get access to what's belongs to us and being out on hold with that music and than being hung up on bad business get a better system,5
Customer service experience,I've never had a debit/credit card before. So yea it's pretty good and I would definitely recommend. Being able to make signature/electronic purchases and being able to load the card with cash from various different reload stations very convenient 4‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚úîÔ∏è,5

Netspend,"I am happy with how nice and wonderful it was to use the automated phone activate the card.

Thanks for politeness.Janet",5
Everything is good.,Love Netspend! Money is in my account without lifting a finger with direct deposit. $5.00 fee is less than most checking accounts. Get my monthly benefits at least two days early. The app makes checking on my balance ir account fast and easy....thank you Netspend üòÅ,5
Very reliable service üëå,Great! Trustworthy!,5
Experiencing swapping phones and‚Ä¶,Love it can use it any where just wish it didn't cost so much to reload and you can only reload up to five hundred dollars so if you need more it cost the same price to put more on other then that love it,5
A very secure service to use,Refused to let me spend my money how I wanted because they didn't support the merchant turning into a real socialist republic!!!!!,1
Could be a better setup to getting into‚Ä¶,"You need to switch your cards to a chip card and tap to pay. Also you to associate with plaid for account variations, and raise the Zelle transfer limit to $2000 a week. These are vital things that need to be addressed",5

Could be better.,Seems when my purchases go through and you subtract them from what I have they are never the right amount. I have noticed extra being taken and that‚Äôs not right . For example if I have 86.69 and I purchase 26. 70 well your math would take an extra 1.50 . I‚Äôm not happy over this at all.,5
Charge you 1.50 for every purchase!,Well this is my first time using next flip and so far so good and mean everything went well for me I don't know how to do this but I'm being honest and truthful I recommend you to everyone I know thank you,4

Get rid of fees,You know what..... I can honestly say that this is so far the easiest way I've ever managed my money. The app is self-explanatory and if you can't figure out how to use it then you need a Legal Power of Attorney to handle your life and money.,5

Good üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç,"When not giving handicapped individuals three months of their SSD, do they deserve the humiliation of eviction? Nobody does. It's hard to move so a flipper an renovate with. their  belongings dripping in the rain at the icy street.level..Don't they deserve their bed, a roof, everything they've worked for. People need their pay and you shouldn't have to guess the number of a card you blocked due to fraudulent attempts by other parties. NetSpend can speak life or death with the power of the card.",2
good if you don't mind paying the fees,"To start with, I am a victim of ID theft. For those of you who already know what I've been going through can feel the same pain as I do. And for those of you who have never had the experience, more power plus luck to all of you. My money is as important to me as yours is to you. With that being said, I wish to keep, manage and have full control as to how I choose to spend my own money. Over the past eighteen months, I have had checking accounts with three different banks, while under the impression that my money was safe. Only to come to realize that each bank had full control of my money to manage it, control it and how it was spent. Then, comes NETSPEND and their type of service, or should I say services, to allow me full control of my money, once I knew the rules of operating an account with them.My son-in-law introduced me to NETSPEND. The more that I researched it, the more I could see what a good way to manage my money and also manage my budget at the same time. Now, I'm not a simple minded individual and I realize that NETSPEND is owned and managed by MetaBank. But in doing my daily financial business, I do all my financial dealings through NETSPEND only. One place where I can keep my money safe, check on it 24/7, print out a hard copy of where my money goes and when. They even offer several programs to operate under financially. Plus a number of extra services  to make your financial world much easier to deal with.I'm very glad to have made the choice to go with NETSPEND and I think if you spent a little research time on them and you also decide to open an account with them for your financial needs. You to could experience the same comfortable feelings that I have about my hard earned cash and it's safety.",5
I love netspend,"I started a new job this month and use my NetSpend card for my weekly paycheck to be automatically deposited to. I have been thrilled with the choice!! The website is incredibly informative and the one time I called the Customer Service line, the Agent was an absolute dream!! She accessed my account and quickly answered my question. She LISTENED to me and it felt great to hang up feeling better, not worse.",4
You charge $1.50 every time the card is‚Ä¶,You due a wonderful job helping me when I have a problem. but I thnk your overdraft fees are to high. and you shouldn't charge atm fees since there isn'tany banks that are connected to meta bank.,5
My experience has been positive.,Too many fees associated with using the debit card,1
Netspend is ok,"You charge for everything like some greedy billion dollar corporation.  You ucking charge people money for checking an empty balance.  Its not bad enough people have no money,  but you charge a broke motherfluker. It 5 bucks per cash withdrawal and a monthly fee on top of being charged a fee for anything bought.  You are another bunch of losers.",5
Charged $1.50 every time I used this‚Ä¶,I have thoroughly enjoyed using my Netspend Card. It has been very convenient to use.  I have not had any issues.  I highly recommend obtaining the card for special use.  Thank You.,5
I gave you five stars isn't that enough‚Ä¶,Easy access app. Very helpful when you have a question or suspect fraudulent usage.,1

Really like using my NetSpend card but‚Ä¶,"NetSpend blocked my card as soon as there was a charge on it that wasn't consistent with my normal spending. I was so grateful. Most banks don't even do that. I have had an excellent experience with NetSpend and will continue to get my money deposited in their bank. Also, when I had my money direct deposited, I received a new card with more amenities.",1
I would like NetSpend better if I could‚Ä¶,It's good but won't let me link to my cash app,4
I keep having people try and scan me,So much better than Green dot who kept making my card invalid 3 paydays in a row,4
Good for doing ACH deposit,"It's cool I mean it might not be 5 dollars a month cool, but I'm liking it so far.",3
Other than too many fees this card is‚Ä¶,I love how I get a text everytime I use my card,5
I love the fact that you can get‚Ä¶,I got my funds loaded to my card promptly and getting my funds was much easier this time with my name on the card.,3
I have had the same password and now it‚Ä¶,It's a great just some issues of take $1-$5 each time of use Witch is a problem for me cause no money should be tookin out or charged for any every purchase.,5
One word family,Net spend is so easy to load money and receive direct deposit for checks! Couldn't ask for a better bank and card L,3
No good,I like this card and how it sends me a reminder of what is spent and how much o have . Thats a good thing for some of us thats busy,5
Good,My anytime alerts aren't  working have to keep calling to know my balance!,3
Great Card,"I just updated my employer with my account info on Tuesday. I assumed it wouldn‚Äôt work until next pay period. Than I got a text that it was in my account.

I love NetSpend,I love Netspend the only problem I have is it says you will receive your pay check 2 days early and I haven't recieved mine 2 days early yet. I get my check the same day as pay day. But other then that Netspend is great.,5
What more can y'all,It's ok.did have call about why I was charged every time I used my card it was fixed when I called,5
I love it,"Originally trying to hook up suckedtrying to speak to a live person really sucked.overall, your total package was not worth $5.00/month.I am forced to accept your terms and conditions which double sucks this part eats the big dork.

Because I never even applied for one‚Ä¶,I updated my account to all access so I would be able to over draft but I still can't my deposit is on different days each month so I never know when I am going to receive my check and I don't receive updates on my account but I do on somebody else,5
Excellent thanks,Sometime they wouldn't let me get my money on the card that that I lost and I asked is there any other way I could get it they tell me no there's no other way so I'm very not too happy with the company I just wish they could help me better than what they can,1

NetSpend charge too much for transaction,My card was hacked and I've put minimal use on it,1
So far I'm very happy with Net Spend‚Ä¶,"My card number was used fraudulently as soon as I activated it.  I reported the 3 transactions that depleted my card on 12/27/2021 and to date, there is still no resolution.  I reported it properly on multiple occasions and get the run around. I received this Netspend card as a gift from my Dad and have not been able to use it as my $300.00 was taken out of my card as someone fraudulently paid utility bills in 2 different states where I do not live or have an account with. They both told me that they could not help me for ""security"" reasons. Imagine that? I will never use Netspend as you do not support your customers when fraud takes place on your cards.",4
My service has been very good,Been using Netspend for years definitely reliable and better then most.,5

The only problem I had is with the app‚Ä¶,I used my card online to make a purchase. That was the easy part. However i guess a third party got my information and tried to charge me. Netspend sent me a text asking if i made the charge i replied no and they immediately shut the card off and sent me a new one. this experience is the whole reason i do not use my credit card or bank card online. i choose Netspend that way i can place the money i need on there to make the online purchases that i intend with out worrying about my credit or bank account. I'm really impressed that they caught the attempted fraud immediately.,2

The best card I have ever had I haven't had any trouble out of here for being online and that is unusual I will stick to NetSpend thank you NetSpend,"Regarding overdraft protection, there should be a set amount.  I was at Walmart the other day and it was extremely embarrassing to have to keep taking items off and re-swiping my card until it approved the amount.",5

Great card,Good product.  I would to see a more expanded one-on-one instruction and installation of Netspend.,5
You all canceled my card for no reason‚Ä¶,Customer service is a joke. They don't help you and don't answer your questions. Ive had money sent back twice to my bank because the name doesn't match but the account numbers do. That is the most ridiculous shi* I ever heard. The guy I talked to the 2nd time was rude the first gal I talked to hung up on me,4
When you send alerts,"I enjoy Netspend cause I don't like to use banks, and this way it is much easier to get my direct deposit and to pay my bills anywhere I go.",2
Netspend locked my account,"5 stars, it‚Äôs great",1
Love NetSpend,They keep me informed on every action taking place on my account within seconds.,1
Excellent,I love using my netspend card. It never failed me always there when I needed it.,5

Decent card,Love the texts that come when a purchase is made. So easy to keep up with my balance!!,5
Because you keep me updated what's‚Ä¶,I'm a very satisfied customer and always will be thank you üòä,4
NetSpend is a reliable and efficient‚Ä¶,It's a inconvenience to withdraw money from ATMs and then they overcharge,5
Thank you,I don't like that I can't transfer my money from this card to my actual bank account especially when I'm in great need to do so cuz of a abusive relationship,5
I like this pain because you get‚Ä¶,I've been a customer for over five years now.,5
I think you guys did a great job!!,I don‚Äôt like that I‚Äôm being changed to use my own money!!,4
üëã You guys,"I love NetSpend .. Money alway's comes early ,no hastle's no complaint's ...",5
Great,Took longer than 5 days to transfer money from one card to the next. No one put in the request for that transfer and I had to keep calling in everyday for people to do their job.,5
"I have had great experience, BUT",Easy to use.u can use any visa except.,5
Always good customer service,Great job y'all are amazing,3
Y'all r doing good,I am very happy and content with Netspend. I use Netspenf to pay bills. I have less problems than when I use my in town bank.I will always use Netspend for online purchases as well.,5
I have had nothing but really positive‚Ä¶,I just want to say I'm very proud of Netspend they have exactly what I expected in them. My money comes on the exact day they said its going to take place. They are very respectful  when you have a problem toward answering questions about your fund's.,4
Excellent love that we're able to go to‚Ä¶,I don't like that it charges me every single time I use it! Is there an overdraft fee if I didn't have the money?,5
Do not use Netspend!,I had a unknown charge made to my account and while being under review I have no access to utilizing expected deposits being made to my account in time to pay my rent. This puts me at risk with my living situation. I am also now at a negative balance with an added fee during this process. The fact that I will not be able to access my funds for 7-10 business days is ridiculous.,5
I give NetSpend five stars because‚Ä¶,It's helpful it helps me by not using my cash in places and it helps to by on line,1
So far my experience has been great!,I like having a 2nd card that I can pay with.,5
I love my Netspend card easily save‚Ä¶,"I like the fact that I can budget my money so easily with Netspend. Coupled with the security of online purchasing, it‚Äôs a great app.",4
I didn‚Äôt Expect to pay 1.50$every time‚Ä¶,NetSpend is the best,5
I borrowed $75 from a good friend,"Amazing, I love my Netspend card love it",3
I want to transfer my funds into my‚Ä¶,Updated your automatic phone line. They won't let you transfer money from one account to another.,1
Great card,Never get a Netspend card!!!!  They are scammers. They will block you from your own money for no reason at all. You can provide proof of address valid id and ssc and they still keep your account blocked. Literally a joke please save your time and hard earned money. NEVER AGAINNNN.,1
I've used netspend on and off over the‚Ä¶,Love the ability to deposit checks in my living room! Very very cool! The ability to pay online and NOT use my card number is beyond valuable! Never again will someone steal all my money!,5
Thanks I pay my bills üíØ and do so much‚Ä¶,"The overdraft fee is too much, when other cards do not have an overdraft fee",5
A good debit card and a lot of perks,I never had a problem with netspend good bank,5
I love Netspend ‚ù§Ô∏è No issues what so‚Ä¶,I'm not happy I can't cash my payroll check on my mobile device. It was very convenient cashing my checks. Now I'm contemplating closing my NetSpend account. Restate my prilvage please..,5
Enjoy it,I tried to do a Netspend to Netspend transfer and it wouldn‚Äôt let me,5
Good service,"Their VISA debit cards work great.  I was able to easily load and reload funds onto my account without error.  Use of the card works very well also, and I truly like the fact that Netspend has real-time up-to-date transactional history as it happens.  Their security features associated with every Netspend card, in addition to their very customer oriented-friendly staff of service representatives gives me peace of mind knowing that my money and account data is safe with them.  I'm very pleased with opening up an account with Netspend/MetaBank.",5
How did we do,I am  trying to get  overdraft on my all access  card that I  receive  my SSI  deposit  on,5
Fees are outrageous,quite accurate very achievable when needed for use.,5
So far they have been a good company to‚Ä¶,You took 15$ from me when you shouldn‚Äôt have I‚Äôll never use Netspend again,1
I have to say i hate the monthly fee‚Ä¶,Great job. I receive my direct deposits 2 days early and I love the over draft protection,5
I can‚Äôt ask for more,"I had to get a second card because I was h able to register the first one. Netspend would benefit from allowing customers to load the card from PayPal, Zelle and Cashapp. Plaid asks for bank log in and password and there is no way I‚Äôm divulging that information. Too many fees associated with this card and the load locations don‚Äôt necessarily have staff members who know how to load the card. It‚Äôs been a headache.",2
Great way to receive deposit,Im supposed to get 1 atm withdrawal free but i dont and the mobile check load is a joke,5
Great card,Netspend is the best .I have never had a problem obtaining my funds or getting any of my banking info. I would recommend this to anyone.,5
I was looking for an alternative to my‚Ä¶,"Had problems last card, but NetSpend came though for me ü§óü§óü§óü§ó",5
It's a good card..,Never had an issue. That‚Äôs great. Always supportive and polite.,5
go netspend,"From a simple gas station/grocery store purchase to an online purchase, you're charged a fee. I will change to a different card provider as soon as possible.",4
So far it's been great thanks,No other card like it! Been a member for 6+ years.,5
My card was mis-placed  need to cancel‚Ä¶,Easy to use. I can load money anytime i need to. I Love it!,5
Great card services love the card,Great service,1
Best,"You contacted me to ensure that I was making a purchase. I appreciate that. I recently had my identity stolen. Someone used my account and took my money. This bank did not recognize the suspicious behavior and allowed it.$28,000 plus was lost!!!",5
Never had any issues with deposits or‚Ä¶,Good when ya need it in emergency or short on time  convenient to use anytime!,5
for a good play time,"wont allow me to transfer all my money from a closed netspend account to my new account and caed, then charge me a transfer fee to transfer my own money within their system, i could see transfering to another company, but this is a in house transfer and they stll wont let me transfer all my money so they can charge me again ! this sucks when i do get all of my money im leaving netspend for chime !",5
Awesome,"Very unhappy with useless customer service. It is not the fault of the agent. It is the fault of the computer program. After 15 years of banking with Meta, you are losing me due to incompetent computer programs.",5
You're doing excellent every time you‚Ä¶,Great appHas hand on saving account  an excellent  costumer  service..,5
Netspend is a great card I get my‚Ä¶,Everyone in the world  should have netspend,5

It‚Äôs good,I love that I can get my direct deposit early but it's taking so long for me to get my new upgraded card in the mail,5
Quality quality,I don't like the fact that they charge for every single transaction when you use your card.,5
Good service.,Was easy to re activate and get back on track.,3
Very satisfied with NetSpend.,You make it so easy to sign up and activate my card so thank you,5
Excellent,Quick payday. Sooner than everyone else at work. üòä thanks,5
NetSpend kept me from losing my money,"I signed up for overdraft protection (Yes) I over drafted my account but I have recurring payments from 2 jobs as soon as y‚Äôall got your payment you stopped me from being able to use All access! That‚Äôs why I got this account, so now I‚Äôm looking for a new bank YALL suck",5
Great job I love it,so far so good....although convertng from the rack card to permanent embossed card took a little bit of guesswork...it was not explained well in the package I bought and loaded at Walmart....That took alot of calls to your company to realize how to make the conversion.DeDon Ramsdenar is not my real name....where did that come from?,4
U love net spend y‚Äôall the best,For sure for sure what,5
Charges every time I use my card,"I like netspend, and I appreciate the fraud alerts, But I believe there sure be more time to call netspend and review the situation,  before you cut off the card, I have been through a lot of drama due to netspend just cutting off the card",5
Love it,Sometimes when I'm talking to a customer service representative I can't hardly understand them like they're foreign language sometimes get in the way but they assist me and I'm very pleased with NetSpend,1
I was looking for a card without such‚Ä¶,First of all you‚Äôve got representatives that can‚Äôt speak English. And when you‚Äôre dealing with people that are hard to hear in Midland virtually impossible to understand what‚Äôs going on. Change that policy right now you‚Äôre losing me real quick. I‚Äôm getting deposit notices on my phone but when I go to look at my account online the deposits not there you really messed up my account I don‚Äôt know where I stand anymoreNo I‚Äôm not happy and I would not recommend you,5
Simply great service overall,I enjoy using NetSpend card.i can always rely on them.,5
And you don't deserve that,I've been banking with NetSpend for years and only recently did I have a problem and that is because my account was expiring for which I opened another which was an upgrade. So it's no wonder why there was a little mix up at first.,5
Ordered my card came in mail loaded it‚Ä¶,Very easy to load after u know what stores to go wish they didn't have a loaded fee put besides that pretty good over all,1
Awesome company thanks to your staff....,I was very thankful for y'all for helping me out,5
Great customer service,The payment is 2 days for your pay check so would that be on Wednesday instead of Thursday?,5
Great wonderful,I called you guys to stop payment of 345.00$ from coming out of my account. Now you all tell me I have to wait until March to get my money back.,5

I love it I give it 5 stars,I GOT HELP WITH MY ACCOUNT THAT I NEVER ASKED TO BE BLOCKED;MISS;;LOVELY HELPED ME GETMY NEW CARD AND GET MY ACCOUNT OPEN,5
Wish Netspend had Zelle,Netspend was recommended to me by a friend and has been a very positive banking experience and when they rid themselves of ridiculous transaction fees could I possibly give them 5 stars. They have a lot of tough competition out there that never charge a transaction fee.,5
Been here for years cnt even over draft‚Ä¶,Got the card down to where I don't care about losing a dollar something I will not be using this card again,4
I have been a customer of netspend for‚Ä¶,"Navigating to the referral platform or accessing a referral code is pretty nonexistent.  I've been trying for days to refer friends, but no luck gaining the referral form/code online.  The entire process lacks streamlining.  When I reached out to customer service, their response was to refer through the referral page online.  Yea that's a no brainer, only issue is, IT DOESN'T EXIST!",3
NetSpend has done everything that it‚Ä¶,I don‚Äôt ever get notifications when check deposit .. and it takes a while to load,5
it's good,Netspend is very good and easy to use thank you,5
The Best One Yet,Excellent service. Customer service was extremely kind and patient when I didn't understand some things.,5
Every time I've spoken with anyone they‚Ä¶,I really like this card its fast & simpleNo hassle easy to loadNo problem at all,5
Thank you so much for making it so,Just starting to use it. Fees are to high.,5
Great,"I've been with Netspend for year's and wouldn't change to any other card, they've refunded my disputed transactions over and over again.",5
NetSpend all access account is legit‚Ä¶,There are some important things such as money wire transfers that should be allowed. Which is a total bummer really no use to having it just get a Walmart money card and be btter off,5
I don't know why it's so much to‚Ä¶,Money come out my account without my permission,3
Horrible ass people they canceled my‚Ä¶,Love my card and it's perks. Works just as if I had a bank,1
Transferring funds from your bank‚Ä¶,It‚Äôs a good card to have. But I don‚Äôt like to pay twice to use the card. Fix that.,1
The only thing I don't care for is‚Ä¶,"Hi , the truth of the matter is ,at first I was uncertain about your card. But , l have come to the conclusion that you are just as good as a back and or credit union . And l will continue to and all my deposit to you Thank You",3
I have used Netspend for years and it‚Ä¶,Very comfortable in there work to help people.,3
‚Ä¶expensive!!,Service reactivated smoothly and effectively. All needed steps were explained clearly and concisely.  No problems.,5
The fees are confusing,Cant speak to agent to even access my account or reset my password,1
Love netspend,So far Netspend has been incredible. I haven‚Äôt had any major issues yet and when calling customer service there was not a long hold.,3
Love this app,Netspend is the best prepaid card out there.Easy to load and even more convenient to use no hidden fees,5
It‚Äôs ok,"I enjoy netspend an using it has been great, but if we could get a few overdraft details working it would be nice.",5
My funds were stolen was told to put in‚Ä¶,Very happy with service always professional and nice,4
5 star,"This card is great. However, I do wish there were fewer fee's. Other than that, my experience with NetSpend has been a great experience.",1
a most excellent card,Explain how to use the mobile check load better so that people wouldn't receive emails that they're checks don't go through.,5
Need my money,Love it!!!! Wish I could give it 6 stars,5
Best I've ever had,"I've been a Netspend Customer for a long time. I recently tried to use the overdraft protection that I've had for five years and discovered that it no longer exists. I called customer service and was told I didn't know what I was talking about, that Netspend never had overdraft protection.In the past I felt that Netspend was a cut above other prepaid cards. I don't feel that way now. The customer service agents used to be top notch. Now the level of custom service they give is deplorable. They don't even understand the issue.",3
Yes I like it and it easy to‚Ä¶,B that ve super dope my niggia i want it babby boyy were u at,5
Card holder,No customer care. They just shuffle you back to the recording and don't resolve anything.,5
Very helpful I get paid earlier than most.,Great jvnvuvivivivo,5
So far so good,I am very upset at your procedures on giving my money back. Which I put into these cards with cash and now you making me go thru all this red tape to be reimbursed or refunded my money. This is bull poop!!,5

I will give 4 stars because  I don't‚Ä¶,Do a good job I'm very grateful because every time I order I never have trouble with everything thank you,5
I would like to thank you all for doing‚Ä¶,Before Christmas I had 3 charges on my net spend account. I disputed they would not pay it back which that is fine. Then I went and filed my taxes and got a rapid refund. So Monday morning I tried to use my card and it declined I call them to see why and they said because we closed your account we will send you the money in check form in 7-10 business days. Due to because I disputed last year. They decided to close the account. My work checks are deposited in that card as well. I had to hear it from someone who don't speak very good English. They are very rude and told me it was not there problem. I will never use them nor recommend them.,4
I have only been getting half of my‚Ä¶,Good card for what I need it for,5
NetSpend is next best thing to have if‚Ä¶,Great awesomeness job y‚Äôall are great at what you do please keep up the great work.  You guys got great people and you guys have awesome service and great team work,3
I enjoy the netspend for years,I've had a few problems with using your app or card at 95% of the retailers` I've been using. Some don't take your payments which has made it a bit difficult for me.,5
I Love it,Easy to use and just simple I liken it all around nothing bad to say,5
Great üòäüòä,Spell having 360 Norton I really didn't see any raisin that I would have to worry in the first half of my credit card use but it looks like I really did delete your search history that might help but I didn't about cookies and other stuff that may be bad for your email address I can only think of a few ways that they could have got in. But having Norton 360 they're very courteous I'm explaining to me that it was nobody's fault but mine I just didn't know ignorance is no excuse I will not believing this kind of information on my phone ouch,5
I can‚Äôt even cash my tax check I‚Äôm very‚Ä¶,Had a charge made to my card yall were supposed to fix but nothing was done want be using netspend any more,5
I JUST WSH that the amount of money was‚Ä¶,Its great and it's my favorite card,1
Netspend doing good,what a waste everything about this card was reduculas they put a freeze on my card because they thought there was fraud when i was just trying to purchase some things online the whole thing was just a joke,4
I'm very happy with NetSpend cause it‚Ä¶,I don't like that I get charged$1.50 per transaction on top of the$10 monthly service fee.,5
Because you have too many hidden fees,Yes I have all my problems,5
It's easy to load and available within‚Ä¶,Great service's i just hte you have to pay to check you blance and sone of the other fees shouldnt appy,1
Your service is very user friendly and‚Ä¶,"Fantastic, great card and great service",5
I'm just getting started with NetSpend.,Great on fast card delivery but need work on the netspend portal apps or online because I actually activated the card and the activation still on there  had repeated the same issue with the last 3 of back card and the pin number multiple times,5
I love that when I am purchasing‚Ä¶,I have waited patiently for my money back on a order .I haven't hear anything not 1 email novtxt no call nothing it's been going on over 3 months now.I unfortunately ordered some shoes from a fake website.called FEBRUN.It look so liget but was as fake as they come.regardless I ordered them .then I realized they did not give me a tracking number n I could not reach their company no matter what I done.so I canceled my order I have all of the emails showing my order the confirmation order number the card I used I mean I have everything and I sent it all to NetSpend where an employee from NetSpend told me to send all my info to.and I still 3 months later have not heard a word nothing from ANYONE.The total on my order was $191.00. That amount is nothing to some people but to myself a single mother of 3 that a good amount of money that I worked very hard for.It would be nice to get my money back.please and thank .,4

It‚Äôs Great,Thank you for allowing me to reload a card finally after I oull the money off of it and then realize that u need more on it.,4
It's the best I ever known,Neve had a bad experience really always have done right by me as a customer thanks,5
Best terms I could find,"I  WANT TO KNOW, WHY I AM GETTING CHARGE FEES FOR EVERY TRANSACTIONS I MAKE. HOW CAN I MAKE PAYMENTS TO OTHER CREDITORS?",5
I feel that Netspend should be like the‚Ä¶,"This is one of the earliest cards to use. Just load it and go. It‚Äôs great for those people who don‚Äôt want to worry about using their other cards to pay for things, like reoccurring bills. It‚Äôs do easy to use.",5
Very satisfied,Nice being able to cash a check with the app,3
Works really well great to have,"Awesome, easy to use and get approved.",5
Love Netspend,Grateful for the opportunity to rebuild my credit and have my paycheck sent to direct deposit. All of this has made so much difference during these financially difficult times.,5
I did not ask for this card,Your card is horrible,5
GREAT handling my benefits,Netspend is great I love it because it shows immediately on my phone what was purchase and from where an remaining balances and that is awesome keep up the good work.!!,1
Wonderful and easy to use banking‚Ä¶,Things could be improved. It shouldn‚Äôt take more then a day to get a response back. I‚Äôm not a fan of the $1.50 fee per transaction.It doesn‚Äôt show that right away. It takes more then 2 for it to show up on the app. There was nothing in the terms and conditions about that. I thought I would get fined if I didn‚Äôt use my card every month or so. I do LOVE how I can reload my card at my local DG. Wish I could do the same at my Edmond Walmart.,5
You charge for every transaction and‚Ä¶,"Next to impossible to receive funds from individuals///cash, debit cards, credit card, Bitcoin, Bank to bank, etc",5
It's  easy to add money and I like that‚Ä¶,Netspend has been awesome for me. A definite life savior for me without a bank account. Thanks netspend keep up the great work,3
I luv NetSpend so much thank u,"I've enjoyed it ,mostly there have been some bumps, they cancelled my card.well said I did ,but I was trying to block a transaction for wrong amount,next thing I know my card is void,my money is on that account,so a few calls,s trip to ATM,and me wasting $20.00 ,I could use my old card. Really other than that,no too bad.",5
Great card just wish we had more‚Ä¶,Easy to use and awesome check depositing option!,5
The card sucks because you guys charge‚Ä¶,"So you can't just deposit checks into this account it goes some other out fit which I've never dealt with and put of the blue they told me they'revoked my offer, I thought it spend would be a good idea, but now I've not going to use them at all",5
This card is very good and I like it a‚Ä¶,I'm trying to figure out why you guys took $20 off my card for no reason and there's no explanation you never did this before,1
Awesome,We use Netspend to buy online to avoid using our bank debit card. It works very well for us.,5
They where not able to provide me with‚Ä¶,Great and awesome,5
Making it more easier for the funds to‚Ä¶,Thanks great company and direct deposit is awesome,1
Can't pull up account on app,Great card  to have whiteout ANY TROUBLE EITHER SO THEY'RE VERY MUCH DESERVING OF 5 STARS PLUS 2 THUMBS UP,3
NetSpend is Awesome,Every time I want to use my card Netspend charges me $1.50 for every transaction!,3
Great experience,I‚Äôm very upset with all of the fees I had to pay just to use a prepaid debit card on top of there being another option for a monthly fee for a prepaid card.,5
Netspend is #1,Super easy & hassle free to use & reload money onto the card. Probably the best prepaid card I've ever had.,5
I think it's really neat how I get‚Ä¶,Yes Have a problem with checking my information on your online account board can't get into it also your call in line when prompted for checking your transactions cannot hear them because it skips over that and goes straight to information on loading your card and all this other information it needs to be fixed. Other than that I haven't had any other issues or complaints please fix it and I will gladly review again later if you send me another review rating to let you know how everything's going,5
Take too much of my money when I go to withdraw can't withdraw what I want and plus I can't check my check stubs I don't know what's going on,I really appreciate the extra measures in security Netspend takes to protect their card holders personal information. i have only good things to say about my experience so far.,5
Love it,Charge is for money put in and money spent.  Large purchases might be great but I only make small purchases. Furthermore there are several other companies that offer cards with out a charge at all so......   I am planning to cancel soon. Good luck on your business.,1
ùïΩùñéùñåùñçùñô ùñàùñçùñîùñéùñàùñä,I like Netspend cause of the western union helps,5
Easy and convenient,I love the fact that NetSpend tells me how much I have left on my card. You guys rock,5
Good job,They been great,5
I just don't like the 1.50 everytime I‚Ä¶,so far i am quite satisfied all except the 1.50 you all charge on every transaction. but i do hope to be getting some checks soon. that is all i have to say good day.,5
Awesome,"I've used Netspend in the past, and was very happy with them. Decided to go back.",3
Good service and it works wiw,"here is my only issue: You are asking me to give my opinion, but my opinion involves offensive words because in this situation to get my opinion voiced, with my voice,  i cant thinks of a better way to trully express myself.  so in reality this is just a watered down version of what i really want to say. the good things about netspend are many: good customer service, widespread participation from retailers, good way to have direct deposit, so on and so on.  The only bad thing is how long it took me to find where to reload my card, you guys don't have an efficient quick way to get that info to a new customer and if you do i couldnt find it . Overall netspend is great and i love having my card and account.  .  thankyou netspend.  p.s.  my spelling needs improvement, sorry",5
Great customer service,Well currently I am fighting a dispute with NetSpend and the timeline that y'all give for your provisional credit is 10 days which is a little bit extreme because people have bills things that they need to do with the money that was taken from them for an authorized charges and it seems like it's so time-consuming for NetSpend to put the phones back into a consumers account other than that I have no other problem with NetSpend I appreciate them and all the benefits they offer me I just wish they would have a better NetSpend I just wish that they had a shorter time period when consumers are trying to fight disputes with unauthorized charges!!,5
They are the best never a problem.,I'm satisfied with the all access debit card. I would like to be able to withdraw more money out of account from mac machine. Up the daily limit.,5
I was with you all for 7 years,I used the card once and knew I had 13$ left I decided to get a coffee the other day and was denied because you charged me $5.95 a month to not use my card plus charged me for using the card. I had to dig change to pay for my coffee. As soon as I find another option you are gone.,5
Stars,I can't seem to get a customer service rep when I have a problem,4
Would be better IF....,Nothing is as people in the easiest to two much money,5
Net spend is great and it's very safe,Good card Can't wait til I'm able to get rewards on it,5
Very good,Helpful Easy to make a decision customer service is very prompt knowledgeable,5
There should be no loading fee,I was using this card because I closed my checking account. I made a purchase at a hotel and was owed a refund and 3 WEEKS LATER I still haven't received it. This doesn't happen work other debit or credit cards. I'm very dissatisfied and would not recommend Netspend.,5
5/5 Excellent,Customer service is outstanding and very professional! I had some transactions pending and a customer servuce rep researched the transaction and gave me detailed information and answered all my questions and concerns. Thx Netspend Great Job!,2
Love it,Wish I could have came across net spend several years ago Everything that I want to know or transfer money to another account just by clicking on.,5

I did not get good or bad on this email‚Ä¶,"Hello I'm sorry for the confusion about my address an not received my card. But as I called again you guies worked an took the time to get my address correct an find me so that I can be a customer of NetSpend.  Thank you, Carleen",5
I like netspend,"Your customer service department has fantastic people who are always so helpful. However,  lately they seem unaware of your phone system prompts so when they ""send you back to the system"" and recommend I push this or that, this or that isn't an option. I've called several times and feel as if your customer service team doesn't know the prompt options or the direction they take your callers. I have had a debit card with Netspend for over 5 years and had always been 100% satisfied until this recent frustration.",5
I really do like you service I would‚Ä¶,Only thing I have problem with is having a limit on how much you can transfer to someone and I switched my card to the NetSpend all access card and still had that problem,5
Good,Great job. Would definitely recommend to many of my friends,5
Deposits and communication,"Very easy to load, no high fees. Best prepaid card ever..",5
Amazing,Too many added fees for using the card to make purchases ( a one dollar purchase having a one dollar and fifty cent service fee is ridiculous !!!! )Netspend can make money without overcharging their customers.It‚Äôs not a good look for your company.,4
Y'all are best and everytime I have a‚Ä¶,I'm happy that my paycheck gets posted two days early.  The overdraft is questionable. But all in all I like the card,5

The best,Netspend is there when nobody else will give you a card. They are secure and on point with there security. Netspend has offers that help you out alot to get free things. They help with auto pay and it's actually pretty good to have some money on a netspend account.,5

I like the service from this card‚Ä¶,"This is my second card ,it‚Äôs easy to load 2.95 not bad So far So good",5
Nice,"Your Customer Service Representatives say and do just what they feel like doing. I have had Representatives help me in the most professional, helpful manner. Only to turn around and try n resolve the same nature of circumstance to only tell me it can't be done when a representative 15 minutes prior did it. I've been with NetSpend for years. Your representatives misinformation customers cause major stress at will. Why is this? It's is crazy.",5
NetSpend robbed me of $21.00,"I get direct deposit an I don't get paid early, at fee's ade to high.",5

Always available and helpful beyond compare...,Yes I understand about having security questions but you guys go a little too far you guys wanted me to remember a road what was across the street from my road so why would I know the name of the road what was across the street from my road when I lived in West Barnstable but anyways it doesn't matter I think you bring it a little too far and that's why I give you three stars. And it's kind of bad I know it's covid and everything going on but we're a year past covid now and you still don't have anybody answering the phones for you guys and I think that's pretty pitiful.,4
Netspend is everything it promised,I would have never bought this card if I would have known I had to pay $9.95 for it month $1.50 for every time I use it $350 to load money onto the card and $1.50 for every use where is that a bargain and then you want to charge when I spend it when I use it on jpay you want to charge me $3 and something extra for using the JPay you let somebody else use my card on Google pay and I don't use Google pay and I took my money every time they take my money and you let them continuously take it after I keep calling and calling NetSpend Facebook Google everybody my husband and I are tired of letting you guys get away with our money if we don't know the password pen or something you guys want to keep it you guys want it what do you do with our money I want to know exactly what do you do with our money if we don't have the exact appropriate information because if you say you send it back to the people you're a liar because I've used my address so many times and you're not you you've not sent me my money back so I need you guys to tell me what is going on here where does the money go if it's if I can't get my money off my card no more and you guys lock it where's my money where does my money go does it go in your pocket do you throw it up in the air like Christians do and swear to God whatever comes down belongs to them and God gets his you need to fix your problem people you really need to find the problem and I have a lot of people that's already cutting out on you guys they believe the same thing I believe don't want too too much too much and you can only put $20 or more what if my daughter and he has 10 dollars and she wants to put on the card to give to somebody that's ridiculous ridiculous our hard hard-earned money is going to you guys for no reason because my daughter or somebody forget their password or their pen or something that's bull so you don't need to fix the problem because I'm calling in the next few days I'm giving you my information and I want all of my money reimbursed my husband wants his reimbursed this is ridiculous there's no sense in this every time we turn around add more add more add more and then they want to charge every time you add money that month every time you add money they charge you why do they charge to add the money shouldn't act and you charge to take off the money yet take off the card to use the card to ATMs anything that's just ridiculous best case I'll just go back to Green Dot thank you for your time please send me an email or message my account and let me know exactly what's going on with my information Corey Lee Roberts and Billy Tucker Roberts before I got married it was belly Tucker thank you and I know I'm never here from you guys already I already know this never do and reimburse us millions and millions of people that you go gotten taken for from all that just information that we don't have y'all should be reimbursing us everybody that has a name on that card on a card to get reimbursed from you guys everybody there's no sense in this you guys are worse than the IRS or the government or anything else you guys are worse than that I would never ever have my money direct deposited on this card ever and I have thought about it but I never will until you guys improve better no I will not going to sorry about that do something about your stuff your cards are not worth it,5

I love it,I dislike how you guys charge me an overdraft fee right after doing an overdraft. Normal banks wait until you get a deposit then charge. If this is not fixed i will be taking my money else where! üò†,5
Good service and easy to use ..,I have been with netspend for years and you would think that they would raise the overage amount and the daily withdrawal amount. And you would think that NETSPEND would ask me to be in one of its commercial. Lol,5
Great for me.,"First reply from Netspend...100% incorrect information. Second reply from Netspend...it was obvious by the answer that the agent did not grasp the question because the reply didn't even reflect the subject matter of my question. In conclusion, two Netspend replies by two different agents to the same question and neither answer was accurate. The 2nd reply was so inaccurate that it was nonsensical. Horrible, horrible, horrible customer service. Must be hiring whomever they can find because their answers reflected the fact that they have no understanding of the various Netspend services.",5
Amazing and easy services.,Easy to get an account and good customer service,5
Very courteous and Respectful and‚Ä¶,"It's pretty simple you go to almost any retailer load any amount of money up to 10,000 dollars. Pay a very small fee, and that's it your ready to shop. The best part is that you know when and where your card is being used.",5
I love NetSpend.,Awesome for what I needed it for thanks again,5

Great Customer Service,Can't get ahold of anyone when my card gets charged for things I haven't bought,5
It took me a while to receive my card‚Ä¶,I'm happy with the service and benefits of the card. Thanks!,5
very happy with how convenient‚Ä¶,"This company engages in fraudulent activities such as gouging accounts for no particular reason using microcharges, identity theft, and any means possible of charging accounts. Netspend makes sure to gouge customers in states that don't have adequate consumer protection laws in place by charging bogus fees such as ""inactivity fees"".This service does not have clients, rather victims. Their site security is also lower than it should be (B grade SSL rating).Netspend was sued by the Federal Trade Commission in 2016 for hindering customer's access to their money and though this suit was settled, there are still many outstanding cases of failure to allow users access to their money, processing refunds, etc.Apparently they are now soliciting people to post postive reports on Trustpilot as well.",3
Logging into my account,I don't think every time I use my card that you guys turn around take a dollar fifty plus whatever the fee is where I get money out is bull crap is just I'm scam that you guys .can't take any money out sides a certain amount is bunch of bull crap it's my money I should be able to take it out anytime I want all lump sum but no I can't that's how you guys keep scamming people for freaking money off of the freaking card but I will be getting a bank and then no longer be dealing with you people all you guys are a scam,5
Great service,Wonderful I love Netspend,3

So far so good for my check 2 days‚Ä¶,"Nice job, got me into my account",3
Great job Netspend,Helpful answers my question,4
Awesome Service Thank You,"One drawback of this card is the initial card you get is replaced by a permanent Card. Unfortunately you cannot view the transactions on your initial card once you are issued your permanent card. Further, the customer service Representatives do not speak English as a first language and they are extremely difficult to understand.",5

Very good and satisfied,Great very convenient and works with Apple Pay,5
Great bank,"I would like to be able to see my Checks that are deposited in the app, not just what I receive. Looked all over the app to see if there is documentation on how much taxes I‚Äôve paid and other charges made by California. And the fact we are charged EVERY TIME we use our card for anything, adds up over time. Pay enough fees for withdrawals at bank, and charging us $1.50+ for every purchase is obscured",5
I am enjoying this card,I was pleased with how they handled my check and replacement check situation.No foul..no harm.Thank you. ::Donny green.,5
I love netspend,I had a good experience with Netspend. I have never had issues with the card or company. It's safe and reliable. :),4

I like how i can take money out‚Ä¶,I Love Netspend!! Always trust-worthy and getting better everyday. Highly recommended. Get your card today and download the App.,5
THE BESTTTTTTT,"I Use NetSpend in place of a cc so I don't get ripped off. Back on June 3rd,4th I make a purchase for $129.97 from auto forward. About 3 days into purchase I get the link to use this phone lookup service, I decide not to use it because I am traveling in and out of the US. Come back about 4 weeks later and ask for my money back. Marguerite tells me that all will be fixed and my refund will show up in 5to10 days. It never comes 12 days later I email Marguerite and am told that servers are down and I won't get refund for 2 weeks. By this time I had another short job overseas, get back 2 months later no refund keep sending emails and get no response. I called and spoke to a man called himself Mike. He said he would get to the bottom of it and would be in touch in 1 week. I the mean time a refund I had filed with NetSpend is in motion. Finally I am told that net spend can't find any evidence of my transaction. And my hearing for a refund has been denied. About 3or4 weeks later I kinda pissed lose my debit card and they send me another. I call to have it turned on. After this. I ask the girl who helped me for help with that purchase to auto forward. She gives me the dates the email used the amount the 4 last of card used, the time everything that the people who did the hearing on the refund said they didn't have. So in my eyes auto forward cheated me by not giving me service or refund ( service that I tried later to get.) And net spend did the same thing bullying to me claiming they didn't have the information that the girl who turned on my card had and gave to me .",5
Great employee and understanding,"I like the debit card but the only problem I have is if I use an ATM I get charged by the ATM usually like 3.50, but I also get charged again by netspend so to use an ATM costs around 7 dollars and upupl",5
I love netspend,I was supposed to got $100 with my next $100 deposit but I didn't receive it,5
Having been a prior Netspend customer‚Ä¶,My Amazon purchase was declined 4 days after I placed the order. I took NetSpend four days to ask me to verify my purchase.

Just,I ordered a new card paid 25$ for 2 day delivery and it took 5 days to get it to me. They wouldn't refund my 25$ not even partaily and the one month I had the card paid 40$ in fees for online purchases screw NetSpend,4
Great card no issues with my direct‚Ä¶,"The fees that go along with the card are terrible.  I have another prepaid card and don‚Äôt get charged any fees as long as my withdrawals are in network.  There are no limits to how many withdrawals I can make in a month.  There is no fee for declined transactions of balance inquires.  Also the $200 withdrawal limit is absurd as only the first two withdrawals are free, so if I need to withdraw $800, I‚Äôll get charged 2 fees for the other $400, unless I let you charge me $5.95 a month to have free withdrawals.  This card is a way to nickel and dime people out of their money.  I‚Äôll stay with my other cards cause this one is a no go.",4
Very efficient,Your customer service sucks. Online service app is horrible. The fees are ridiculous and you have to wait too long in order to deposit cash and clear your check. I had NetSpend when they started a very long time ago and to know that the service has went downhill since then very disappointed I will not refer to anybody.,5

I love Netspend,"I'm not happy with being charged to use credit, some place don't give you a choice of credit or debit so I'm loosing money, about ready to switch to a new card company, plus it only happens on one of the cards I have the other doesn't do that",5
Is a very awesome service,When I first purchase Netspend prepaid card I put $500 down on it and I never use it because I was in the hospital but now they‚Äôre saying that nobody knows where the $500 I bought it from Kroger‚Äòs and consumer Square nobody knows where my $500 is since then I‚Äôve had change the card because I didn‚Äôt activate the first card on time but I would still like to get my $500 that‚Äôs in stock between Netspend and Kroger‚Äòs other than that I have no issues with Netspend they doing pretty good with me I thought that was a activated my card he would upload the $500 on to My.

Nothing but helpful and always have the‚Ä¶,"When I bought the VISA in October and found that it could not be used due to restrictions on foreign users and I requested a refund. I had a terrible time contacting customer service when I did not receive the refund, due to your complex answering machine. When I finally got through I was promised a refund on the two VISAs within 7-10 days. The first refund arrived quickly on the small $25 card minus a fee. The second $500 card did not arrive until yesterday 1/13/22 (after three months), as a result of an intervention by the BBB and your agent Billy l Campbell. It also had a fee. I was Told by Billy that I would receive a refund on the fees and charges for the card which has not arrived. I hope the additional refunds will not take another 3 months. This whole experience has been very disturbing and frustrating.",5

I appreciate everything NetSpend has‚Ä¶,"I absolutely loved NetSpend, there was nothing they could do wrong until they did wrong.I got a mysterious text from NetSpend the said did you this transaction well clearly I had not, so upon responding no I was immediately stopped on my card which would normally be a good thing seeing as I don't want any further fraud against my card or myself, but it caught me at a very unopping time I lost my life insurance I lost my car insurance and I missed out on something that should have been great for me all because NetSpend decided to block my cards when I had money on it without even asking me first I should really only give them one star. But that's how it goes with NetSpend and right now I don't have a choice so there it is.",5

Very good and reliable services,Like it it will leave me too one day,5
In dealing with Netspend I have had‚Ä¶,"I love my Netspend card,and I really do get paid earlier others.",5
My first card had some purchases that I‚Ä¶,Great experience love the card and enjoy using it.,5
It‚Äôs ok rates can be a little high,When I had fraudulent charges you guys did not rule in my favor to give my money back because the person used my PIN number however I had explained that my whole bag with all my information including my PIN number was stolen if you looked at the ATM I am clearly not the person using the card the girl that did defraud and stole my money it has to be on camera but you never gave my money back,3
I really like your service it‚Äôs easy‚Ä¶,Sorry but I can never understand any of your operators because of their foreign accents. It makes doing my business almost impossible.,3
I've had no problems with NetSpend and‚Ä¶,Always get paid on early and always understanding,5
This is a great banking card but I had‚Ä¶,It charges  to much to load a card why should we have to pay to load money on your card then pay to take money off your card its crazy we loose all kinds of money but it comes in handy I will keep a few dollars just to have,5
Dependable,NetSpend keeps better track of my finances than I do.. they notify you promptly do me withdrawal goes unnoticed . For once I made a right choice with my funds.,5
Your amazing,"Honestly you are great and really 5 stars .I say 4 stars because there us always room for improvements no matter how good a company or corporation is. But mainly I would prefer to speak to a united states representative when I ask to speak to one . It is understandable that any company would want to spend less for or to pay employees but, you have to understand that there may be millions or thousands of customers in the United States üá∫üá∏ that are really skeptical of certain people handling their finances outside the United States.  Many issues I find is that they have a very difficult time understanding, speaking,, pronouncing and comprehending English. It is fine in a sense to hire outside üá∫üá∏us for customer service but if you do make sure that they are extremely proficient in English comprehension in every way as stated earlier and not the manager of that foreign office giving a job just to anyone of their friends of family when they are not proficient enough. I called several times and the background noise of loud music and shouting and talking was ridiculous, I thought I was calling a private residence. And occasion the customer service person was arrogant and so busy trying to drown me out and talking over me while I am explaining that got me more frustrated because it was impossible for them to help me because they so busy talking and not listening to what I want . But please let people who ask for an American representative SPEAK to an American representative..other than that I like the company and usefulness of the app it's great . Thank you.",5
Very good I like it!,"Netspend has been a blessing, it lets me know when,where and how my money is being deposited and spent. Ive never had any problems.thank you netspend",5
Great job NetSpend...,Well I know y'all do it for to protect your customers accounts and all but I've already went through two different cards they cut me off can't do this can't do that but other than that my money there where y'all are hounding y'all doing good,5
It easy,Wondering about the credit of last transaction from ad something I called about last week?,5
They won't even give MY money back.,Well I have been a great customer the way I know how to do however it is no need to be trust in this company because it can be a friend or family member know my name and last name they can gates a card through to my own identity and I lost more money instead it to save money so please help me understand how anyone can just give my last name and first name and they offer it gets a cardBecause this company I have been manipulated guts lost my identity people using my information absolutely easy way I just don‚Äôt get it even trying to get my own money I have lost trying to prove every minute myself to people who picking up a phone or a present in the company it was no answer for meü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,5

With this card it is not over draft,"As a first time experience Netspend is great! It is a hassle free, worry free way to do my online purchases & spending without the concerns of fraud and theft. So far so good!",4
Only thing I don't like is their is to‚Ä¶,"I love having my NetSpend card , I like the fact that every time I use my card it automatically sends me a receipt and balance! The only thing I don't like is that sometimes when I try and purchase things online or use my card on alot of things online it won't work.",5

Excellent,"Netspend was able to catch an unautherized purchase, I like being notified of all purchases when they happen, it allows me to verify purchases.",4
It's good I like all of the withdrawal‚Ä¶,Your customer service isn't good it takes a while to get some one on the phone then you can't understand what the person is saying plus when you call and you want to stop a transaction before it goes through then you have  to wait a long time to get your money  back,5
I don't think that there should be a‚Ä¶,Great support team they didn't send me in a circle chasing my tail.,4

No third party calls,I have never had a prepaid card that charges me for every transaction I make. It's convenient yes but way too costly. You even charge me a fee when I don't use my card.,5
Fees too high but services are very‚Ä¶,I love my NetSpend card it helps me to do everything that I need to do on time without waiting in lines and going through a bunch of problems with money situation it's easy to load money onto my card and go Eddie's only $3.95 to load the money onto my card so that's a plus and they only take out a dollar fifty when you use the card for purchases and that's 10 plus thank goodness being for all that you do for me and when I'm having transaction problems you always put the money back onto my card if something has went wrong at any place that I might have had transaction problems so thanks again for that,3
Very satisfied,Upon realizing that someone was making fraudulent transactions I immediately contacted NetSpend support where then they opened a dispute claim and was able to return my money to my account. They were very vigilant about checking my accounts and making sure no other card's could be compromised. Every step of the way NetSpend stayed in contact with me and helped me secure my identity. Thank you NetSpend!! üëç,4
Like the card so far,No longer have you. You charge money 1.90 for every transaction that I had. No can do for me!! Goodbye,4
I love netspend to the simple fact they‚Ä¶,I just don't like the charges for using the card,4

I love the services at netspend,"The service is direct , quick and straight to the point.",1
Thank You for your help..,Well first of all I did not get no savings account like they said second of all none of direct deposit free if we have to pay a 1.95 for every time we used to card at checkout or gas pump and the ATM plus the fee for the ATM to me that's not free,5
I have always found Netspend customer‚Ä¶,thanks you for the account,4
Stopped my card from fraud thankyou but‚Ä¶,I find having a NetSpend card is easy to put funds onto and easy-to-use at the store I find it convenient and I really like the service that you guys provide thank you for making it easy.,5
Everything is good so far,"i hate the fact that you only allow $200 withdrawal, and charge 2.95 to get it",5
I REALLY love the NEW CARD & services‚Ä¶,I got this card cause of a loan company.I am glad I got to pay the 5 dollars I charfed up. The net spend is great. Thank you.,5
Outstanding Services,Wonderful. I love the messages about my recent purchases. It's an easy way to keep my records. I truly appreciate your methods.  Thank you kindly.,4
I don‚Äôt like Netspend as a whole they did,Great card I have never been so satisfied with a prepaid card,5
Great card to use and have.,"I love this company so much. I have several cards with them. Only thing I would change, I would make it where you can send and receive money from any company, and not just NetSpend.",5
Not so bad!üôÇ,"I was having an issue receiving my direct deposit from my new workplace. I was very frustrated after waiting almost five days after my new payroll company said it should have been in there. It was already processed and everything on my employers side. Netspend customer service did try and track down the actual deposit but was unable to tell me exactly when and at what time these funds would be available to me. I will say however, through all of my frustration, the netspend associate was able to remain calm and courteous to me during the duration of the call. I was very impressed considering my own frustration level at the time. these things do happen with a new direct deposit company linked to an account but it does not lower the want or need for that money any more. so I appreciate the associates patience with me,",4
Your app is a little confusing for me,"The many Products offered , made My Experience, Confusing and  Dumb - Founding . Too many undressed transition periods, involving Redundant Setups . Didn‚Äôt appreciate the Dialogues along with getting My Services intimated . Not feeling to confidently sure with The Future Bankings Needs I‚Äôll be subjected to , Moving Forward ?",3
Great,I love my netspend card I pay all my bills with it. But why I gave it a 4 causei feel that $1.50 is alot just for using your own money to buy  or pay something. I love the card bit that's the only thing I don't like.I ü§óü§ó,4
I like this app,I love how you let me have my government check early so i can pay bills early so i know what i can pay in time.,5
Yall never told me yinz charge 5‚Ä¶,It‚Äôs fast easy and never have any problems when using this card I can reload at anytime if I need to pay a bill or order something I really enjoy using this service thanks,4
So far been great,Great company with great customer engagement.,1
I'm very happy with NetSpend I use my‚Ä¶,They closed my account where I disputed some transactions that was made from my account after my card was stolen with my card and all other cards....,5
Most convenient & accessable prepaid‚Ä¶,"Charge way to much if someone going over their limit, no chip in card",5
I'm a little bit confused on how to use‚Ä¶,"Great service , convenient, and reliable",5
Good service,You have fees. Will be switching to another card .,4
I love NetSpend,"I don‚Äôt appreciate that you can only load $500 onto the card at one time and for every purchase, you get charged another $1.50. üëé",5
Reliable and easy,Not impressed with every time I use the card you charge me $1.50 a transaction will do away with this card very soon,5
Timely deposit,ALL IS GOOD AND I AM SATISFIED WITH SERVICE,5
I love it.,This product is not great. In the fine print you get charge a $1.50 for every transaction. Any amount placed on this card gets removed quick due to charges. The card is best left on the self and not to be given out for personal use or as a gift.,5
Happy,The customer service agent stayed with me on the phone the whole time through teaching me how to change my password even though I was getting very aggravated he did great.,5
Their fees are super high,Netspend has helped me with immediate money transactions to keep me on track with my bill payment schedule. Thank you Netspend!,5
I have found a lot of gas stations‚Ä¶,My direct deposit was messed up never received my check then after weeks they found it then made me wait again and then my employer got it and had to request a check and I had to wait even longer worst experience ever almost lost my car the customer service people did not know what was going on very unprofessional making me wait  30 to 45 minutes just to talk to a supervisor ur better off with a different card holder!!,1
Reliable !,Not liking the new All Access Card . To many FEES with it that is not told to customers before getting the card,4
Atm incident,So far so good I'm new so I need to see how it goes,5
Other than atm fees and monthly charge‚Ä¶,Netspend  pretty  good service I will keep that as long good service,5
I absolutely love Netspend !!!!!!!!,Service is good. Having trouble downloading app to my phone.,5
I have been with Netspend for many‚Ä¶,I was able to use it for just what I needed. Its quick and easy.,5
Ben using net spend for years never let‚Ä¶,Net spend is wonderful always on time .and no problems,5
Love Net spend,I wish I could overdraft more like what‚Äôs my limit?,5
"This entire platform unstable, BE CAREFUL","Most of the time,  the customer service agents are usually friendly and fulfill my needs in a timely fashion.  They are thorough and make sure that they have done all that they can do when servicing a customer's request.",5
Fees are rediculous!!!!,The experience  with this card has been a nightmare.You guys have no physical bank to go into to draw out my OWN money if I needed more then the max 256 I can draw out. Two when I had questions about a transaction I didn't know about u guys AUTOMATICALLY canceled the card out without waiting for me to get an answer from the company with the dispute transaction and against my permission. You have customer service reps who can barely speak English and don't listen very well. You also when transferring funds won't transfer fer the whole thing if its more.then $1500 and charge a 4 .95 transfer fee every transaction insuring u will get almost 10.00 if its more then one transaction. It all added up to a very horrible experience  this card and company are the worse I wouldnt recommend  this card or service to anyone.,1
I love netspend,I like Netspend became it gives you the balance and also let‚Äôs you know where you spent your money. It‚Äôs not tied to my bank account and that‚Äôs a relief to know‚Ä¶,1
Love my card,great job! i love it!,5
I love NetSpend,"Quality is stable responsible accountability is what I have observed so far, thanks.",5
I have not had any problems with my‚Ä¶,Well I needed to get extra money until I started back working and couldn‚Äôt from Netspend. I was told that I have a 250 overdraft amount and couldn‚Äôt get it all so this put me back further than paying bills on time,5
Love it,Love this service. Especially the online check capture service.,5
I do not like being charged 1.50 by‚Ä¶,I have had direct deposits without any knowledge of them. I would like a text when I have any activity on my card account. I haven't been notified for any activity unless I call and find out what my balance is. Other than that I am overall satisfied with it.,5
It‚Äôs not friendly accessible to switch‚Ä¶,Works good easy to use no problems,1
I have good service with them for over‚Ä¶,I believe you all done great done everything you said you do took care of me real good,3
Great Service,It locked me out so I can't out in my temporary password,5
i like cause i  can see how much im‚Ä¶,I don‚Äôt understand why I can‚Äôt get 5 or 6 hundred dollars at one time from an ATM machine. I shouldn‚Äôt have to do 3 transactions to get the money I need.,5
No problems with company as of the‚Ä¶,It was able to cash my check via the app,5
AWESOME!!!!,EASY TO USE AND EASY TO LOAD,5
I love it..minus the $5.00 fees..,I paid $25 Igor 1-2 days shipping on my card and ordered it on December 30 and it is January 7 and still haven‚Äôt received it. And no one will email me back about when it‚Äôs coming in or about my refund for the $25 or nothing.,5
It's not fair that you still charge od‚Ä¶,Happy I can use Netspend to order things online.,5
Is good,We have been with NetSpend for 6 years and have been pleased with them since day one. Highly recommend if you want on line banking with no high fees,1
You are superior!,I can't get a live representative on the phone,4
Excellent card!,"This is a great card, I don‚Äôt have to carry my bank debit card to use for purchases, especially when you go to sporting event and the arena you are in is totally cashless!!! Easy to add monies onto it through Walmart small fee but funds are instantly added to your card!!",5
Slow to receive card,"The only bad experience I've had is getting the card disabled. I've racked up almost a years worth of monthly payments, since I cant find the card, i cant shut it off. And i doubt i pay the monthly fine since I've mot used it since January of last year. Otherwise a great reloadable card.",5
I love using Netspend,I love that I can get paid early,1
Very professional and straight to the‚Ä¶,I JUST THINK $1.50 IS TO MUCH TO CHARGE EVERYTIME YOU MAKE A PURCHASE. A ONE TIME FEE SHOULD BE SUFFICE.,5
You did great this year with my tax‚Ä¶,"Hello, today's  debit cards and credit cards are designed  with chips in them to make using them easier your cards doesn't  have one it would be so nice if you designed  your cards with the chip! It would make my life more easier to thank you a loyal customer.",5
I really like netspend and I  highly‚Ä¶,I have only returned to NetSpend recently. So I can only base my review on NetSpend in the past which I was fine with. Their customer service has always been helpful and informative.,5
NetSpend - Best By Far,It was ok I really don't know what you are thinking about but I get a net spend card at least couple days a month I only use a brinks NetSpend card and I need to upgrade that one because it has been a good card.,5
Excellent,I have always been completely satisfied with the service from Netspend.  Many members of my family also have Netspend  accounts and are happy with the service as well.   Thank you    Jack Washington,5
Very helpful,Your service very bad hard get your money off all the charge you do,5
Customer service almost always doesn't‚Ä¶,Terrible experience with the Customer service. Rude with a care less attitude. Not just one representative but the majority. I have been trying to get a refund for 6 months now and it is now getting ridiculous. 27 phone calls and 17 emails. I will have no choice but to join the other thousands of disgruntled customers and start a claim with the Federal and State Trade Commission.    I would not recommend this company to anyone.,5
You are amazing,"My experience with NetSpend came on time,some employees you can barely comprehend what they're saying,but overall my experience been pretty fair",1
Love it,Just would like to be able to transfer money from One account to another and them not having to be the same company our card,5
I love my net spend card,Needed money on my netspend card so I could order some much needed items. Went to the store and told I needed to put money on my card and BAM! It was put on my card. Easy. I was then able to order whatever I needed. Thank you netspend.,5
Helping resetting my password,Its been great knowing my amount on my acct.keep up the good work.,5
Love my services and how easy it was to‚Ä¶,I like NetSpend because it allows me to get my money ahead of time and they send SMS alerts which I love keeping track of my money,5
Good customer service üëç,Hmmmm like any other check cashing banking system it work and is beyond super. Convenient!,5
excellant service,I have been using netspend for over 10 years and will continue to do so I can use it somewhere I go,5
Grate debit card service,It's ok. Haven't used it to much to give a good opinion one way or the other.,5

I like that I don't have to worry about‚Ä¶,"I didn‚Äôt know that there were many different hidden charges that folks need to be aware of. I was buying items at various places and when I checked my balance there was a charge for every purchase I made. After contacting customer service, they did inform me of the policy and encouraged me to upgrade to the plan which has a monthly $5.95 charge per month. So just be aware!",5
Netspend has been reliable,Very easy to use,5
I am so grateful for NETSPEND,It was all good until netspend started charging me $2 every time I swipe my card,4
Love it I have been with you guys for‚Ä¶,Recommend for anyone needing an account... üíú,5
I've used it for years now,Dislikes $1.50 charges after every purchase i make. Very upset will be canceling card and service soon.,5
Best Review,"I did some online ordering using my NetSpend card, which to me was much safer than using my bank card!!  I have also used NetSpend for small purchases at stores, getting gas, etc. It's nice that you can only use the money that's on the card, until you refill it again.",5

Very flexible and works with you,They just gave me a hard time changing cars and I really didn't like that cuz I've been with them for several years,5
No issues,I like getting the direct deposit early but there are a lot of fees coming out of my check. I've had NetSpend a month and I'm down 25 dollars. Plus I never got the direct deposit bonus they said I'd get,5
I really like Netspend,My wife and I spent hours on the phone because she had sent me code for us both to get 20 credit but we never received it. Very disappointing to spend all that time on phone and still no credit!,5

Great,i been trying to get netspend to empty my acountand close it down but they keep making excuses my question is what is the motive for refusing to give me my money out my account and shut down?,5
I called into Netspend Not an issue I‚Ä¶,"Great work at taking my hard earned money, for fees, and charges for first putting money on the card, then again for taking the money off the card. Double maybe triple the amount if it's cash I want. I just wanted to take the time to thank you, for robbing me with a handshake and a smile, for the simple reason that English isn't my first language, so I can't rob you properly.",5
So far Netspend worked good I was able‚Ä¶,It's been a great and convenient card to have. The app is user friendly and not a negative experience to date.,5

Its good,"I love my Netspend All Access Card!I enjoy getting paid two days earlier,very helpful!!",5
The 1.50 fee every time I use it is‚Ä¶,The reason I rated you one is because every time I try to get a hold of somebody it takes act of Congress to get through to talk somebody on one on one basis,4
Good service,"Too many troubles with poorly trained, outsourced customer support and attaining money stolen from me.  Immense surcharges everywhere but their one saving grace is that they act like a bank and can allow transactions and wires at most anytime.. I appreciate that.",3

Really like having this nice getting‚Ä¶,No hidden fees. Easy to understand.,5
All I have to say is this is the best‚Ä¶,very expensive fee,5
I love net spend,I love the NetSpend service but y'all gotta start getting me my paychecks two days early as promised cause I do have bills to pay an children to feed overall great service,5
The agent was very kind and listened to‚Ä¶,Netspend had suspicion that someone else had made a charge so they restricted my card until they could verify it with me and I'm so glad they did or that someone else would have gotten away with all of my money on my card. Netspend has great customer service and I would recommend them to anyone anytime. Thank you Netspend,5
I Love NetSpend! Thank you!!!,I'm very happy with NetSpend no problems here.,5
The things I really need I'm able to‚Ä¶,I'm not displeased with Netspend other than the fact that if I want to withdraw up to $1000 it costs me $9. $300 each transaction with a $3 fee :(,5
I am very very pleased awesome job,"Your in the business of helping almost  exclusively people struggling to get by, your empty corporate mind cares more about money than its own customers.",5
Simple and easy,Customer service was terrible.  Didn't help me resolve my issue. Had to take care of it myself.,5
Wouldn‚Äôt recommend,"I've only had my card about 2 months and so far  I haven't had any issues at all.I changed to Netspend because I was trying to put money on MyVanilla  card and it kept rejecting my money. I've had that card about 5 or 6 years now and every month, I cashed my paycheck and put my money on it. Now all of a sudden, it wouldn't work. That's when I grabbed the Netspend card. I've always heard good things about Netspend but never changed because at the time, I was very happy with MyVanilla card.. Not any more.. I will let you know if I have any issues but for now, I'm happy. Happy New Year to all of you.kathy",5
Thanks,Netspend is extremely good!,2

NetSpend has been very efficient and‚Ä¶,They said we are suppose to get our money two day early but I don't get my money until one day early. From  payroll,5
I‚Äôve been using Netspend for sometime‚Ä¶,I didn't realize you charge a fee for every single transaction.,5
Too many fees,"Money is tight these days n your high charges for using the card are ridiculous. I'm charged twice for using the card, those charges add up to more than any bank would charge. I'll be canceling the card if I don't get a portion of the fees returned",5
I have use net spend for about10 years‚Ä¶,Awesome  customer employee awesome all around and that's a shocker,2
Netspend charges $1.50 per transaction,I had a horrible time with customer service representatives trying to transfer money from one net spend card to another. All I got from service rep. Was one question after another that had nothing to do with the transfer I desired.,5

Everything I could ask for in this‚Ä¶,"I haven't had it too Long. But so far, so good. The o ly thing I have to look into is the direct deposit promo. I thought I earned $100 by receiving direct deposit and I have not seen it. But the app is very easy to navigate and understand.",1

Okay.,Well when I originally got my pink card almost immediately they told me I was eligible to upgrade it to the black card so I ordered it when I got my black card I was told that my check would go on to that card and it didn't so somebody got my pink card and spent all my funds so I was misled by being told that Marilyn baby rendered homeless and everything else I hope that you guys will help me to retrieve my funds back and I will continue to use NetSpend,5

Easy,Not sure just using the features hopefully there as useful,5
I love it it's very dependable,I love the alerts. Im very happy,5
Getting better,Great bank very easy to get started,5
Fees suck can't deposit over 200.00‚Ä¶,Net spend is pretty Ight only thing I don‚Äôt like is the overdraft fee 20$ for every overdraft you do over 5$ that‚Äôs a lot of money sometimes people might need to overdraft till next week and you charge 20$ that‚Äôs crazy other then that netspend is Ight,4
Great üëçüòÉ,The only thing that sucks is paying the $5 a month th besides that it‚Äôs a great card,3
I have had a excellent experience with‚Ä¶,"I ordered a phone case a month ago and it came up from California, only to be shipped rite back to the seller. The place I ordered from hasn't contacted me or anything and the eBay site I ordered fromhas no contact info. Of course I'm the only one that loses out here. NetSpend got their 2 bucks, he got his 15 and now I can't get ahold of them. I'm not sending a letter of dispute. Funny how everything is now electronic except the one part to get my money back. I'm cutting my card up and not using NetSpend again. I went to the gas station to get gas with the last 3 dollars I have until payday and I'm on empty but of course my card was declined. Maybe you should change your policy about the 2 dollar transaction fee when someone only has 10 dollars or less. Maybe you could have just waited until I had my direct deposit and either with monthly fee or that day the 2 dollar charge could have been taken then But to make sure you get your money first is greedy ass bullsh*t.  That rite there is why you'll never get another dime off me.",5
No complaining very good service!,Very positive constructive company a lil confusion over when the Christmas payment was going to be provided giving peoples ignorance and non gratefulness for the earliest providence reading how people were calling netspend even at the observation of the recepent of checks calendar providence but me and my family were grateful the day before Christmas my children receive their gifts excellently thank to the netspend thank you for your time service and assistance highly appreciated,5
Love It,NetSpend is awesome with all the features that I love!! So convenient. I have been with NetSpend for years and they have not failed me yet!!  Never had any issues. Customer service is very helpful! Good work guys! All thumbs up!,5
It cost a lot a month,"Went to 3 differant ATMs couldnt withdraw any money,talked to some yesterday and he told me to try another ATM,NO problem paying a couple bills though",5
Highly recommend!,Love NetSpend easy to use and easy to load .,2
Great job uhh,The costume  service sux n yall dont have  no idea want yall are doing n yall mess up my kids x mas I am gone do everything  that I can to spread the word about yall so no one goes thru want I went thru I give yall -1 start case there isn't one for -0,5
Told premium card was being sent never‚Ä¶,Worst ever. I will never recommend anyone to use them. They blocked my card without my knowledge. Asking for personal information which I didn‚Äôt have to use when I purchased it. If your thinking about getting one choose someone else,5
I really like the service of a prepaid‚Ä¶,I gave u one star because my check was lost and no one could answer any of my questions and no one would put me thru to a supervisor even after I asked for one more than once. But before this you were doing great,4
I honestly really enjoy Netspend,"I'm not a big fan of all the fees when you deposit, monthly and other charges I think I'm just gonna stick with my AMEX serve card cause they don't charge all those fees",4
Love it,was able to get a refund of a closed account promptly,5
Very happy with this card!!!,Amazing! I love it!,5
I like the convenience,"Netspend has always been there to help me, in any financial situation and been willing to help resolve any problems. They protect my money from scammers and even when I make mistakes.  They are very understanding.",5
Great but just done like extra charges‚Ä¶,"I have had a NetSpend account steadily for over a year and initially when they first opened over 12 years ago.  The only thing that I believe could be changed is they only allow $500 cash to be deposited at a time. You can deposit $500 cash a number of times in a row and they charge each time. so I don't know why they couldn't do up to the max for one deposit, unless the sole purpose is to make more money.  other than that NetSpend  service has been awesome.  they respond quickly to questions, deposits have been immediate and cancelled transactions are refunded immediately.",5
Good,I love the card company but I just don‚Äôt know why you would charge someone $5 to immediately deposit their check into your account it‚Äôs outrageous,5
Netspend has excellent card service,I have been a Netspend customer for years and have always been very satisfied,5
Great,Because they have been nice too me through out my pains n suffuring. And they let me overdraft when I'm depressed and. Just very loyal company,5

So far it been a good deal,U gays need to get it together. I'm about to get somebody different.,5
I really like netspend!,Good customer service. Easy to use,4
I am very happy with my Netspend card,"The Netspend card is a good alternative for those of us that can't get a traditional bank account.

Love it,Great banking experience since the first time used hasn't changed,5
THE WORST APP I EVER EXPERIENCED IN MY‚Ä¶,I requested a new card In the beginning of Dec and  still have not  received it and the only way I could get my direct deposit money was to buy a new one considering every penny I had to my name was deposited on my missing card buying one was not an option for me so now  we are on the 29th of December and still no card which means no money you all have my Email address as well as my phone number I'm surprised a banking company that is a significantly large don't care enough about their card holders to do follow ups on their customer service  experience  so now what do i do about a new card  or getting my money off of the old card please help thanks,5
Netspend is Awesome,Canceled a card cause it was lost and yall issued me a new card but didn't cancel the lost card. Now I have almost $100 in charges yall still haven't done anything about. Where's my money!?!,1
Netspend Rocks,Enjoy the services and I can always get ahold a human when problem arise and my money is refunded back to my card at timely manner only thing I wish u did was if a customer uses and has a card for a long period of time they should receive 100 dollars back at the end of the year like green dot did,5
Everything was great I would recommend‚Ä¶,Seriously no matter where you use this card it takes money every single time. I was getting gas and was shocked when the $30 I thought I had left on it was gone. When I reviewed the transaction history they took $1.50 off every time it was swiped at stores gas stations you name it. Seriously regret getting this card it's the worst card I've ever used .,5
You guys are very professional you said‚Ä¶,I have tried to upload checks to my account virtually and I have a zero luck and it's impossible to add money to your account,5
Your card sucks you charge for‚Ä¶,Best way to bank without all those fees. I really love being able to get to paid 2 days earlier.,5
Very satisfied with this service,Somehow my card stays in the negative and doesn't take the money off the card whenever I buy something with the card right away.It will be better if the money was took off as soon as I  buy something instead of being pending,1
Great job!,I like the simplicity of adding money when I want to order on the i9nternet,4
I really like it,You do pretty good you keep track and nobody hack,5
Wonderful!!!,The best thing is there is no chip on the card those always gave me issues,5

Some one tryed to steal from my‚Ä¶,I can only transfer money from my bank account to netspend account or card. I can't transfer money on my netspend card to my bank account!,4

pretty good experience like it alot,Complicated to activate card. Never had to take that long for any other card I‚Äôve had.  Automated system sent me to a representative who asked me the whole card number and my address twice. Odd,1
I would like my refund on gas because‚Ä¶,"I had a claim in over this $210 that has gone missing due to an error on racetracs side, however i still have had a horrible experience trying to reach you all and try to figure out how I get sold a gift card that doesnt work because of ‚Äútime constraints‚Äù and I can‚Äôt get my money back. And while it used to be a pending transaction it is now completely gone.",4
Since I have started with NetSpend i‚Ä¶,"I've only used the app and card a few times, I haven't had any issues. I will continue to use it as long as there aren't any issues.",4
great csrd,I would rate you lower but well you know.  just by charging for no activity is absolutely ludicrous.,4
Netspend,MetaBank Netspend is my last Bank standing with identity theft in progress. My account has been safely guarded with them for many years. My entire income is now deposited with this Bank. I trust them and appreciate their prompt service any time I call.  5 Star Bank.,5

Easy to use and reload.,"You failed to mention a usage fee, took the total amount of my gift card before I had the chance to use it.

I really enjoy netspend,Keep charging me fees even when im not using it.,5
I love this NetSpend is easy quick the‚Ä¶,"This card was a gift to my spouse. In order to put more funds on it, I had to have the card. How do I secretly get the card from my spouse and then put it back? Very difficult. I tried to write a personal check but the camera would not accept the back of the check because it was to light. There are probably other ways to accomplish this but I am very technically challenged.",5

I love the card,"I'm very happy with my account.I've been a customer over 2 years and I have never had a problem.. even when my card was shut down, my mistake. I had been sent an All Access card and kept it for 2 years, glad I did because they instantly turned it on AND switched my social security to the new account (I just had to call to make sure it went through smoothly).I now have overdraft protection and can be in the negative in case of an emergency!!I'm very happy üòÅ",3

I think that this card is great,I gave 3 stars because i tried two times to pay my car and it was kicked back because my name is not first on the account. A friend had to help me because my credit score was low so im the cosigner. But because my name is not first you keep kicking it back,5
NetSpend is great,Awful customer service they hang up on you they don‚Äôt do what you ask them to and they just simply don‚Äôt care,5

Since ordering my permanent debit card‚Ä¶,"Been using netspend card since 2008 for direct deposit. Netspend don't charge a lot for basic banking. Direct deposit, visa debit card, free money orders, and check cashing for a small monthly fee.",5
Very useless and very rude people,"Once I established the connection, I have had no problems. Had a little trouble getting the account open though, after I had put my first $500 on it. I had bought the card for use in an emergency, and we had one.",1

I love Netspend get paid 4 days early‚Ä¶,"The website, the accuracy and quick loading times are great but the loading fees @ $3.95 are to high. and the per charge fees are completely out of line when it comes to very small purchases, ie, for example $1.50 for a red box purchase of $2.12. And $9.95 per month is high for unlimited use.",5
I'm not allowed to overdraw what I like‚Ä¶,I like that I get my check early and service is great,5

Great service no problems so far‚Å∑,My card is locked and I have to get my check. And I have been trying to get hold of someone who can help me,5
Ok ok,I just had alot of problems with the app and the set ups in the app.,5
Easy setting up,I‚Äôm very satisfied with the card and usability. But I do wish I could waive the monthly fees by depositing a certain amount of money on account that my job doesn‚Äôt do direct deposit. If I deposit my paycheck every week I should get the same benefits.,5
So far I‚Äôve been using net spend for‚Ä¶,I don't like it because you are restricted to a limit of transfer bank to bank per day . I feel like I don't have control of my own money,5
Greatest!!!,He charged too much to give money he charged too much to put money in,5
Love my card,"Once this dispute gets done I will never ever use you again!!!!!!!!!!!! IT SHOULD NEVER TAKE 30-60 DAYS FOR YOU TO DECIDE ON A DISPUTE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU DO NOTHING BUT TIE UP THE CLIENTS MONEY, THESE CARDS COME A DIME A DOZEN, GIVE THAT SOME THOUGHT!",5

NetSpend is amazing,"Great service, fast , efficient , #Greeat",5
Love getting my paycheck two days‚Ä¶,Netspend? NetSpend I would definitely recommend them to my friends they treated me great I have no problems thank you for the good service.,5
When a bill comes earlier than expected...and so does your money!!!,"So far so great. Except the fact that I pay to be an all-access member and yet j still have to pay 2.95 to use my card at ATM, Plus whatever fee the ATM charges. So around 7$ just to pull money out. When I thought I got 1 free ATM withdrawal a month. Plus have been trying to cancel subscriptions and can't figure out how but the amount is still getting deducted. The app needs a way to see every account that is trying to take out money from the account so you can cancel the subscription from the net spend app itself. Other than that I love it now that I am an all-access member because I don't 200$ in fees before I started paying to be a member because I didn't know you got charged EVERY SINGLE TIME You used the card anywhere. whether it was online, store, atm, anything.",3
Thanks NetSpend card for the great‚Ä¶,I really like Netspend except for the fees that are charged for all transactions,5
I love my netspend it fast i get paid 2‚Ä¶,So far no complaints everything easy to access and use I like your service so far,5
Sweet,Don't like that they charge u to make a purchase. $1 or $2 either way it adds up and I need that little extra. And charge so much to reload wherever the location.,5
It is a good way to keep you money safe,"Love it!.. I have been with, i have been with Netspend for year's now. I always get paid early customer service is helpful, i have two a account's with, direct deposit.",5
I have been with NetSpend for 15 years‚Ä¶,I got no complaints so far so I would recommend Netspend to others.,5
I love it,I would have five stars if you hadn't charged me five dollars a month for all access NetSpend and change my account number,5
No free ATM locations,The fee so they you don't have to pay a fee its pretty big for just a month like 10 that's a Netflix plan .... ans if you don't pay you'll still have to pay a fee sorry I use to love netspent but since covid I cant spends on alot of stuff so I've move to chime no fees at all plus they build your cerdit,5
Netspend is really Great!!!,"$1.50 per use is a little high. If I use my card 5times a day that's $7.50 I really can't afford to lose that kind of money to use the card. And it won't accept my check for mobile despoist an I knw there very good checks that won't bounce. But thank u got giving me the opportunity to do business with u guys st Netspend.Thank you,           Dale Rife",1
Money on time is great,Good very good,5
Just great,Had some fraudulent issues with the unauthorized use of my  netspend card sent what info they asked for which was supposed to aide in and speed up the process of getting the funds back into my account.plus I have to wait for my new card because of this wasn't able to buy gifts for my girlfriend for Christmas. Thanx Netspend,5
Arc thrift store,This is a very good bank very trustworthy but you need to have check cashing how come you don't have check cashing that's the only thing I see you don't have.,5
So far so good,I like the fact of getting paid 2 days early also you have great customer service.,1
I DONT KNOW I NOT GET PAID 2 DAYS‚Ä¶,The staff is very helpful and polite! They answer my questions quick and are very knowledgeable!,4
Fantastic,"I was charged for overdraft fees and they didn't know that I was signed up for it. I was receiving $300 a month for the child tax credit. I received a new card in the mail randomly and I chose to activate it because my other card was looking used up. I had a negative balance so I had to call to activate it. Apparently, this is when I was put on overdraft protection. According to your guidelines, $300 a month doesn't qualify for the protection but somehow I was eligible. I was charged 5 times, $100 in fees. I called about it but was not satisfied and I was not directed to a supervisor. I was put on hold and when they came back on I was told I would be reimbursed $40 and that was the best it was going to get. This is all right before Christmas and I practically begged for relief but to no avail. I can't help but think I was refunded a partial amount of money that I was owed since I didn't know I was signed up for protection.",2
There are a lot of great things on the‚Ä¶,The additional 1.50 charge every time you use the card is outrageous!,4
My fiscal agent was slow in sending my‚Ä¶,"I Love using Net spend ,,and the customer service is Great ,I am well please with your business",5
"Love my bank, fast ,reliable and safe",Very good ! Easy to work with !,5
They have always been reliable,It's like if u buy something for 2$ dey charge 5$ n dats not right,5
I can't understand why there's a fee‚Ä¶,My account was locked because I used the wrong four digit pen I called customer service they gave me a new pen but I still cannot log in to check activity and balance,5
Love the card,"This is honestly a great card card to go with, except at the same time it isn't. I'm not sure it's because it's a prepaid card that it does this but 9/10 times the purchases you make have a $1.50 charge. Whether it be going to the store and grabbing a quick item, going out to eat, purchasing something or even paying a bill, there is a $1.50 fee charged to your card. There's so far two different fees I've seen which is a PIN fee that charges $1.50 when you use your 4 Digit PIN. The other fee is an online signature fee I believe? Which basically means whenever you make a payment online it charges you and it did this with Amazon.com and even when I paid my internet bill. It's really not that much of an issue but if you do get a card with this company then be very cautious of that fee because within a week and half of using the card I've already been charged around $20 that could've gone to different things.",4
Great service,"I'm tired of having to give the Social Security my account number, I've had to do it 4 times with in a month.",5
Really good on time deposit actually a‚Ä¶,Really reliable. With all the extras.,5

I love netspend will recommend anyone‚Ä¶,"5star for customer service, since I just starting starting January if anything like phone conservation l had over the phone. I will.  Merry Christmas AND Happy New Year.",5
I love this card except the fees,"I liked getting the stimulus money from the government on my Netspend Mastercard.  I also enjoyed choosing a longer spelled out version of my name on a Netspend Visa.  If anything great happens I like the Mastercard getting the bonus money.  It is easy, fair and square without solicitation, if I can put cash, into my other Netspend card.  I look forward to getting smarter about all the options and possibly sweepstakes.  Glad my postal mail is updated and I like everything to look over about Netspend.",5

Very good.,very simply to use with no previous experience with a prepaid credit card.,5
Good,I don't like how it cost so much to use atm and using my card to make purchases it's also hard to get to a live person overall the fees are what bothers me and the atm limit amounts,5
I am very pleased with netspend.,"I have had no problems at all what so ever, in fact I would recommend NetSpend to friends and family.",5
My Iced k üòÄü§£ 3,"Wonderful service and I can keep track of my spending as I make transactions, very helpful and love the 2 day early direct deposit for pay days!",5

Love,I really don't like the fact that I'm charged so much for the overdrafts and doesn't give me longer time to pay my overdraft before 20$ is charged and also I have a small limit to overdraft. I would like to have a higher amount to overdraft as well and then the fee that I'm being charged wouldn't be a problem.. it's hard times now with the covid pandemic and indeed of more emergency cash that would definitely be paid either by my work or my child tax credit. Iv been a customer for a long time which should count for something. I left state employees to NetSpend aswell and would like better perks . I'm a father and run a buisness. Thanks for your time hope changes can be made to make me A happier dedicated and more trustworthy customer to you owners of NetSpend. Merry Christmas happy holidays . And also do you help with business loans or ppp. I'd like to better my business and bring more customers to NetSpend aswell. Or early tax money  or early child tax credit that's due to me in March?,5
I have found that  Netspend is very‚Ä¶,I can get reloaded places near me. I can also use every where's in the United States.,5

You take a lot of mony every single‚Ä¶,I don't have no problem with the card only problem I have is I cannot take all my money off at one time,5
I like some features but I don't like‚Ä¶,"I had a horrible experience. My card was compromised no trouble there. Thank you for  catching that. The most unorganized business experience comes in. It was 3 days before Christmas when I card got blocked. I was in total disbelief. I had no excess to my funds. I was told a new card would be sent, but I needed money. So a representative of the company said ""good get a temporary card "" I did so to transfer money from one card to another.  I spent $22.95 for  the temporary card. Called back got transferred to customer service. A man responded, I told him the situation. Began helping me,he was asking me questions. He had a very heavy accent. Didn't understand his questions. He said I failed my security questions to call back tomorrow. Called back 2days before Christmas. Got same result but this time the lady said that my permanent card was in the mail and she couldn't transfer funds until I activated my permanent card. I haven't received it just. She just kept saying sorry. Ask to speak to a supervisor. I was on hold  for 45 minutes. Finally I got my transfer of funds. I want to know why it took talking to the supervisor for results. I  will be transferring my funds and closing account. I  lost faith in your company.",1
Whenever I have a problem netspend is‚Ä¶,It take $1.50 Everytime I swipe the card don‚Äôt like that,3
"I have no issues with netspend,my money‚Ä¶",Terrible customer service. Pass the buck and resolved nothing They caused me to lose over $400 and then lied to me about it. Never reached out to resolve anything.,5

Fee's,I really do get my pay faster. The fees are excessive,4
Your Services practiced and always‚Ä¶,Bad info given and on follow up no help and I was lied to about fees when my electronic funds came late for first time ever. No consideration taken into account.  Will be posting and reporting netspend,1
I am very happy with y'all,"i paid for texting when money is being withdrawl. no texting  and i had a transaction dispute and i didnt want my card blocked,and i also tried to get the other card activated so i can tranfermy money to another card and i colud not be activateed.",5
Excellent Service.,I never get any of my bank statement I ask for,5
Great experience with NetSpend,Amazing services!,5
All good,I have had NetSpend for over 4 yrs and I have never had a problem,5
Too much,"This card has a fee of either 10/mo.or 1.50 per transaction.if you need to withdraw cash you are charged a fee by NetSpend,a fee to the ATM terminal,and the 1.50 transaction fee.",4
Nothing bad to say,Netspend access card is a great way to save money and gain credit.,3
I get paid 2 days early,"Wouldn't activate my card because of ""identity verification"" issues despite providing everything they asked for (every single form of ID I have), and then took 3 months so far refunding my $500 which I still haven't received in the mail after multiple complaints. I'm hoping they'll do something after the Better Business Bureau called them about this.",5
I like the NetSpend card because it's‚Ä¶,"Everything I could want in a prepaid card, money is available within 30 minsabs have had no issues to date",5
Has been well no porblem,I have a prepaid card that I only used 1 time last year. I went to put money on it and it had a hold on it. I called and I owe $87 on it. They have been charging me $9.95 a month service fee. I have never heard of such a thing. Why would I get a prepaid card with a service fee? Choose another card company they are not an honest.,5
Takes to long for the money I deposited‚Ä¶,I only use the card online but havent had any issues. I like how the money posts quickly and that it is easy to check my balance at any time.,1
Monthly fee ü§î,I can‚Äôt even use my card for online purchases,3
I'm happy thank u all,It's hard to get to a real person . please change that. Otherwise I'm okay with your services,3
It's Easy To Use Than a Credit Card,"I've had problems with identity theft and as it turns out I just looked at 12:27 am and someone has added their email address to my account which was supposed to be completely secure nobody has access to my name or anything at this point and yet I feel I'm about to lose a little bit I have left. Like a moron I gave gifts via Amazon's Google pay cards, I need someone to call me this Richie whatever 988 is obviously the same person who was Natasha and whatever it ended in-988 also. He charged a number or she whoever charge the number of Apple play cards gift cards whatever. I want that reversed I want that person prosecuted I want that person to have no access to anything that is mine and cannot understand for the life of me how in the world anybody could have that information to get in and play with my name and account when not a soul other than me knew I even made this move. Forget my angst, but I am severely disabled and they are telling me for the government that when I was in a coma that is where/when my identity was stolen.",4
I'm trying to use the mobile app to‚Ä¶,Great customer service and card is honored everywhere I go,5
Because my money was taken out of my‚Ä¶,I prefer Netspend over Chime any damn day,2
I like that NetSpend has many available‚Ä¶,I have called that's been many times about the $98 it was credited back to my account from Walmart it's still not showing up Walmart tells me they put it back in my account NetSpend you guys tell me that it's not there I have never had so much trouble with this bank and that $98 plus my $20 fee that you all charged me when it was put right back it just upsets me that you all take money from somebody and only get $700 a month I did not do that I reported it and stopped my card but you still put the $20 charge on me,1
Nice,Best bank ever,4
I love using net spend card,"I have mixed feelings about Netspend, because there are good aspects and bad aspects to using a Netspend Card. I like that it is an instant, easy process to transfer money from one Netspend cardholder to Netspend cardholder, which includes no fees. I do not like that there are fees to use your Netspend card, each time it is swiped, unless you join the monthly plan.",5
Well,Stop taking money from me every time I make a purchase.,5
Three words bad,"I used to love Netspend, but recently they started putting a hold on your Visa or Mastercard if you receive a refund from any establishment.  They will not notify you that there is a hold on your card either so you could be in a store and just get declined.  And it will last for hours unless you call them.  Then they will ask you why you got the refund and on what day you made the purchase...it's crazy!!  I am switching card companies because I get way too many refunds from Amazon to do this every time!",4
no problem finding loan site and using‚Ä¶,There isn't a way for me to check approximately what day my benefits arrive on the NetSpend app,1
Wonderful customer service,I definitely recommend this card to anyone new it decent,5
Perfect,My account was hit by a unauthorized charges had to get new card. Very disappointed,5
Netspend card is really convient and‚Ä¶,The Transaction fees are ridiculous its really not that serious,5
I am happy with service,I think your service is extremely excellent,5
Very good at making all transactions‚Ä¶,I can not get my card account transactions on line even after a customer service rep has helped me. Can't change my password won't let me go into my account for my card then it says it gives you a $10 safety fee that's a lie Iam -6.00 dollars on my card which makes no sense at all.,5
Great service,I got a Netspend card so when I have to use my credit cards or debit card online but net span just does not reach the customers I‚Äôm trying to pay so it‚Äôs pretty much useless to me except for Hulu Netflix sites like that,5

Great card in net spend in debit cards‚Ä¶,Easy to use.  Company has amazing customer service.,5
Riceway 2121,Netspend is definitely one of the better banking/credit/money apps that are available! I highly recommend it! I think this is the first banking app that didn't leave me confused or signing up for something I didn't want!,5
I have been VERY PLEASED with all the‚Ä¶,"I held a Netspend card for over 3 years, without a problem. A few months back my card needed renewal olaround my birthday. Even being a card holder for 3 years I was unable to pass their identity qualifications due to my soc. card not being legible! During Covid, most Asian offices were closed, making it near impossible to obtain a new card. But after 4 months I did get one finally, and Netspend picked up right where I left. I know my ID will not b compromised with netspend",5
Netspend is good..,I'm very happy with my NetSpend card is everything I need for my purchases and paying bills I will recommend NetSpend to all my family and friends thank you very much.,5
Charge too much just to spend your own‚Ä¶,I'm Kenya Edmonds and my problem is I have a old NetSpend card with money on it and I'm trying to transfer it to my new NetSpend card and I'm having a hard time doing it with a representative helping me I need someone to help me get the money off my old card and onto my new card,4
I love netspend because it is very‚Ä¶,"Offer to lend $100 no fees then charge double that? What a scam! I wanted this account because it looked so promising with the rewards features and virtual cards. I was super excited and dd my ctc payments and IRS funds to this account just to be let down and ended up owing almost 300 in fees the very first month. I am directly working on switching back to bank account through the credit union. My ""debts"" are paid with your company and as soon as I have a zero balance I will be requesting my account be closed. I wouldn't recommend this card to anyone. I am ashamed I believed the lies and even invited some people to open account  SMH, it may seem like a small amount, $300, but some of us single mamas depend on every single penny and now have to figure out where they can make that up.",1
Work just fine that's why I'm using it‚Ä¶,Great service. Love it!,5

Banker Bull$#!*!!,"The truth is, I have written several times hoping for an answer, but instead, I receive just another runaround response or another typical form letter on how it has nothing to do with Netspend. The other part of it is while I am on the chatline I get timed out if I don't provide a responce within a set period of time, sometimes in the middle of my responce. not everything can be explained in ten words or less, especially if you want a qualifying responce.",5
Easy to use and manage,"Three times in three year's I have tried in vain to obtain a cardand get it opened by your people.

Disappointed, the app can't handle it. I have to call each time. I asked for notice of balance on card to be texted to my phone. One card does that, not the other one. Don't have two NetSpend cards!!!!!       I will cancel one and find a different visa card carrier to handle the other card. Good luck with trying to use an outdated app.",5

Everything is pretty straight forward‚Ä¶,Very pleased with the ease of the use of the card great customer service the attention to detail on my account was amazing there were a couple of times where they observe a couple of purchases that didn't seem to be part of my spending habits and when they found out that they weren't mine they help me to correct the charges and be able to protect my account. Awesome job.,5
Service,You charge everytime the card is used your fees are ridiculous and then when you think you have a Premier card it's even worse!!! Your customer service is so unprofessional this is why I will be leaving net spend,4

About everything I did,"It's my first time having it, it's very good, I love it.",5
THE PEOPLE EMPLOYED AT THIS LOCATION ON‚Ä¶,"I am especially impressed with the bank overdraft feature and how efficient it works with no hassle. Because my wife is a flight attendant, and I travel a lot as well, either of us can have that particular card(I intend to apply for additional ones). She doesn't have to deal with not having the funds to cover her purchases, or being able to withdraw funds when she needs them. We recently started our own business and having those funds at that particular moment is important.",5
I love the service no complaints what‚Ä¶,"I like the way it keep up with what I put on the card. and the way it keep up with what I pay for,and the balance left.It's so much easy for me to keep up with.",2
To many fees!,It‚Äôs been past seven days and I still didn‚Äôt receive my money back on my card,5

This card has been working Great for me‚Ä¶,This is making Banking much simpler I feel secure with my finances in your bank I feel that it‚Äôs been a good choice to bank with you thank you.,5
All in all it took a lot to get,"So far so good. The only issue I have is that I have my Netspend card linked to my cash app but when my friend linked hers to her cash app it didn‚Äôt recognize it the same way as mine and it kept me from getting my referral bonus of $30. Then again I started using my Netspend because cashapp had let someone else get my card info and make multiple withdrawals and purchases without my authorization and they refused to do anything about it so iwont keep my money there but I will send money through them. I‚Äôm trusting you Netspend, don‚Äôt let me down.",5
I have had nothing but good experiences.,It is good and easy,5
I have no issues to report,This is the best by far no problems setting up and getting my payroll 2 day's early.,5
Netspend could offer more amount of an‚Ä¶,They were rude and you could barely understand them and poor phone quality,5
People I talked to were very‚Ä¶,I don't recall having contact with NetSpend for days,1
Takes a 1.50 away every transaction,These last two to three months that I have had NetSpend have been the most stressful months in my life of a debit card. When you buy the card just know that you're going to have to give them a copy of your driver's license of your birth certificate of your security your social security card. And when you buy the card don't put money on it until you have activated your card. It took me 2 weeks. And then if you get an email or a text that asked you if you made a charge you should not answer that email,4
Very helpful and patient.,Great job have a wonderful day thank you üíù,1
Happy,Everytime I call to get a representative to talk to all I get is press 0 and the star key and so I called social security and they got me back with direct express,5

I'll be a long time patron provided TMobile continues to provide exemplary service that I've yet to experience with any other phone service. The perks, and the value of services provided in each phone plan is worth the time to do due diligence comparisons to get the biggest bang for your buck. Thank you, and I'm grateful TMobile puts the satisfaction of their customers above the profit margin.",5
A good card for the most part,"Because I lived in one state and bought the card in another, the money I put on the card was only available after I jumped through multiple hoops. It was ridiculous. I'm still worried the money I put on that card won't be available, that there'll be a repeat of the nightmarish nonsense that went on when I first got it.",5
Very good and convenient,I have A NETSPEND ALL ACCESS CARD AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THE OVERDRAFT PROTECTION HAS BEEN ACTIVATED,4

Great service and never got to any‚Ä¶,Net Spend helps me keep track of what I spend and lets me have a direct deposit of my social security payments and it's easy to use and pay my bills with. I have some issues with some websites that wouldn't take the prepaid card. But it was nothing to do with Net Spend.,5

Never used NetSpend so I was a little‚Ä¶,Process was very easy!!,5
Everything was very fast and to the point. There was no confusion nor frustration on my end. Just wish the load fee wasn't so much. Every little bit matters on my part.,Didn't know yall charge 1.50 every cash app I send,5
Love it,I've had nothing but issues with Netspend and I'm always having trouble dealing with their call center.,5
So far so good üëç,I don't like that every time I use the card I'm being charged.,5
It is helpful  to my family  when  we‚Ä¶,I am charged 1.50 for every transaction I made when I pulled out at atm I was charge two fees,5
So far services seems to be efficient‚Ä¶,"Cannot get a hold of anyone by phone. Finally was approved for unemployment back pay and they were going to send it back. Too much money they said.  After 3 days of back and forth between netspend and state of wa they finally released my deposit of 16k. After that they upgraded me to ll access checking .. I have had more problems trying to use this card, I can't send western u ions and I can't transfer anything to another netspend card using the f k as pay system it says I e exceeded money out todqy.mits 7am spent the day in bed yesterday I havent spent anything at all.. more problems guess I will have to call in or I could go do anything else and it would be a better way to waste my time. Add in the system kicks your bum right out online by phone for nothing. If u have to call in maoe sure you have all your info in front of you you get 1 try 1 mistake and it hangs up on you. So don't use a device with delays, especially when dialing in numbers.. so wifi numbers like pinger do not use those its too difficult to enter into an automated system like this one that leaves nearly no room for error.",5
Took care me good,Lovelokhhhhhhhhhhhh,5
AWSOME customer service,Love getting my deposit on my card 2 days ahead of schedule. Just a great card to go though to get deposit,5

You are Greatüëç,They not good in no way no help and never understand your situation,4
You charge a $3 fee to reload the card,"Only issue I have is the fees. Although I do understand that they have to make money , it should not cost me five dollars to take out five dollars. The fee free atms are far from me , so I have to opt with the atm that has a cheap fee and it‚Äôs cheaper than Netspend. Netspend should not charge you to take out YOUR money! The monthly fee is ok for the maintenance of the card. Other than that it‚Äôs great!  Get rid of most of your fees and I‚Äôd recommend to anyone who wants it!",5
Terrible I‚Äôve been waiting for a month‚Ä¶,They charge to much for over drafting.taking 120 dollars from a single momdays before xmas . I cant wait to jan im changing,1

It has come in handy recently when I needed to use the funds for unexpected expenses, and realized I should sign up for the Premier so it's 5 bucks a month instead of 1.50 per transaction . I just didn't realize they take the 5 bucks out immediately. So, yeah, netspend is awesome if you never need help or have a question.",5

Fist time customer,Great card so far. Hoping for a long relationship with this company.,3
Review,The charges don't add up. I'll spend ten at a Gas station. It takes out 19.95. This happens a lot. I wait to see if it will get put back on my card. It never does. This adds up over time. 3 Here 5 there 8 here. They slowly rob you. Then there's no physical location to walk into to contest this. They've lost my business. They will no longer steal from me.,5
At the moment I don‚Äôt feel I have used‚Ä¶,I don't know I keep having the same problem .,5
I have had a few problems,Sent a transaction dispute and have received no communication on status or whether it's in the works just a disabling or the card. Also support number is all ads and no service.,4

Cuz you claim to have your customers or‚Ä¶,I‚Äôve been with netspend for years and I wouldn‚Äôt use any other debit card.,5
This is the best debit card I've ever‚Ä¶,So far I have tried mostly all the locations u have listed for your atm free withdrawal program which i am charged a fee for but all the locations are closed or no longer have an atm provided by your service.  It would b nice to have a updated list of locations and or a refund on the fee your company led me to believe that this included with this service.,1
Like My Wife,I gave it 2 stars because you can only take out 300$ as the daily limit at a ATM!!,5

Horrible,A good thing to get paid in advance 2 days early thank you so much NetSpend,5
A REALLY GOOD CARD BUT I DON'T LIKE THE‚Ä¶,Checks dont be on times like it use to when i first got with netspend,1
Excellent,I just feel like you guys shouldn‚Äôt take 1.50 from me Everytime,3
Horrible app,I‚Äôve been charged 2-3 times for the same thing on several different items,5
It's great,The overall service was excellent would recommend to friends and family,1
This card is not good,"I do not like the all access it has cost me more my ney !! I am very upset with it and I intend to cancel this account,,to go where?? I don't know!!  That's the problem!!",4
$1.50 fee for purchases are horrible,I am very satisfied. Direct deposit is awesome e. Thank you,1
This service makes me very unhappy,"My experience was horrible! I couldn‚Äôt file a dispute. Very disappointed with the associates. My card was blocked for 6 days. I couldn‚Äôt do anything! Kept getting promises that all would be taken care of in 24 hrs. Finally I asked for a supervisor or manager. Very,very nice man I don‚Äôt remember his name. He made me feel much better and listened and understood. I was given wrong information from the beginning. I am thinking about canceling my direct deposit because of what I went through. Too many charges on your end. I ended up paying for something I didn‚Äôt request. I feel all those charges at the ATM should have been waived. I was on the phone for 2 to 3 hours before I was helped. I would appreciate it if someone would follow up with me. Thanks",3
Excellent,Somehow my account had transactions made that had nothing to do with me and I was told it would be taken care of when I first called the cancel the card the car was replaced I called to find out the balance and it was still in the negative. So technically your company lied to me and now I have to have an investigation done which takes even longer to have my money put back. I will not be recommending you to anybody as your financial institution sucks. Have a nice day,1
Never had a problem and as easy to set‚Ä¶,I love that you text me immediately whenever a transaction is made. Helps me stay on top of things.,5
The Willingness and Attitude of the PERSON that UPLOADS your CARD..,It was received too late because of the COVID-19 pandemic. I thought I would have received unlimited data. Thanks,5
I don't understand why I have an‚Ä¶,My wife to be has been using Netspend for years and helped me to get my all excess card from Netspend. I love the ease of use. I can use it anywhere. I have set it up a couple of times to have contact with me showing me my balance and when I receive my SS Check. They always notify her when it arrives or when she does a purchase. I hope I get my money is little earlier since I am handicapped. I just got out of hospital from a stroke. Charles A Jones,4
To many fees,hell noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo,1
Keep charging fees after card was‚Ä¶,All the fees that I am charged to operate with NetSpend I should be allowed a $200 overdraft fee safety net the expenses for a $200 overdraft fee would be covered by the money made from me used in the card so it would cost the company no loss at worst they wouldn't profit but never lost,3
Grateful,Very Good. I have been using it for years.,1
Would be nice if the deposit limit‚Ä¶,I have been with netspend 8 yrs. I had a charge and disputed it and they took care of it and their cs reps are very friendly and helpful,5

I like netspend they great my family‚Ä¶,I‚Äôve had nothing but excellent service from Netspend,1
I love this card it helps you to‚Ä¶,It‚Äôs a shame that this car is supposed to help people make payments that can afford to get Debit Card and stuff but you charge ridiculous fees the load cards you charge ridiculous fees to use cards you‚Äôre just getting rich off the poor taking advantage of people that can‚Äôt afford to open a savings or bank account without the penalties of being charged every time they use it to make a payment,5
Netspend is a good way to bank and I‚Ä¶,Great all the way through everything I needed I found it in NetSpend I will recommend it to all my friends and family,5
I'll never use thisagain,Way outstanding...thank you for all that you do!,5

I love it,Never had a problem with my NetSpend the one thing don't like is every time I withdraw they always take out extra so if I take out $20 doll they charge me $6 each which I think is not fair at all..,5
NetSpend came in handy,Just got the card. No problems . ty,5
Good costumer service,"Considering that our two credit cards have a limit of $300 each, working with your security is extremely difficult.",5
I just love NetSpend,Someone stole my card,5
Not any problems,I didn't know there was a 5 dollar fee with the debit card. I didn't know you get charged one dollar for every debit card transaction. And I work for a hospital and my checks were band for doing camera deposits. This app is a little convenient but mostly shotty,5
Haven't had any issues so far,Great service from Netspend.  I love it.,4
"Dear Sirs,",I love that my direct deposit gets me paid early by two days.,5
Customer service rep was extremely‚Ä¶,"I am unhappy with the fees charged with every purchase, the hold of large sums upon getting gas until the charges cleared and the lack of fee free atm withdrawals.  Overall this is proving to be an expensive card to use.",2
The woman I spoke with was very‚Ä¶,"I would recommend NetSpend to anyone. I love it, I have 4 prepaid cards and they come in handy, I am very satisfied with this service",5
I never leave home without it,I just started and it's been a great experience so far,1
I don't have much to say except the‚Ä¶,a dollar fifty charge every time I used to have to use the f**king card is bs and not okay like I'm spending more money and fees then I'm actually actually spending in cash is ridiculous,5
Satisfaction,Always accepted on legitimate sites and stores. Love that I get texts after EVERY purchase.,3
Yall have been very helpful with my‚Ä¶,I love it ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.,5
Awesome card,"""Hello"" so far this service seems to be great. I love that I can add funds on this card and save. Times are hard for me right now and this card works well for me. I just want to continue to save and be able to purchase Items when I able to do so.",5

I really enjoy use useing my card it's‚Ä¶,Thank you so much and I much-needed time it was much easier to do,2
I've been with this company for years‚Ä¶,"Service with customer service was good. I was happy that I was able to understand him. Majority of times there English is poor, I  wanted to talk to a supervisor to ask whomever a question of something that is new to me. There not able to get one on the line ever. So I might have to go to another company if nobody wants to speak to me that would help me.",5
I love this card,I Love This Money App It Comes And Handy Very Well And Excellent services I just have gotten my provisnal credit I Requested but the Bank is Amazing,5
This card is trash,I don't like having to spend money to spend money.,5
Useful,"I thought it was a great idea, but I was wrong!! I'll make sure I read the fine print. Taking a 1.50 for every trans action is horrible. When I use it to pay bills or send money to loved ones and they don't get it but it was taken out. Then I have to wait months to get it back mean while I get late charges and my son goes without hygiene and food. And to top it off customer service was rude.    Misty Roby",1
They helped me alit with my bebit card greatly,The card works well and is convenient to load at Walgreens.,5
Would like cards with chip in them,Love the way to keep her eye on your account let you know what's going on such a friendly group of people designed to help you to the fullest thank you.,5

Awesome app,"I feel that it's very convenient, there aren't any hidden fees. Everything is upfront. Your transactions are always available to see, and they also alert you of your spending by text. They're also available if you need help, via customer service.",2
Very Satisfied.,Phone service sucks. Too long to hear my balance. Too many prompts,5
This is the best bank I have ever used,I disputed a matter an I got a letter in the mail stating that my money $2995 will be put back on my card an am still waiting for it an customer service didn't help me with my matter at all I need it to be solve,5

I never got my problem resolved they‚Ä¶,My direct deposit was received on the 1st they had to send me 3 different cards so I didn't have access to my money and got charged a service fee üòê,5
Have not used it enough to form an‚Ä¶,I needed a prepaid debit card and Netspend got me what I needed. This is a way for people like me to have a Visa Debit card without jumping through the banks hoops.,1
Should not have to pay everytime I use‚Ä¶,I appreciate everything you guys help me with,4
Based on just 1 thing,"Very easy to set up my account for direct deposit, I get my check 2 days early which is awesome, I love netspend, way better than sitting in line at the bank.",2
Fees are WAY TO HIGH,"Thank you for catching the fraud  and to show that I am a valued customer you freeze my money and close my account leaving me twisting in the wind. Let's not punish the POS that hacked a 2 month old card , let's screw the customer",1
Good product but too many fees,I don't like using the card I have to pay just to get my own money that I borrowed off it it had to pay so much back in interest,1
I love Netspend.,"I've been with Net spend a few years now I've had a few ups and downs, but overall I like Netspend. Except the pressure of direct deposit. I have emailed and messaged more than once that I am self employed I don't have a weekly check. Besides I like to see the money that I work hard for before someone else does.im content the way it is thank you and have a blessed evening",3
Please make it cash app approved,"your company lacks customer service. Not sure how someone's dispute could not be granted when funds were clearly removed from my account while I was incapacitated by covid 19 for 40 days (during the time when the majority of the transactions occurred. I was in the ICU. No family or friends could visit, I could not leave the hospital, I could not walk. I even told the first agent my personal items including my card went missing. Your company assumed I was able to leave the hospital and make these transactions. I even offered to send my hospital records showing I was in the hospital. They say they want to help and they are sorry I went through that with covid. I lost everything my mother, my job, my car, my last paycheck that was directly deposited to that account and you guys say the charges were ok? there was a charge that was done at an atm in Feb 2021. Again I was still in the hospital!",5

I enjoy using my net Speed the deposit‚Ä¶,You charge way too much,5
Satisfied overall,I requested a new card with my name printed on it. It took almost 10 minutes to answer the multiple questions the lady was asking. When my card finally arrived my name isn't even spelt right. I am unable to even use the card.,5

I pretty much like everything about this bank/card.,I absolutely love NetSpend. The fact that I was upgraded to the new All-Access NetSpend card shows that I'm cared for as a customer. I've even went as far as to recommend NetSpend to my manager. The customer service is the BEST.,4
Thank you,My routing number or account number doesn't work so I can't use my card to pay any bills,5
Terrible experience,I have been using Netspend for about 10 years and I have no complaints.  Very awesome card.,4

I supposed to give it 5 stars,"the app would not work properly and I could not use the card this weekend like I needed too.  Most upsetting and embarrassing for me as well,",1
This banking is generally good wish the‚Ä¶,I can't get into my account and I want to know where my card is that was supposed to be resent,4
It's been a good service,"Not s good card. Half my purchases get rejected, NetSpend blames the vendor.Customer service are all barely proficient in English.",4
"Timely,concise instructions",Yeah I‚Äôve had Netspend for a while had different cards I‚Äôve had all every single color of the cards blue gold pink black Visa MasterCard and now I have a Visa prepaid debit card and I‚Äôll love them so much they are the best company to have and get a debit card prepaid debit card through them and also Metabank even though the two places are in two different places Netspend is in Austin Texas but meta-bank is in South Dakota so if you are looking to get a prepaid debit card go with Netspend and then arrange to get online access any time alerts the whole works in our checking account savings account and all excess online banking you are in good hands with Netspend they work with you and you were with them to protect your identity and your money to track your money control your money spending,5
I‚Äôve had no problem with NetSpend ever‚Ä¶,Transactions that I didn't spend keep popping up on my card an its frustrating an Noone will help,5
I think it's great thanks y'all,Goodness is all we need to get by each and every day.,5
Worst prepaid debit card and app,I am giving them 1 star but if it was up to me they wouldn't be getting any stars they allowed someone to access my account take my money put me in overdraft then netspend took my money that was direct deposited into my account after that to pay for what some stranger did when they decided to break in to all the mailboxes in my building they promised an investigation and for 2 months now I haven't heard back anything if I could give them zero stars I honestly would,5
Trusted Company,The 1.50 charge every time I use my debit card is going to make me move my money!  I don‚Äôt like carrying cash so I use my card a lot and the 1.50 charge every time I use my card is more than my account fee charge at my bank. I think I am going to have to change my direct deposit back to my bank account!,1
They let ppl hack into ur account and‚Ä¶,Can‚Äôt get anyone on the phone for questioning and also by only allowing $300 per atm transaction by charging lots of fee‚Äôs are not fair not to mention each other transaction also has fee‚Äôs.,5
I‚Äôve had a few difficulties and I can‚Ä¶,Netspend has truly been a blessing . I get my check  two days before anyone ells .I am able to use one card for all my shopping Needs and when I do run into a problem they have very patient tech personal always ready to help. I swear by it and will always use and Rockland it,1
I am happy with how nice and wonderful‚Ä¶,"You failed to notify me when you placed a temporary hold on my card due to suspicion of fraudulent activity- which you were correct about & did catch.HOWEVER, you didn't try to call, text or email me to notify me of this hold.I didn't find out until I tried to use my card & it declined on me.  This is VERY DISTURBING to me because it could have been a serious emergency that required me to use my card!!!  Also, unfortunately you have not been so proactive or vigilant in catching fraudulent previous unauthorized purchases in the past.  You have even let some go through when my account was in the negative already & then you charged me an NSF Fee on top of it!!  Then it takes 3 months or more for you to investigate said charges & have even been wrong in crediting my account back, when I didn't even authorize the transactions!!! I currently have 2 accounts with you because of this & 1 you are STILL investigating!!!!  This really makes my life incredibly difficult especially since I am not a millionaire, it's a HUGE hit to take & then in some cases you determined the charges were legitimate when in fact they were NOT!!!!!!!!  One of my accounts is in the negative for about $160.00 because of your faulty so called investigations & it will stay that way until you all correct it.  I refuse to put another red cent into that account!!!!!!  Also the wait times are ridiculous & your staff is very hard to put up with & communicate with!!  Does anyone who works for Netspend speak the English language clearly or is a TRUE native of this country???????  I am over this so called company!!Christy Combs162 Rosin CtWilmington NC 28405910-746-7513- my new cell number effective 12/5!!!  It replaces my number that was originally 910-795-3341Is this enough information for you to verify who this is????  Or do you require my great grandfather's date of birth????????",5
Love Netspend,"This bank is awesome, I love how you can receive notifications on when your card has been used and it tell how much was spent. It's very convenient and you can set up a savings account to put money away for emergency.",5

Well this is my first time using nextflix and it did me well everything is on it when I needed it give you 5 stars,"I have had my share of compromised accounts (√ó3), but Meta Bank or Netspend has made good on those accounts.  I received a new card lastly on my old account.  However the direct deposit was placed in an old account.  I should have $100 in savings now in that old account.  SSA sent a letter saying it should be this next check should go into the newest account.  I prayerfully hope so.  Otherwise Netspend has been great and I've had them for years. I'm not going to leave them as long as I don't have another compromised account.  The security should be able to prevent those type of incidents from happening.  I hope so......Theresa Taylor",3
So far so good but said my refund would‚Ä¶,"I bought the Netspend card to give to my fianc√©e, he is in the military and could not use it in that country so I used it for myself",5

Great service,Been consistant n legit to the with word,1
I have never had any issues with my‚Ä¶,"I am totally irate that I have been scammed by this company an after my money is off this card I will never use them again they have been charging me $2 every single time I purchase anything with that card an theu received over $3000 in deposits in under a month. Now when they set this up they never mentioned that thru enough charge these kinds of rates over every little thing purchased so I pay to add money, I pay to use my money, an I pay to transfer money so what exactly is the benefit yo putting over three thousand into this company none.  So I will stick with chime an be happy to not use them after the last if my money is off this card cause their customer service stinks was left on hold for over a hour waiting fir someone eho was a supervisor an never did I get one an just for the record I know full well since I telemarketer that they don't have supervisors in every single pod station, so that was some really crappy assistance.  Then they did answer they were not able to do anything an refused to give me the almost hundred bucks they stole from me. So take my advice an do not use them. They will lie an cheat you out of your money an offer you no assistance. Their is not anyway they are at all to the customers benefit an do not resolve any conflicts that the customer has an fir the money they charge you your better off with company like Chime.",5
I love my NetSpend card..,Hi account number is and hacked,5
Thank you for ur product,"I wanted a way to move trust monies, but sadly, no line for the trust or company under the name. I'd like Premier to activate on a $500 dollar load as well, as the ACH didn't work to direct deposit funds. The website could be more intuitive, but for most it is easy to use and has good features for online shopping.",5
Good review,"Love you guys!!  ""MERRY CHRISTMAS"" You've saved me so many times from getting my bank account hacked and my $ gone.",4
If there wasnt so many fees to pay you‚Ä¶,I really like the card and the services are great,5
If I could give it a zero I would I‚Ä¶,"My card was used unauthorized on a Monday and I called to get a new card. The gentleman that waited in me didn't bother to order me a card. So when the end of my 3 business days came(Friday)...no card. So I called to see why and that is when I discovered he hadn't ordered one. That was on Friday, now I am waiting til Wednesday for a card. So 10 days without a card. So glad I hadn't switched my SS check over to be direct deposited. Won't be now for sure. When I get my new card I will withdraw my money and close my account. I really couldn't recommend you to anyone. Very disappointed.",4

Convenient,You are a Great Value to me. I like your app and Business. You have helped me obtain a goal. Which is cool.,5
Everything i need to do on one card‚Ä¶,While other brick and morter banks only goal is to overdraft the life out of you.This one does not.Just don't go to an ATM to check balances as it will cost you .50 .The only other thing I can say is that places like Robin hood do not accept this bank as payment for buying stocks.There reason is that it's not a brick and morter like the big banks.Too bad it's their loss.,5
