Conner Hathaway,"I called because I needed to figure out an issue with logging in. The man I spoke with was extremely helpful, and efficient. He was able to quickly send a new email, and problem was solved in under 5 minutes. It's always refreshing talking to someone who is a competent helper. Much appreciated."
ALEXANDER EDMONDS,"You can improve by not being greedy as heck. My old company transferred my account to you without my knowledge,  i applied for a roll over immediately and you are charging me 25 $ to send my money where i need it. Ridiculous."
TIMOTHY ZITTEL,"This investment company has the worst fee's possible. I was charged 10 dollars a statement i never received. If your looking to retire through IRA account, steer clear of these guys. Customer service was great though..😂.."
FCM,My money was put into you your trust without my permission. You charge me to put it into and to take it out. It is a very small sum as your funds go with no interest earned. Tell me why I should be a happy camper with your organization. You people are a bunch of Shysters.
Landon,"Customer service has been very informative and helpful. Old company I worked for transfered my account into Millennium Trust after a few years of not working there. The one downside I experienced is the lengthy processing time of withdrawing your funds, wasn't expecting to have a 10+ day delay so I could move my funds to my portfolio. Other than that the short experience with them was good."
Yvette,It  took numerous attempts to connect with a live agent and not a chat bot.  I was interested in knowing how long a distribution takes.  A suggestion for the future would be to add a time frame to any  correspondence.  Why does it take 15 business days to push buttons for an ACH transaction is a question that i have.
NANCI DONACKI-THOMPSON,"My 401K from my old job was trasfer  here before I even had a chance to deal with the 401K. The amount was $2226 dollars and I was charged $25 to close the account. All I wanted was my mo ey, but you had me jumping through so many hoops just to get it, you might as well keep all of it."
ALLEN WILSON,"Overall service was horrible, no money was invested and only fees were taken for no real reason.  Worst banking and investment company I have ever dealt with and I use T. Rowe Price, Charles Schwab, Fidelity and USAA.  HorribleAdded - yes, I understand the regulations but the $10 cash sweep fee for pennies quarterly, $25 annual fee, closing fee and no investment of any kind…again, just fees until it dwindles away.  Shame on my previous employer for not just cutting a check and sending it to me."
CYNTHIA FORD COREY,"Lisa was wonderful.  She didn't just give directions, she went through the process step by step until completion.  She should be commended for her knowledge and patience."
WILLIAM HARRIS SR,I am a new customer in past couple of weeks.   I set-up and account on-line.   A couple of days later I had change phone number and tried to get back into the account.   I was not able to get back into account because MT wanted to send text to my old phone number.   I called and MT said they would will change it.   I took four days and and four calls and each time they said they need to put work order to take care of it.  All people were nice but didn't solve problem.Not a good start for MT.   Hope it gets better
Kelly G,"Luis at the help center was FANTASTIC.  He listened to my issue, explained how to solve the problem, and took the steps to do so, all while I was on the line.  And it only took a few minutes."
EDWARD SILVIA,"Terri was my CSR - she was polite, professional, helpful and informative. While in the first 3 minutes of the call we were disconnected - she promptly called me back to finish our conversation. Stellar customer service!!!"
YK.,"I have been attempting to register my account with Millennium Trust for months now, and every step has led to more confusion and misunderstanding. While the associates on the phone are very friendly, every form I submitted was responded to with a phone call telling me I missed a step I had never even known about. Overall communication regarding what should have been a simple process was extremely lacking."
Bailey Kent,"I needed to verify a second account to view its balance online.  There is no self service option for this in the portal, my wait time for a representative was approximately 30 minutes, far too long.   The representative I spoke with was friendly, but sounded exhausted and overwhelmed.    It seemed like your call center was not adequately staffed."
LOLITA W,"Your Representatives are always very pleasant, helpful and professional.  They provide adequate assistance for my requests and questions.  *My only issue is with the automated answering, it takes too long to follow the prompts and get to a live person."
NICHOLE PETE,"Worse experience. The fact that I had to hunt this account down after you all received it from Mass Mutual/empowered. Then the fact that you really made me validate an online account only transfer the funds is ridiculous. The fact that you are requesting a document, the rep couldn’t do it over the phone is ridiculous. Almost like you are trying to make it difficult for me to withdrawal the funds. I literally transferred 3 other 401k older this one each were done over the phone and we’re easy!! All but this one."
JILL SANDERS,"She was quiet.  Not enthusiastic about helping me with the process.  When the phone got disconnected, she did not return my call.  I was mortified!!!"
TIMOTHY RIVERA,"Millennium trust is a well traversed establishment where safety precautions are key priorities, the representatives are very informative and helpful, my only negative comment is the wait period in receiving your withdrawal account has been a week after all information has been processed."
GUADALUPE VAZQUEZ,I’m very grateful for the agent that assisted me on Monday the 10thShe was very helpful and patient with me she even waited while I found the information and spend extra time with meThank you again
JOSEPH SMALLEY,Lost my card that loaded with funds from a previous employer. I then found it it was expired.O NO! Looked you guys up on line. Called and you were great help.A replacement card was sent in thought seven business days. Thank You
Melissa,I had to make an early withdrawal from my 401K and the website and customer service during the process were both seamless.  I received my funds quickly and received electronic communication confirming each step along the way.
Irene Tisworth,"Previous attempts I tried to do this, but today it was easy I took my time and read all the material. The material is a.little intimidating but it is thorough."
ALVARO SANCHEZ,"I was very pleased with your company the transaction was very easy and fast to complete. The application itself is very customer friendly as it is informative and guides you through the whole process. Plus, the deposit went through by in the next day as you stated it would take between 1 and 2 days. THANK YOU."
JUSTIN BANISTER,"It was a little difficult from the Website to learn how to initiate a rollover for another institution but once I spoke with a rep(Jaqueline, I think is how it’s spelled) she pointed me in the right direction"
Chris Rockett,I didn't get involved with this company voluntarily. I don't like the $35 fee they charged instantly when my money was moved over to them against my will.
MARK MOESCH,"I called and was on hold for about 10 seconds then a pleasant person walked me through my issue and followed up with an email.  Simple, fast and pleasant"
Chrisopher,it was easy to start the rollover process but it forces me to select an employer plan and I have an IRA with another investment team so it is confusing
REGINALD ALLEN,Good service all around it was easy to access online to receive my funds and I call yesterday the lady that help me was 100% helpful and nice and she made sure I know what I was doing before we got off the phone hats off to her
SUSAN WALDMAN,I called to let a representative know that the incorrect amount was withheld from my RMD check.  The rep stated she would look into the matter & get back to me.  I still have NOT heard back from anyone at Millennium Trust!
ALESIA PERRY,"I thought the representative was courteous, listened carefully to my questions and provided clear and concise instructions on how to achieve the actions I requested"
MARK PAGUYO,"I give 5 stars because the representative helps me and guide me what im going to do in order to get my refund, thank you very much Millenium Trust! God bless."
Veronica A.,Just amazing customer service from the rep that assisted me she walked me through it all and was super patient with me.
ERIC SKEETERS,The MT Online service was awful. I repeatedly got generic emails regarding withdrawals from my account and its been weeks trying to complete my transaction
KAREN SANTIAGOVAZQUEZ,It helped me figure out what I was missing and how to fix it and how to get on line so I can keep up with my account.
ARTHUR FLESHMAN,"I was informed that my previous employer had rolled over my retirement once I left,I contacted millennium trust and they helped me quickly through there website, I had many options to invest my money"
VALERIE GEORGE,The customer service was very helpful and really patient with me and she helped me through the problem I was having.
STEPHANIE CRABTREE,I’m not sure what to say other than you want a review and I’ve not received my money. Maybe next time ask for a review after someone gets their money.
CHRISTOPHER FRENCH,Filling out this review as requested in response to a total distribution. Process was straight forward and quick.
MINON MINNIEWEATHER,Very easy to navigate through the website and calling customer service was a great idea. The representative was kind helpful and patient and down to earth thank you
CHRISTINE BAILEY,Lady that spoke with me was very rude. She said she couldn’t hear me so I looked at my phone to make sure I wasn’t on speaker an when I put the phone back to my ear an said I don’t know why she said well you must of done something cause I can hear you fine now with an attitude. I literally pulled the phone away from my head an looked at my phone an put the phone back to my head. I don’t appreciate the attitude an being called a lier.
Sasha,Spoke with a representative that was extremely rude and unprofessional. She told me I was entering my name incorrectly because they have my last name as Lee Shelby. I stated that was not my name and she cut me off and asked if I “still need help or can she disconnect?”
Karl Decker,I have had to fill out the forms multiple times.Difficult to reach a real person.  Real person tells you you have to fill out the forms.I just want access to my account!**Update**. Pauline from customer service did reach out to me and apologized for the poor service.  She offered to help me out with any concerns.
KIMBERLY W,"POORI recently experienced a windfall...I'm trying to withdraw out of my IRA and the wait is ridiculous. I'm transferring my IRA to another institution! I understand I am not the only person they deal with, but I need to have prompter service."
LATRAVIA PETERS,Takes extremely long to send money and never have up to date information it’s such a hassle to receive my own money
robert davis,Great customer service department the website for me gets confusing in some areas and when i needed help they were there every step of the way and extremely patient
LATONYA BENOIT,Well I can't remember the customer service person's name anymore but she was so helpful to me.i even asked her was there a survey she did reply and said yes I may and may not get one.im so excited you guys did.i hope you can pull her name up that helped me.thank you
MARISSA DAY,Information that was given was all over the place and I was told that I was contacted numerous times about a low balance that I never was contacted about and then I was told your company kept my balance for low balance fees .  Not satisfied with the service either.
Vonda Harris-Cade,I was very pleased with the help I received from the agent at Millennial Trust also pleasantly surprised by the follow up phone call from her as well. Great job!
MICHELLE HELLER,I still would like to know where i can go look for my documents to be sent out if i have a tracking ## but see nothing were ut says tracking
TODD BITTER,The customer service representative was amazing. The automated system was not able to help me with what I needed. But the customer service representative what above and beyond was very friendly and cheerful highly recommend the services.
TAKYA BROWNING,I am trying to go back and find where I can view my account and the request but am unable to find my way without calling into the customer service line.
TAYLOR LINDE,Awful Process!  Person I spoke with was helpful.  Horrible process that I can’t handle my accounts at the same time.
KENNETH MURRAY,Had to get my withdrawl but the card they provide becauee they don't except any mobile banking account.
MAYO,"I did not get a notification that my 401K had been transferred to Millennium Trust. I had to call Empower Retirement to get that information. The company then gave me a long form to fill out to get it transferred. It was very inconvenient so I decided to delay the process.Fast forward two years, I am on the website with the intent to transfer my account to Mutual Of America and I discover Millennium Trust has been charging me an annual fee and statement fee for my account. I NEVER got a statement because they had my address wrong and never notified me of an annual fee. They were just taking money from me with no regard or guilt. Scam artists — be ashamed of yourselves."
Anubhav Kanotra,Great experience with Millennium Trust. Kept my money safe and the withdrawal process was very simple and quick. Highly recommend!
TABITHA TAYLOR,"This is not my 1st IRA account. But is 1st last and only account this group will hold of mine ever. The methods and effort it  takes to access one's account online is extreme and excessively unnecessary. I suppose it is successful effort on their part to hold onto my money for their gain while they do nothing to improve my balance. Only transactions have been annual deduction of fees, period. Further, I have not received any sort of contact or update from this group via mail, email, nor phone since DEC 2020.This account was opened in early 2019. Just knowing the annual fee plus the 'closing of the account fee' will further deplete my funds, makes me both angry and sick."
Bonnie  Hudon,"The agent, Donna, that assisted me was very helpful, polite and professional. I wasn’t aware I even had this IRA."
SUSAN SAMPSON,Person I spoke to was short and I felt I was a disruption and inconvenience to her with my request
MARY MEEKS,The people all knew what they were talking about and were so friendly easy to talk to
JULIANNA WALO,I love the direct deposit option as many companies make it difficult to distribute from accounts. Definitely want to use this company in the future. Plus customer service representative was extremely helpful.
DIANE WEST,They did not question me  a lot just knew I was going through hard times and needed to cash out.
MATTHEW HONEYCUTT,Well i requested a paper request for funds almost 2 months ago...still waiting.. Finally got the online working...and card/check is in the mail.i guess we will see what happens in the next few days.
JESSICA BROZ,"Easy to use system. I didn't even know that an account had been transferred, but they tracked me down and made sure I had the information that I needed to take care of everything. I appreciate that!"
JOEY V GARCIA,"It was a really fast transaction, geez 6 years ago it was worth more than half as much as I had. But yea very quick & easy. Thank you"
JEANNE WILLIAMS,"Although confusing at first, process was walked through by customer representative  and she made it easy"
AARON,"My 401k got vacated and moved to MT, didnt know that had happened.Was put into a money market account and had less money in their that when I made my last deposit 8 years ago. Poor growth even though we have had the losses in the market. Had to provide old address to prove it was me but being that I have had 3 addresses since then hard to prove witch one, and they cant tell you what one matches of course. Many more documents sent and rejected for wrong address a quick 2-3 weeks later and several phone calls and waiting periods. I now have access to an online account. And you can only do rollovers if you have your online account set up. One thing after another, by far one of the more difficult places I have dealt with for simple things. Hope you dont get stuck with them👍"
JAMES CHAVIS,They were very easy to work with. Did of did a great job of staying in touch with me over the years. did everything with very little effort
MICHAEL HARGADON,Somewhat intuitive forms. Just didn't get a definitive answer if my request went through

RICHARD BRAWLEY,"The lady that helped me was very professional and knowledgeable, and had a great attitude."
TAMIKA BRAY,I didn’t ask to be in here this is a place that wants to take funds not grow and they want to profit
PATRICIA LONERGAN,"My money was sent to Millennium Trust from MetLife.   Was never told the money was being sent there.   I call  Millennium Trust and the agent was friendly. She explained that it would be a few days before my money would show in the system.   I looked almost every day to see if my money was in there because I wanted to originally take it from MetLife.   It finally shows up in the Millennium Trust account and to my utter surprise,  they charged me s $35 annual fee on the same day my money finally showed in the system.    Charging me an annual fee when my money just went over!!!   I sent an email and asked for a callback from someone, but only received a call back after I made another call and sent the email.  I was not a happy person.   I called back two days ago and asked to have the fee charge reversed.   Does not show anything about that.   Not happy.   I will never do business with them again.   The agent I spoke to was friendly, no complaints with the two or three people I spoke with.  After doing this review and a few phone calls,  my $35 was returned.  However, they charged me a $10 fee when I requested a disbursement.   So they returned my $35 but charged me a $10 fee in order for me to take my money out so they still made money from me.   At this point, I was just glad to get my funds from them."
MATTHEW GRIFFITH,"The experience was good, my company rolled over my 401k to Millennium Trust without me knowing, it was very easy to request a withdrawal and close the account. Thanks"

Kendra K,"This was the most polite, helpful, and informative representative I’ve ever spoke to. Thank you."
Anonymous ex-Client,"We transferred an IRA from Millennium to another provider. The experience was complicated and non-intuitive, and took 3 weeks from the date that the other provider submitted the transfer paperwork directly to Millennium. The other provider does not charge any of the fees that Millennium charges, including annual account maintenance (even if funds remain uninvested in a money market acct) and transfer related fees. The website was not very intuitive, especially when the transfer already occurred, there was no notification about this of any kind, online or via email (we had to call to confirm transfer status). The website kept looping to same page with no explanation why account access was not possible. The tier 1 customer support via phone was repeatedly rude. She did not allow asking clarifying questions, and instead transferred us with no explanation, putting on a 10 minute hold. Tier 2 customer support was a different story, knowledgeable and courteous. Terrible training and low standards for Tier 1 are a show stopper. Unfortunately, as a result of these experiences, Millennium falls far short of competition and I will never again use or recommend them. Much room for improvement."
PAUL CLEARY,The webisite could be a little more user friendly.  Customer service rep was extremely helpful.

CARINA RAMIREZ,Representative was quick to answer.  Courteous and friendly.  She took the time with me.
CASEY TANNER,"Very easy, informative."
GEROLD LINGLE,"I was stuck with them when my account was transferred without my knowledge from TIAA. Millenium had no record of me for weeks, even though the money was transferred electronically. Finally, after about 3 weeks and many pointless phone calls, they informed me that they found the transfer, but were missing some information, so were waiting on TIAA to get that to them. Finally, after a month, I was able to open an account. Had to pay a $35 fee for starters, which sucked. Then trades cost $8/each. I haven't paid for a stock trade in years! So that sucks. First stock purchase went through, but got an error message on second one. Something like ""could not execute trade. Ambiguous something..."" So I tried to trade again. Same error. I tried a third time, and only then, after more poking around, did I realize that hey... the trades had gone through. Dang. So multiple of the same trade at $8/pop. Ridiculous. Oh well, I figured I'd eat it. Next disappointment came the following day, when I tried to set up dividend reinvestment. Couldn't find any way to do that on the website. So I called in, and after some checking with others, the agent informed me that they don't do dividend reinvestment for stocks or ETF's, just for mutual funds. What garbage! So I'd need to manually come in every month and make a purchase (with a big trading fee!). Forget that. I decided to switch this Roth IRA over to Fidelity, which doesn't have crazy excess fees, doesn't lose my money for a month, actually does dividend reinvestment (DRIP) easily right on their webpage, etc, etc, etc. A far superior company. Every other brokerage I've used (TIAA, Transunion, Sofi, Etrade, etc, ) are all VASTLY better than Millenium Trust in every way I can imagine. I'll be happy when my Roth is out of Millennium's control, and I can stop the bleeding. Goodbye and good riddance!!!"
KEISHA,It was a pleasure
PAUL HARVEY,Stephanie was incredibly helpful in guiding me through the self-directed IRA account opening process and the process to deposit a rollover check into that account as well as move a Millennium-custodied rollover IRA into the newly created self-directed IRA account. Complicated stuff made simple!
ALEXANDRA DOS SANTOS,"The Rep was very helpful, patient and pleasant to chat with."
SARA C,"the customer service was great , agent didn't give me hard time and help me what I need in a short phone call."
KATUSKA BARBERY,I spoke with 2 representatives this afternoon and they were both amazing! Unfortunately I don't recall their names but I have talked about my experience with them twice already today. They both helped me with such ease and my call was completed successfully. I totally appreciate their customer service they provided today because I was not looking forward to everything I had to do today to update things.
John Eife,I moved my funds to my bank account and it was very easy.
HUONG TRAN,So far ok. Waiting on welcome email to get access to my account

JAMANIE PAYNE,Was easily able to gain access to my account.
CHERYL GREEN,My advisor was very patient with me as I accessed my account and was very helpful in me doing so.
TARA AVERY,the online verification process is subpar to say the least ..it has some issues with safari users according to the rep I spoke to. Fidelity on the other hand handle the same thing in less than 3 minutes for a rollover. I'll be waiting for an email to confirm my login verification..
BRIAN WATSON,good job thank you
JASON EBERT,Lack of hands on help. My old employer I haven't work for in a year and a half out of nowhere sends more money after I already had closed the account and instead of it goin to my bank account I have to do all these extra steps and get charged all the fees once again for a low amount the old employer sent.
JAMES DIXON,Awesome Service. Quick and easy. Love this company.
EDMOND COSTIN JR,Excellent customer experience.  Agent was pleasant and used my name multiple times to thank me.  Fielded several questions and provided detailed answers after some light hold time for look-ups and to ensure answers were accurate.  Followed up with a form that was sent while I was still on the call to ensure I had received it.  Excellent and efficient call overall.
Kathy Dupriest,"The representative was willing to assist on two questions, solved in less than 5 mins, pleasant phone attitude and I hung up my phone informed and feeling i knew what i was finally doing"

DIANE HOYT,I had a good experience the agent I work with was so helpful guiding me through the process.
ZULMA HERNANDEZ GONZALEZ,Veronica from Alabama is the one who answered my call. I asked her if how long will it take to process my account withdrawal and she said it will take 5-10 business days. I also asked her if I needed more documents and she said the company will contact me if ever. She is really helpful and jolly throughout the entire conversation.
TATIANA PITTS,Great customer service
Ana Morales,Glad they were able to help so I can take my 401k

ALEXANDER CECIL,Other than accessing my account the service was very fast.
ARLENE PANTOJA,"Millennium Trust accepted money from my 401k in error, I wanted T. Rowe Price to send it directly to me. But, I had to go through Millennium trust to get it back. I then had to pay a fee to get my own money back and close an account that I never consented to opening."

SHERMAN TERRY,"I received email asking me to call at a number. I called, they collected all my private data, ssn, previous address, date of birth. Then transferred me to a guy in India who said I need to update my online account. I feel I was scammed - they do have my recent address, I receive ads in my paper mail from them. Interaction made me very worried."
JAO,They were responsive and quickly provided me the answers I was looking for so I could get on with my day.
Ni Cou,I have always had an open and clear conversation with my finance with any member from the customer service team. I'm from Spain and part of the procedure was new to me. They have led me through each step with patience.

LORRIEANN KATSHEN,"Called because my employer rolled over my 401k to Millennium.  I was informed that I had to do everything online that she couldn’t even assist with a withdrawal.  Now I am dealing with a continuous circle.  The online verification process says my email is verified but when I try to login it keeps taking me back saying I need to enter the verification number.  Not an enjoyable experience.  This started 10/7 then I worked on it again 10/10.  I was also informed I could login on my phone but it states in the email that a laptop or desktop is preferable.  This is not compatible with phone at all, a laptop or desktop should be used."
TAYLOR VONDERHEIDE,David was very polite and helpful.  Was able to assist in a timely manner and assisted with my questions.
MATTHEW HENRICH,I totally forgot the young man name but he has excellent customer service & very detailed!!! Thank you

ALEXANDRIA GREEN,I have used Millennium Trust as custodian for my self-directed IRAs (Traditional and Roth) for the last 7 years.  They have efficiently handled dozens of commercial real estate transactions and have always been there to provide any assistance I required.  I have never had a negative experience with them.  I would certainly recommend their services to anyone who wishes to invest IRA funds in non-traditional assets.

Toni,"My 401a was transferred to your company without my knowledge or consent. You chose to ""welcome"" me to your company by using an home address from an employer who I stopped working for 8 years ago. You took $60 in fees without my consent. In order to get my funds transferred back to my fidelity portfolio I need a statement - which are produced only annually?!"
TALLON CLARK,Excellent experience definitely will be opening other account with my other job.
HELEN RAMOS,Account was transferred over to them. No notification that they are the account holder from prior 401k. Then get a charge of $25 for them having my money. Then to close the account is another charge by them.

JANETTE CRUM,"I never received confirmation emails so I had to continuously call to know if my money was received, my account was setup, etc.  Your fees are too high. I already setup a transfer to vanguard and I can’t get my money out of your organization fast enough.  AND you are making that process painfully slow too.  Basically, your organization sucks!"
TIMOTHY ZVONIK,"My company from years ago transferred my 401k money to Millennium. My experience finding it, setting up an account and withdrawing it was fast and easy. I’m hopefully buying. New home soon and this money will help me get closer to closing out the sale."
KELLI EASON,Very displeased I had to be online for 15 minutes I had to call at least four times and still yet I have not gotten the things I need to withdraw from you.

Stacy Webb,"Overall great service, the only thing is sometimes it would glitch out and I’d have to resubmit a request, but it was an easy fix."
Suzanne McDonough,Not helpful. Wasted my time. Told me what I provided was all wrong etc. Called back and spoke to a manager and found out what I needed to. This girl needs more training.
Veronica Burks,"By local standards it wasn't a lot of money, a retirement fund from the YMCA, part time work in childcare. Also i am appallingly inept w/tech. A super nice helpful guy in Las Vegas Andre helped me initiate back in Sept. There was a brief delay over one omission. Then i was very dismayed when it seemed your company blocked my number. But only 3 days later it was resolved. Thank you so much"
Holly,the person I spoke to was very helpful with my question. I didn't have to wait long to speak to a real person.
customer,"Your representative, Ulonda, was clear, concise, and helpful with details I wasn't able to secure from Fidelity.  Thank her for me.  Bob Connor"
CATALINA,I can not get my distribution with out a check or deposit slip and I don’t use checks or physical deposits so I can’t get my distribution. I think that is so dam stupid no one uses checks anymore or physical deposit slips it’s all done electronically. So what do I do? Get with the times!
ISHAR RAMOS SANCHEZ,She was very helpful on helping me understand
JR unhappy,Talking to a representative was wonderful but still waiting for my direct deposit this waiting is not good not good at all ugh
TERESA SAUCEDA,"Difficult to find the Distribution pages to request a check.  Not at all intuitive to find, took multiple returns to the site.  Needed live chat would have solved quickly"
THOMAS WATSON,"Quick, convenient & user friendly website"
CARLINE BENOIT,"It's extremely hard to move funds out of Millenium. I got charged $25 for account closure. My account was moved to Millenium by my previous employer. I should have opted against it.Update: Millennium customer rep reached out and tried to help me with the situation. Eventually, I was able to get it resolved. Millennium doesn't support ACAT so I had to jump a few hoops to make this transfer happen."
Denise S,No help resetting password
JH,Help me through the application to cash in my 401k was very respectful and helpful thank you
Mark Kelly,Not very helpful was told to do everything on line… called to check the status and asked for it to be rushed and still no updates… the online system doesn’t give you much information
MELVIN SMITH,I think the website can be a little more easier to navigate...Just my opinion but my experience with the representative was excellent

Ronald ,I don’t remember her name but the customer service rep from Illinois was so nice and helpful! She literally stayed on the phone with me as I completed the steps online for something
Aaron,"The people and the service were great. They went out of their way to take care of me and I appreciate it. The problem is that overall my experience is quite negative because .. FEES! so many and so much. I never wanted this account to begin with and it's stupid to try and do business with this company long term. So many better options out there. They get two stars overall since they did have great service. But I'd prefer to never hear from them again.Update: They called me back because I gave them 2 stars and waived about half of what they had charged me in fees. I probably still wouldn't do business with them, but they did really help their credibility with me."
Marilyn,"While it took a bit of time initially and it was a bit difficult to provide the required information, when I went back to the website after a vacation, you had apparently received all that you needed, and I was able to request the 401(k) account be closed and the funds sent to me.  I literally received them via ACH in minutes. Awesome!"
ANGELA KIRK,Every time I need something everyone is always helpful
RAVI PATEL,Employee was not knowledgeable in transferring of funds to another IRA with a different company. Instructions very unclear and vague as if she was trying to avoid the question.

ISAAC HARRIS,First Lady wasn't too helpful but the second time I called the gentleman was very much helpful for me.
VIRGINIA JACKSON,"I want to thank Ms. Veronica for her due diligence providing me the proper information and walking me through the set up account process. When we had some technical issues with locating the proper email to my account, Ms. Veronica sprang into action to get the correct information for my concern. She is professional, knowledgable on all service Millennium Trust has to offer, and patient with the client."
Adam,Great job. She was very pleasant
LORETTA SLEDGE,Luis was very helpful he stayed on the phone with me help me get through some of the trip ups I didn’t understand very professional
JEREMY LEE,"The experience I had with my associate was a pleasant one. The questions I asked were answered in an informative, professional manner. My only issue is the delay in receiving my funds. Respectfully, Randall C. Shull"
CASEY CARROW,"Horrible. Still have not processed cash from one account into another, both at Millennium, and the first of 4 requests were received on Sept 20. Also have not transferred two of our accounts to another custodian after 2 weeks. Would never use Millennium again and we have been there for years. Very dissatisfied"
CURTIS BARNES,"My former company moved my 401K to Millenium. I wanted to roll the fund over to another 401K but the link wouldn't work. I called and spoke with Danielle who was very courteous and helpful. Problem resolved, money will be moved."
Maximilian Rivolo,Super helpful on the phone! Automated prompts felt like a maze.  Did not receive any information about what was next after submitting routing # verification.
Bryan Blair,"I called and worked with Angela on the phone today and she walked me through what I needed to do to get my account transferred. Within 2 minutes of hanging up with her and following the instructions in her email to me, everything was started. My past attempts were confusing and did not work out for me, so I have to give the credit to her clear understanding of what I needed to solve my problem."
MARK MCDANIEL,Very helpful customer service.
RICHARD KING,Everything went very smoothly everybody was very helpful
WARREN LUHNING,"After contacting them, they were able finalize the process for transferring my IRA funds to my current bank. Jessica scheduled a 3-way phone call between the 3 parties involved and we had the issue resolved that day. My funds arrived in my bank shortly thereafter. Thank you to Anthony and Jessica for handling this matter. I am very grateful and relieved!"
RASHAYLA SNOWDEN,"I was send a document asking me to sign it by email. The document was already signed and there was no instructions. I called the main line and the robot only gives you three options.  I asked for customer service and it said I had to login on the website, which I already did! I finally noticed an email with the docusign, so I emailed and only then I was able to have someone call back and assist me about what I needed to do to complete a withdrawal request that was made around 2 weeks ago."
ANGELA GERSHOWITZ,Everybody was very helpful and got me taken care of quick easy and no problems

JONATHAN GRAFFLIN,Great no issues
STEVEN CINTRON,I needed an EIN for some companies that my retirement had rolled over to for my taxes which are now 2 yrs behind bc the IRS keeps sending them back.  Empower was able to provide the phone number to both places within 10 minutes!! It was so expedient and accurate that I had time to stream my afternoon show and still get back to work from my 30 min. lunch on time.  Awesome!
PEYTON THOMAS-HARRISON,"When I was fortunate enough to have the time to break through the labyrinth of automated messages and speak to an actual person, this actual person was quite helpful.As an aside, I note that MTC is still stating ""we are receiving a higher than normal call volume, so you may experience a longer than usual wait"".I experienced this message for nearly a year. At what point does ""higher than normal"" and ""longer than usual"" become ""normal"" and ""usual""?The solution? Hire more people, and/or pay the ones that you hire more money so that they stay. The automated stuff doesn't cut if 98% of the time.The generic, cut and paste response you provided doesn't instill much confidence. If you want to ""make sure we’re providing the best experience possible and the resources you need"", the solution is easy (please see above)."
SHARMILA PRABAKARAN,Site was very self explanatory and customer services was quick and easy.
Autumn Tayman,The rep on the phone (Jackie from Chicago)was extremely helpful.

RENICIA ALEXANDER,Very helpful and patient overall great experience
MARY LADUCER,Set up my account.Everything went well.
JULIE ANDERSON,"Could upgrade to an easier process of transfer from your account to another IRA. The process to fill out a request online, receive latter instructions that take exceedingly long for processing as well as the $25-$30 for wire transfer. All paperwork should be done online versus the current process."
JOSHUA,The representative i spoke to was very helpful. Had me on the phone explaining each step of what to do.
MARTA GETANEH,I was really satisfied and really had some good help. Thanks to the helpers
PAULA MILLS,"The customer service representative was so sweet and helpful. I don’t always like dealing with a recording in the beginning so I requested someone to speak to. I’m so thankful that I had her. She was patient, was able to go into further detail than a recording, and cared."
ROBERTS CHOATE,Im still pending depending on my results i will know for sure where i stand.
ADRITA PROVA,The experience was very terrible
Chris,Jackie from Chicago took the time to explain each step in the process clearly. I appreciated her time and expertise. Excellent customer service on her part.

KARISSA SAWYER,"Spent over and hour just trying to see what my balance was. Created new account online, and at the very last step, site wouldn’t send verification codes to my phone. (Worked fine throughout signup process)They arrived 20 minutes later. The ‘digital assistant’ was utterly useless and wasted a lot more time. On the plus side I was finally able to reach a human being who tried (unsuccessfully) to help me. Process shouldn’t have had to take me more than an hour. Hoping future dealings will be better than my introduction."
YVETTE RODGERS,Good explanation of withdrawn process
SArah,Not showing or telling myself when the funds are available
ALEJANDRO RODRIGUEZ,"I spent an hour on the phone, winding through the interminable maze of things necessary to get my rollover funds dispersed to my financial advisor, specifically making sure they issued the check correctly. Of course that did not happen. Now I'm trying to fix it, and they are apparently unable to do what we need. And they keep pointing out what I supposedly did not do correctly, despite the fact that it was their representative on the phone working with us to issue the check. Frustrated does not begin to cover it. I will probably take the tax hit and deposit the check rather than continue to work with these useless people."
DAVID CLORE,just terrible. long waits and hung up on
JANET KLEIN,The transition was seamless and easy. Live working with the Reps they were awesome
ESTEBAN SEBASTIAN HERNANDEZ,failed to mail out my deduction in a timely manner.
TONY OVERBY,"Website was simple enough to navigate. The one customer call I made was efficient and helpful. I haven't had any feedback about my withdrawal request from last week, but aside from that, I'm pleased."
JAZMIN PEREZ,I’ve had more pleasant experiences at the DMV than I’ve had here. I’ve been trying to remove my money from their fee happy hands for over 5 years. They take every possible step to ensure that they can continue to drain fees from my account. I swear this is the only reason they’re still in business. I would rather have a root canal on a roller coaster than ever deal with this company again. I’m also pretty sure they’ll find a way to charge me a fee for writing this review. Also notice they don’t respond to negative reviews. They only respond to positive ones. That should tell you everything you need to know about a company right there.
DIANE PERRY,"The customer service person was very knowledgeable, went through what I needed to do."
TRINA FRAZIER,Very friendly customer service. Quick and easy .
BRITNEY OWENS,Great job answering my call quickly and verify me. Answering my questions confidently. The agent was professional and kind.

MARVIN MEARS,The process was smooth and easy. I am satisfied with the overall experience.
Nøø Cåp,"I was notified that I had funds in an account 3 months ago. I still have not been able to access my account. It is absolutely brutal trying to set up an account! I am pretty confident they do not want me to have access at this point….sending pictures of a license, validating home address, etc….."
Ivan Tafoya,Still waiting for an email to let me know that I am now allowed to log in to check on my IRA account.
TERA RICHEY,Kate from Customer service was so friendly ans helpful. She answered all my questions and retrieved my account easily. I would definitely work with her again!
Elaine Osborne,They were fast and were able to help me
RANDALL SHULL,You took all my money with the ridiculous fees you charge. I had no idea my money transferred to millennium because it used to be in mass mutual. By the time I got a hold of it my account was drained. I’ll be telling every soul never to go near this company.
DARLA DAMATO,Representative was very helpful
RODNEY SCARBOROUGH,Needed to know about IRA and transferring money the lady explained it to me very  clearly I'm very appreciative.

LORIE JOHNSON,I called to gain access to my account. She helped me and told me aboutbwhat to expect when it came to withdrawing my funds.
DORIAN CHEEKS,Company is pretty easy to transfer out but expensive to use. My old employer started using Millennium Trust for their 403b and there’s a monthly fee to use and a $25 fee to transfer to a different company.
Tula ,"The representative I spoke with was phenomenal. He didn’t seem to be in any rush to get through the call and took time to explain how the process of transferring or withdrawing money worked as well as answering any questions I had to help me fully understand everything. It was also extremely easy to understand him when talking, the call was really clear with no background noise interfering with his voice or causing any interruptions when explaining how this process worked. I honestly couldn’t be any happier with how the call went."
Marisol Cruz,"Amazing customer service, made me feel so much better and at ease about my funds."
TRAVIS BLACKWELDER,I know the lady told me it could take upon 8-10 business days for me to receive my funds. I’m giving it a 4 star review just because the length of time and until I actually receive my funds.
IVY GREENBERG,It was fast and easy!
Carolyn Hall,"My employer selected Millennium Trust to handle connecting me with the IRA they had established on my behalf. After I left my job, I wanted to roll over this balance to a ROTH IRA with Fidelity. Millennium Trust made the process exceptionally challenging to complete what I wanted to do. It took me at least 10-15 hours to talk to people on the phone, send emails, generate letters, find printers, and mail things. Somehow Millenium Trust requires wet signatures in our modern society. I started with the automated letter generator from Fidelity because it contained all the details Millenium Requested for doing a rollover. When I submitted the form as the systems specified, I was told I had made mistakes and that they could not complete my request. I then called Fidelity, and they helped me generate a different letter, and the agent confirmed that they deal with rolling over accounts with Millennium all the time - thus they were sure this would be an easy process. After mailing them this letter from Fidelity, they once again told me I had made a mistake and were unable to complete my request. Finally, I called Millenium, and the rude agent scoffed at my issue and directed me to another way to close the account. Ultimately, there is not enough guidance for transitioning accounts, and what should have taken an hour or two was drawn out over an entire month. Very disappointed."
Jacob Goheen,I was satisfied. My money was in my account minutes after I asked for it. Thank you
THEA ABBOTT,"Was simple, other than when I lost my connection, it wouldn’t let me log back in and finish."
Tim Gopperton,"The information was presented in a manner that was understood clearly. I was procrastinating due to my thoughts of frustration that generally occur when navigating sites such as these. This experience, however, was truly was painless."

James Rourke,I got this for you to come here and I you
JOSE SALAS,Ridiculous wait on money. Everyone blames each other.
DONALD MARSHALL,"you never called me back or emailed me with the solution to my log in problem, I still have no access to my account"
guido tricot,I’ve been forced into a situation that I do not even want to ask for my money to be dispersed from the interlinc and I’m going through this and paying fees I don’t want to pay so I have no good experience and I’m still waiting you’re holding me hostage there’s got to be a log is this type of behavior this is ridiculous
TRACY CAMPBELL,Very helpful... thank you
ANDREW MARTINEZ,"The representative was well informed, friendly and even offered to stay on the phone until I received a form via email. They then walked me through completing the form.  Fantastic service!"
ERICK DECHESNE,"On 9/30/22, I logged onto my previous 401K account from my previous employer to find my small remaining balance was transferred.  After a brief conversation with a representative I was given the number fir Millennium.   The Millennium rep assisted me in setting up my new account with a smile.   Very knowledgeable and personable experience.   What could have been a bad day was good!"
Ashley Menefield,The rep was extremally patient and kind helping me get signed up.

She helped me figure out why I was getting stuck, and then stayed on the phone with me the whole time to make sure I didn't run into anymore problems."
Jeremy Mercer,"From begining to locate and access my rollover 401k from other fund  to Millennium Trust is a very helpfull experienced. All customer service representatives are very helpfull in resolving issues arised. Thank you very much for all, i be able to access my almost 30 yrs 401k plan."
Robbie,"Overall the experience was good, good customer service, but transactions are very slow compared to other providers I have used."
JENNIFER HARTMAN,"This has been a very frustrating process. Nearly impossible to navigate when having multiple accounts and trying to withdrawal money. I have been trying since the 1st of September to initiate an online account and take out the money. Yesterday I tried to speak with a customer service rep and he was clearly working from home. Dogs barking, children screaming. I think they make it very difficult to set up an account and remove your money so they can keep pulling out fees and charges."
RUSTY,David was very patient in helping me through the process of onboarding. I greatly appreciate his assistance!
JESSICA LUCIO,The representative was very helpful. I'm not exactly sure of the date of the interaction with the rep.
CERECE MILES,This process went through three people to get done. The first two took the application and filed it promising to expedite the transaction but evidently never took that action. The third person I worked with did the same and actually did expedite the order extremely fast.
KOLAWOLE AWE,very helpful great people my experience  couldn't have been better !

LAURA CARSON,"I’ve never dealt with a custodian that makes things so difficult. They do everything to hold on to your money and make you jump through excessive hoops to get it transferred. In my last dealing with one of their reps the person either hung up or we lost connection, either way is not good."
CYNTHIA CASTRO,Michelle was great! Very professional and courteous.
Mira,"When I requested a prepaid card, it stated it would not be mailed to a P.O. Box and it would be sent fedex. So I entered my physical address. I don’t get usps mail sent to my house. But the customer service representative stated my card is mailed by usps not fedex. So my card will be sent back to the company and then I was told I’d be charge an additional fee for new card. So frustrating."

Prabhleen Gill,It's was a nice and fast experience.
Jonathan C,I’ve been unable to log in to my account. My company closed the IRA they were putting in to and my account got transferred to Millennium. I couldn’t figure out why I could not completely log onto my account when I finally called it was because the last letter of my name was left off. I had to send in a copy of my ID it was told it would be fixed the next day. I just called a week later and it was never input it. I had to do the whole process once again. I felt such little care for this as soon as I can login to my account I will be pulling my money from this company and not choosing to continue to use it

Marta Fussalva,Robin was very patient and professional. Which is very refreshing nowadays.
ICHRISTIAN CURRENCE,"I called to get clarification about the withdrawal process and I did receive all of the information correctly.  The phone disconnected and the agent called me back immediately.  The only feedback I would offer is that this agent had difficulty having a back-and-forth conversation.  When I attempted to clarify something, she said I am telling you now. It was just a bit off putting. Not enough for me to downgrade the level of service I received, but enough to help that agent in the future."
Eleazar Moreno,I had the most difficult time getting my account access and it should not have been so hard. Because I would not send my personal data and social security info on email this hindered me from getting access in a timely manner. The codes and access to login were also incorrect and I had to call multiple times and spend more time than I have on the line with a lovely customer service rep that kept telling me it was ok to send my personal info to their secure email but having had identify theft that was not ok for me. We finally agreed to a work around where I encrypted my document with a password and someone called me to open the file. But this was just not how business should be done. Very frustrating.
PATRICK WHEELER,Online application is too difficult for those that have limited experience in using a computer.  Wasn't able to attach a picture as requested.  Best is to just send in by mail
JOYCELYN GRANT,4 Star Rating because the phone call cut off several times while trying to speak to an agent and it gives me a hard time to reach out to an agent.

CAMILLE LOWMAN,"I couldn't get into my account online. When logging in, there was a  message that said my phone number didn't match what was on my account. I called the number on the message. The Millennium representative was very friendly and sending me a code got me into my account. They asked me if there was anything else they could help me with, I said no. I told her that she rocked!. Then we said goodbye."
SEAN BENNETT,"I called 3 weeks ago asking for assistance regarding the roll over of my account to my new employer, the staff that answered my needs are helpful although I have to wait on the phone for quiet a long time while transferring my call to the right person, other than that things get done and my experience is satisfactory."
Thomas SHALVOY,I was forced into a roll over to this company and when I opted to roll over to the company I work for instead they charged me an account opening fee and a closing fee all with in the 7 days that I was notified that the roll over would happen.
NAYVADIUS STONE,I am a little mad that I am being charge to close my account that I didn't choose to have with your company.

Peter Sibley,Ok it was good
BAILEY RHODES,did very well very polite & very helpful 👍👍
ZAIDI CHEMAT,"I wish I caught my ira from previous employment before it rolled to this company. Terrible service from millennium. I will forever stay with and trust fidelity and always used them for my ira investments due to their speedy responsiveness, great service and SAME DAY transfers, always hassle free with them. I called  Millennium to get my money faster to close on my house on a Wednesday, told by representative I would get a call back from a supervisor, never got that call, had to check in again friday and no luck. Had to wait until Monday to get my money and close late on my home! Glad to have closed my account and will catch my roll overs before they ever get transferred to this company again. Horrible service members. Even worse supervisors. All around terrible experience."

GUILLERMO HERRERA,Great customer service and guidance. The staff was very knowledgeable.
LEONARD JANKOWSKI,"Millennium Trust's customer service for individual account holders sucks. It does everything in its power to put a customer through automated chatbots, which can be decent guides for people who don't actually educate themselves with what the website has to offer, but is a black hole for when you need the answer to a question that the website does not clarify. Their ""live contact"" link goes to what appears to be a chat window, with ""live chat"" in big letters, and ""waiting for agent"" at the top. Truth is, agent will never come. But they never tell you that. They're trying to lead you through a tree of questions, where all it does is give you links to other parts of their website. And it actually has nothing to do with the availability of an agent during business hours. This is the experience 24/7.At some point, the chatbot will eventually tell you that if you need more help, to contact support. Isn't that *exactly* what this Support Link/Live Chat is supposed to be? (and this Contact page to get support is itself conveniently buried under ""Profile"", otherwise you won't find it anywhere else). And when they tell you to contact support, they don't even specify how. It takes another path through Q&A to get to the point where they give you a number to call (these places usually do a great job of hiding any contact phone number).  When you call the number, of course it tries to keep you away from a real person for as long as possible, but if you call during (east coast) business hours, eventually you'll  get a real person.I eventually was able to talk to a real person, but it took me from a Friday to Monday morning to realize what was going on and how things worked. The interaction with the agent itself was fine and this is not a commentary on the experience with the agent.I understand that Millennium Trust is probably built to serve large institutions more than retail account holders, but still, that bulls*** ""live chat"" and ""waiting for agent"" is exceptionally and purposely deceptive."

For all of the negative reviews, I hope this one is helpful in turning that around. In making my request, I left out no steps and made sure the information was correct. It paid off!"

DUSTIN TARVER,not directly answer my questions and point me to the website for the instruction.
YAKOV LISSOVSKIY,I've been in the process of trying to get the funds from my IRA account rolled over to my new employers retirement account and it has been a nightmare. Millennium trust has emailed me time and time again that I did not submit the forms correctly even after following their instruction via phone and email on how to submit my rollover request. This has been going on for more than a month at this point. I'm not sure if they know what they are doing over there but this is definitely not a company I would work with. BEWARE!
RITIKA CHOPRA,Send me a personalised email before trying to get me to write a review
Jeannie Pallazola,"I have tried to setup my retirement account info on line 3 times, Talked with customer service 3 times to get help. Nothing has been accomplished in fixing the issues. All I would like to do is access my account. I do not recommend any financial services from this company.Update: This company's incompetence continues! After finally getting access to my account and requesting a full distribution. The process is like pulling teeth with no novacan! You will talk to endless representatives and they will tell you all is good. Than when it's near the time to reicieve your money, they will say something is missing. And its another 10 days and another. PEOPLE DO NOT INVEST WITH THIS COMPANY!!!!!!! If I could.give them a negative 10 I would!!"

I was amazed to have the funds in my account today not up to two hours after gaining assess to the account."
ERIKA BACHMANN,Customer service was out standing.  Very helpful

KATHRYN PEEL,I requested for my IRA from my old job to be transferred to my current Financial Advisor months ago. They said they needed the correct address. I gave it to them and heard nothing else.

MARICELA OSORIO,"They were extremely patient, helpful, professional."
ANITA ARROYO,My experience today on September 21st 2022 was not a good experience. My customer service rep Mina from Chicago was excellent and very patient with me. My experience with trying to cash out of my retirement funds was time consuming and unaccomplished. Although I complete one of my retirement accounts the IRA Roth I still have to send a photo of my check stub in order to get my money. I could not get money out of the 401 k today because I can only do one account at the time. So I have to do it all over again tomorrow.It has to be a better way to get your funds without going through this long process. On top of that you still have to wait about 2 weeks to get your funds.
MISTY HOOPER,Difficult getting in touch with a real person to get assistance and advice not found online. Speaking with a real person also proved to be unhelpful.
LEZA ELDORADO,The process in cashing out my 401 k was extremely seamless and efficient! The rep I spoke with was very helpful and polite! It was truly a great experience.

customer,Thank you for making the process easy and quick!
REGINALD TAYLOR,"My experience with Millennium Trust was an unnecessary hassle.Having to request an address change for a utility bill as my physical address is different from my mailing address was ridiculous, I had sent in a confirmation of payment from Chrysler credit showing my physical address and mailing address but they wouldn’t accept it. That was not a bill. I finally got the water department to include my post office box number and physical address on the water bill. And that was accepted. I believe they keep your money as long as possible."
TATIANA BOJENOK,nice service

JUDITH BECKETT,The lady who answered my call was very helpful and the transaction concluded to my satisfaction.

I was also very surprised to learn that once I selected direct deposit, that my funds would be in my account in a matter of hours....NOT days.

CHHO,Their website is very difficult to navigate and logging into my account has required a phone call every time in order to gain access. This has been true for the last two years. I am now trying to close out my account with them.
SOFIA WOLTERS,I struggled for months to get my identity authenticated. It is very hard to get ahold of anyone and reaching anyone online is a joke. I spoke to 3 different people and they all told me completely different reasons as to why my identity was not authenticated yet. The first agent actually told me she didn't know how to help me and to call back in a few days.
VICTORIA COLE,Great! Thank you

Margaret Nail,Questions answered easily; kind agent. Okay quick & easy.
Ruby,The representative I spoke with was not helpful at all I would ask her a question and she would answer it with a question then finally she told me what I asked but she was very rude
BEVERLY MCKEE,"Horrible, horrible, horrible. Had my funds sent here by a previous employer and it has been MONTHS and I'm still unable to get my money away from them and onto my current employer's plan. Online ""customer service"" will send you in circles, insisting you didn't submit forms you absolutely did. Template answers only, no real humans to be found. They very transparently work to prevent you being able to get your money away from them (and will steal your money the second they have it in ""fees"" to open the account you never asked for, and fees to close it if/when you ever manage to get your money back). How this place hasn't been shut down as the scam it is is beyond me."
JAYNA BINION,The Representative was so stuck on “protocol“ that I couldn’t even ask a generic question about whether we could use our form or they had a specific form. He said he had to talk to the owner of the account just to tell me whether they have their own forms ridiculous protocol
Danielle Mitchell,"Closed the account over a week ago, and still have not received the funds.  Understand this takes time, but no communication and no action."
DAVID FIGAROTTA,"I had the most awesome representative on the line to help me get through this procedure of obtaining information of getting an account started, and what my options were with the money I had in there. After I have talked with her, I felt relieved from a long-time stress, and she was able to help me with my husband also since he had brain surgery. She is definitely a great access to your staff."
DAVID WILLIAN BENE,"Attempted to close account through distribution, website was frustrating as I couldn't continue my request with the tracking number it gave. After re-requesting I had to prove my bank account was mine by supplying a voided check.  So I reached into my check book and....oh wait it's 2022 nobody has a checkbook.  I got what I now know is called a starter check from my bank, it was not accepted as my name was written not printed. However I was not notified that my starter check was not sufficient after 5 days, I called the help line and was told it wasn't sufficient proof. The gentleman said a direct deposit form would work just fine. Would've been nice for the website to mention ANY OF THIS. So here I am, one week into the process, no confirmation email or anything and I have to wait potentially 10 business days to receive my distribution. Thanks millenium trust for making me jump through frustrating hoops with little to no info as to where we are in the process just to get, MY MONEY. Never again."

Leroy Northam,"I was told that my request for distribution was all set to go by one agent and then received an email stating that I needed to give them a call and another agent, who was not very friendly, told me that I needed to submit more info. I was expecting to receive my funds this coming Friday 9/23. But instead the process has started over for another 10 days."
SHANNON LEE,Cannot access my account and have filled out additional forms to verify my identity and will accept changes to my contact info for 2 factor authentication. Been almost 2 weeks since sending in my info for ID verification
ASHLEY HEYWARD,"Your company did not help me one bit, & I know I'll receive a recorded message no doubt. All I'm asking for is guidance, not a recorded message, even though my balance is low, it may not be in the future.Your company does not make it easy to help, despite your claims.Please advise, don't put me on hold for 2.5 hours, then exit the call (hang up), you're probably laughing at my claim, but it's true, all I'm looking for is help.I'm tired of not being listened to.-Liam Beesley"

SONIA CHAVARRIO,So many points to identify me for an account that I did not set up.  I gave everything correct.  But I do not have a passphrase so I have to set one up.  The second question to set up the passphase is the last 4 of account #.  If I'm calling to find out about money that was sent to your company without my knowledge how do you expect me to have that info??????
Rudy Garcia,Excellent customer Service! Thank you! Listened and answered my question
CRYSTAL BOTTERBUSCH,The phone automatically sends you to a robot instead of a human.Had to keep pressing 0 to get any insight as to what was happening to my account. As soon as I can I will be withdrawing my whole account value. Only reason for any stars was that the girl on the other end did actually answer my question when I finally reached her. Very frustrating.

Having recently retired a learning to live within a 'fixed income' your team was helpful in giving me all options available to me regarding rollover, withdrawal/distribution, etc.  Thank-you for all the guidance."

ROBERTA CANSLER,I Needed to close out an older amount and everything was clear and easy.
CASSANDRA HYMAN,"This has been an extremely frustrating company to deal with.  Trying to access 401k funds that were transferred from another company.  It's almost as if there are hoops to be jumped through so that this company can keep others' funds and collect interest while simultaneously charging 'fees'.  They send a six digit code after verifying you, but they supposedly send a second code to an email which never arrives.  No it is not in the junk folder.  May have to get a lawyer involved."
NANCY UNG,The entire process of reviewing and working within the site is easy and very informative.
Lala,"*s* no offensive words needed!  Your personnel were extremely helpful and pleasant, even when I asked a question that even I felt was a bit foolish.  I just wanted to make certain there were no issues.  Your folks were great!"

JULIO MENDEZ,"Requested disbursement of my account on 09/05/22, submitted documentation at that time to deposit it our joint checking account.  I called and spoke with Michelle in Pittsburgh on 9/13 to check the status of the disbursement and she said everything looked good and the funds should be in my account on 9/19/22.  I received an email on 9/15 saying there was an issue.  On 9/16/22, I went into the portal and uploaded a copy of the check again.  I then called to follow up and spoke with Jackie in Chicago who advised my name has to be on the check.  My name is on the account, however, we use checks minimally and have never ordered new checks with my name on the account.  The address is on the check and I offered to send a copy of the bank statement with my name on the account which is listed on the check.  They advised I would have to contact the bank, have them submit a one page document on letterhead with account number, routing number, and my name as being on the account.  My major issue is that now the process starts all over again and I have to wait 10 more business days for the funds to be processed.  If I would have known this when I spoke with Melissa, I could have addressed the issue then.  No matter what I do, the process starts all over again today and it will take 2 MORE weeks (10 business days) before the funds are processed.  I don't understand why the process has to start all over again."
MICHAEL CHAVEZ,Very helpful and answered all questions appropriately

RYAN,The guy that I talked to did an amazing job
GENEVIEVE BUCKLEY,"great customer support, very personable customer rep."
Dave,"While the employees I spoke with are very pleasant, overall, there is a lack of fundamental communication with their clients, and very generalized information on email confirmations, with little to no details on the next steps after you’ve submitted a withdrawal request. Compared to other Trust companies I’ve worked with, this is by far the longest it has taken to have a disbursement distributed to my account - currently going on 10+ business days now. Again, the people were nice, but I will use a different Trust company in the future with more efficient logistics and personalized communication."
STEPHANIE,"Great job, helped me no problem."

CEE,These people that helped me made me feel right at home with their service
Jeremiah Quintanilla,"I appreciate the service Millennium Trust provides, however, I did not choose MT, it was the default company for my employer.  I found that MT does not offer a return on investment worthy of my trust, my profit was eaten up by the fees.  I also found that communicating with MT was very difficult and wrenching my accumulated savings from them to put into my regular IRA was a two year ordeal.  If MT was more feduciary and less one sided profit oriented; it would still be better to put your savings in a shoe in your closet than invest with MT."
LINDA SIKES,5 star will work with them again
Barbara Turnure,STILL waiting for my refund card to come and have had to have it resent once already?  It is a little frustrating.
DAVID WILTON,"It was very helpful w/ all the instructional directions, & the person that helped me last March."

SHANON FONDA,"I had the absolute pleasure of working with Amber from AL. She went above and beyond to walk me through a very difficult process of coming out of shame, tracking down my 401k after 15 years of inactivity, and taking back my financial control. I was an emotional wreck and she had a keen sensitivity to my situation and literally praised me for taking control, told me she would walk me through everything so that I could be verified and able to remain in control. She was so professional and sharp and when I shared that my plan was to transfer my money to a new brokerage, when asked she gently answered all my questions about the competitiveness of Millennium Trust Company. She didn’t hard sell me, she just shared the great things of the company and I am strongly now considering staying with a company that would hire such wonderfully caring people that have strong human character and integrity. Amber literally changed the trajectory of my day which was going not well with her tender and fully invested cheerfully positive disposition. Millennium Trust is very lucky to have such a kind and professional woman working for them."
CYNTHIA ANDERSON,"Clear procedures along with helpful individuals to speak with, makes doing business with Millennium Trust a pleasure."

MARY ABBOTT,"Need help logging in, I was helped right away"
DANIEL MCGANN,"I have tried numerous times to access my Millennium account online. I set a password, they send a code, then ask for a phone number. The text to my phone always says ""access unavailable for this user"". Perhaps that is because I only have a simple TracFone. When I contact the company by telephone, they say they have reset everything and I will have access.  NO, apparently not. They have asked if perhaps one of my daughters might help with this, but if I use another person's phone, then that number is on permanent record as the contact. Surely i am not the only person without a smart phone, so I have a hard time believing that there is not another way to accomplish setting up access to my account. Very discouraging!"
GISLENE DA FONSECA BORGES,You do not get the same information from consultants and it’s frustrating. I only have the account with the company due to it being transferred
DEXTER PERKINS,My customer service rep was very helpful and knowledgable. Great hire!
THANG MUANG,"My 401k had rolled over to Millennium from a different company that had the account through a former employer. I was having difficulty accessing the online portal in order to do a distribution and had spoken to one of your agents their requesting assistance. She was very courteous and texted me a link that enabled me to download the required paperwork for the distribution, I have since filled that out and mailed it to fulfill that task. She was very helpful in assisting me filling out that paperwork as well."
DOUGLAS POWELL,"Good cs, she was very helpful w us. The automated voice wasn’t as good, because it had a hard time picking up what we were saying. Person talking on phone was great"

DANIEL BANGERTER,"It has been a very long but drawn out process to get my need information for a forgotten account. Greer from Chicago was especially helpful(GIVE HER A RAISE).

PORTIA MARTIN,Easy contact and communication with rep. Walked me though process thoroughly
ALEXANDRA GLEASON,"The process to move the Rolliver IRA to my existing 401K took about 3.5 weeks. I think this time period is excessive. In addition, all of the communications were done online when I would have preferred to speak with someone, at least to begin the process. I hope the check gets here soon so I can send to my 401K provider."

Carolyn C,I have been waiting on a check from you for a LONG time after submitting all documentation
Christopher Marshall,"Honestly I can’t speak much about the company since I have never dealt with them before. However I did have a question about an online form and had to call in to talk to an agent. I know I asked a few dumb questions but I would like to think they were very normal especially for someone who’s never heard of or had an IRA account. The representative, Peggy, was very short and rude with me. At one point the phone cut out and I couldn’t hear her so I politely asked if she could hear me and got no response. After about 30 seconds to a minute I finally heard her voice say “hello?” and I asked if she could hear me she said yes. I apologized and let her know the phone cut out and let her know the last thing I heard. She sighed heavily on the phone and said “you really didn’t hear anything I said?” as if you imply that I did that on purpose and my call was an inconvenience to her. I understand calls dropping is annoying but none the less it’s not like it was intentional and it’s not like I had an attitude with her. So I’m not quite sure what her exact issue was but what I can say is she was the face of the company for my call and I can only assume that her behavior is accepted by the company and it’s management and that alone let’s me know I’ll never do business again with this company. All I wanted to know was the difference between withdrawal and distribution just to make sure I was filling out the right form online. Glad I finally got the question answered even if there was unnecessary attitude."
Customer,"My 401k was switched to this company. They charge a ridiculous amount of fees, $25 here $50 a year, $10 here for paper….such a sham….avoid if possible"

Brad Baughman,"My previous employer transferred my 401K to this company. I wanted to consolidate my 401K accounts by moving my money from this account to my new 401K fund. Their process is so cumbersome and they are not willing to assist you at all. I submitted what I thought was sufficient documentation from the new 401K fund(Fidelity) following the paperwork requirements by mtrust. All I got was - this is not enough, here review our list of 30+ bullet points. Which is what I followed initially. I emailed them back asking for clarification as to which bullet points did I miss or if they can tell me what else I need to submit. I got a very vague, lazy email saying ""call this number"" clearly trying to push the responsibility to somebody else who answers the phone calls. I pulled my money and closed my account. I would rather pay the penalty then dealing with lazy people who just want to get their pay check and do nothing in the meantime to assist the customers."
BRANDON DINDORF,It was very quick... Thanks alot
GARY KWAN,"Quick and easy REQUEST, response...great service!"

Diana Ward,"Millennium Trust website was so easy to navigate throughout from creating my account to accessing my money.

NOELLE BOISVERT-ROACH,"my call was taken by Yolanda from Nevada. She started off speaking very quickly and I had to ask her to slow down. Her directions were unclear to me. When I explained what I wanted, she sarcastically said that's called a rollover"". i asked her if she was going to help me with the rollover process she said yes. She asked me for my personal information so I gave it to her. She then emailed me a long letter with a link, told me to read it and fill it out. She explained I need to put in all my details which I had just provided to her. Confused, I explained I just gave it to her and she said I need to add more information. Being that is was lengthy email with instructions, I was unclear if she would stay on the line while I read through the email and link attached, etc. to guide me through it. She said yes she would (what I understood as she would stay on the line). Yolanda abruptly ended the call. Prior to contacting Mellinnium Trust I had been on the phone with customer reps from both Transamerica and Prudential (now Empower). Their customer service was excellent. Although I was withdrawing my 403b funds and I never created an online account with Transamerica, the representative walked me through the rollover process. He explained their process, went over email he sent as while we were on the telephone and even made a conference call to Prudential.  They both helped thru the process in a respectful, coherent and patient manner. If my call had been calling Mellinnium Trust for  anything other than rolling over, it would have definitely turned into a rollover after her poor service."
CARMEN JARILLO,401 k with drawl
DELANE BUSS,The young lady who assisted me was very kind and patient.  She is a great asset to your organization.
CustomerSuzy,"Gloria was very disrespectful by not letting me speak or explain my situation and demand social security, when she insisted  that she could not wait so long in  the line, I let her know that my husband was working and that I only needed his authorization, already a Once he answered the phone, he asked for a moment to look at a photo since he does not have it memorized his social, she insisted and insisted to the point that my husband said that she was behaving in a very bad way, not letting him speak. I told her that the Spanish line took a long time and if we could speak Spanish, she answered I can't speak Spanish to you, because you chose the English option, when she said she does speak Spanish, this had never happened to me… this is very unprofessional, rude to the point of arguing with me, and have to raise my voice and hang up at her ."

JOSE FRANCISCO,Great customer service and understanding..very helpful staff
SAUL CHAVEZ,"I my ex company didn't want to deal with managing their pensions any more I guess. So they transferred it to Millenium Trust into an IRA.  My IRA is less than $4K. It was set up with the following fees:1. $30/year for ""management"" (they literally do nothing, no investment strategy, nothing.  Just sits in an account earning 25 cents / month).2. They also charged me $10 just to send the notification in the mail to me that they now had my IRA funds.  And this $10 is also a yearly fee (for each annual report)By the time I was able to intervene, They had removed $70 from my IRA. And my ""managed"" retirement savings had earned $3.3. Oh, and as a final parting display of Wall Street greed, they will take another $25 from my savings as a ""Closing Account Fee"" when I roll it into my Roth, which is managed by an honest company with NO yearly fees. Thanks for robbing a poor working stiff's miniscule retirement savings.  Enjoy your ill-gotten gains.  We are sharpening the guillotine for all of you Wall Street leeches.  The pitch-forks are coming.UPDATE: To their credit, Millenium Trust called me after this review and restored the $70 in maintenance fees they had so far taken out.  I'm still going to transfer my money out though, and will still pay the $25 fee to close the account.  But I appreciate this gesture from them."

CASSANDRALAD H-EMERS,You made this process so easy. Thank you
Kevin Bye,"This is really getting ridiculous, I was told it would take 1 to 2 business days for my distribution to be deposited. I called after 2 days and was told it would take up to 5 business days. I called after 5 and was then told 8 business days, I sent an email and then they told me 10 business days! I can't find any information on when exactly I'm going to get my money because nobody knows apparently."
Pamela,Unable to register on the website. I have no idea what money I have available because I have been trying to register for two days and get an error message every time. Now I’m scared this company isn’t legit and I’ve put my info out there.

Triniece Peters-Johnson,"I had a tough investment question for your team. Knowing that the initial agent would not be able to answer my question, she appropriately passed my call along to another department. After being quickly transferred through 3 different agents, I reached someone who understood what I was asking, and he addressed the questions I had without hesitation to the best of his ability. Some people may have been frustrated with the transfers to other departments, I was happy that the Millenium agents were not just “trying” to answer my inquiry. I left the conversation with some confidence in Millenium Trust and will continue to utilize their service. Thank you."
NALLELY ESCAMILLA,"One of my retirement accounts was rolled over to Millennium Trust by mistake.  I filled out forms with my brokerage agency to request that the account be returned to my broker.  They sent all the documentation to Millennium Trust at the beginning of August, along with a follow-up letter in mid-August.  As of the end of August, Millennium Trust has no record of receiving the paperwork, and nothing has happened.  They clearly have serious problems with the handling of documents received by paper mail.  And . . . Even since that time, more documents have been mailed to the *correct* address, a fax has been sent to the correct number (I saw the confirmation), and Millennium Trust still has no record of anything.  I called customer support, but all they tell me is that they haven't received anything.  This whole thing sounds really suspicious to me."
KRISTIE SHARP,The representative that was on the phone was excellent!!!  She stayed on the phone and walked me through the process.  She was so knowledgeable and patient.
Margaret,"It was a bit tedious, but I was able to compete w/o assistance.  Hopefully my funds will be transferred to my bank..."
Aaron Ehrie,"Amazing Customer Service. Thank you, Angela and Myra!"
ROBERT SMIALKOWSKI,All due respect I'm not pleased at all! I worked hard for what little money my past employer rolled over which was $908.50... Well since then I am so it has depreciated and I got hit with a lot of things and almost 7 months ago I requested from my bank which is synthetic credit Union for my money to be rolled over well on your end I guess you didn't get it and it was sent by my banker she is a manager who does her job efficiently so I don't know why anyone from mutual trust did not receive my transferred paperwork by the bank a financial institution. And it's taking me through a whole bunch of loops just to transfer my money so for that I'm really not liking this organization so hopefully I can get this issue resolved really soon I had to log on into the system and become a member and that was something I did not want to do I simply wanted my funds rolled over and transferred into my personal bank account which would make an IRA that I was trying to set up and that I will do very soon of course meanwhile by waiting on this process my money is dumbing down in your system and that's something I'm just not agreeing with!
Anonymous ,"I had a 401k switch to Millenium Trust with no notification. I had to hunt down the account holder and was given the wrong info twice. I found the money and registered as a client. The website didnt work to upload photos to verify identity. Had to email them, then it took two more weeks to hear from them that i had access to my account. I made numerous calls to try to navigate the website. Everyone i spoke with had to solve a different problem. They told me it was fixed, but got off the phone and an email said it would be three more business days to get into my account. Very frustrating!"

Ali Cheaito,I was unable to get a response regarding my accounts distribution. It has now been 6 business days and the ACH isn’t even pending with my bank.
STEVE MUNGIA,"The customer service representative was nice and was able to answer my questions to the best of her ability.

MARIBEL SANTIBANEZ,Nice company
Renee Johnson,website is not user friendly. i tried to do a rollover and it seems like a lot of red tape
Kevin Bachman,"I think the fact you ask people to leave out offensive words tells you exactly what it is like dealing with you. If there were negative stars, I would leave them. Your charges are ridiculous."

Derek Martin,I constantly had to call your office to ask about my dispersal of funds. Each time your csr wouldn’t exactly let me know how long it takes for you to send the funds to my bank account. Unfortunately after several promises of my funds being delivered to my account there was terrible results. I spent several hours at my bank trying to get all sorts of letters to help you send my funds. As of today I still haven’t received my money. I explained that I needed the funds as soon as possible due to my extremely intense situation to no avail I didn’t feel like your a good fit for me financially.
Luman,Jose Was very courteous and stayed on the phone with me every step of the way when I needed help he was absolutely wonderful and went above and beyond to help me with what I needed
CHELSEA RIFFE,"When I began this process I thought I would be leaving a 1 star negative review due to my first impressions of your business.  However, due wholly to Marlene I have adjusted that to 4 stars.  She is the only reason I have gained any confidence back that the company may have a customers best interest at heart.To explain, my funds were rolled over to MTC by a former employer.  I contacted the company to have my funds distributed back to me as I have been battling cancer, multiple surgeries & procedures & everything that comes with it.  My first contact was met with what I felt was unprofessional & rude behavior by your customer service agent as I was trying to explain my situation (I was asked why I ""didnt look at my mail since December"" etc insinuating fault on my end) & felt it was met with impatience, talking over me & general condescending attitudes.  After I asked to speak with a manager I was connected with Marlene.  At every step she was professional, she kept her word as to what to expect & when. I felt the way you SHOULD feel when entrusting your funds & future in someone elses hands.  I WISH she had been my first contact as then I could've in good conscience given a 5 star review.  As a professional myself who has worked in customer service at all levels I understand that sometimes our front line/first contact customer service personnel fails to push forward the spirit or values the company holds as standard.  You never know what a customer is going through or often times why someone needs a dispersement but everyone should be treated respectfully.  Marlene is an asset to your company & someone who you should be proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with...Please make sure that she is recognized for her vital role in being the reason my mind was completely adjusted regarding MTC by her compassion & prompt execution of my dispersement."
MICHELLE B,"It said it would take 1 to 2 business days. It has been 5 days and still don't have anything. I have another 401k with a previous employer so may I ask you a question. Since I'm over the 54 1/2 age do I have to pay the 25% early withdrawal tax.Please advise where my withdrawal could be. I will try to contact someone on Monday. Thx for your help.Sincerely,Terry Harmon"

I had forgotten my password so I figured that was going to be a problem getting information on my account. But I had a genuine excellent experience. The young lady I spoke with, I wish I can remember her name but she was great. First of all I could tell she was eager to help get the link to change my password. But to my surprise she was very professional and nice getting me the information I needed on my account. She really took the time to answer my questions.

Billy,The Website / Portal was easy to navigate.
Karla Rivera,Customer was very helpful
Travis Sterner,"First time user of Millennium Trust online services.  Wanted a partial distribution from my account.  The request form was easy to prepare, very intuitive user-friendly software.

Amanda Thomason,"My 401k from my job was sent to this company from another company. I requested a distribution. It’s been a week & I still have not received the funds. I called customer service & the automated system try’s to keep you from speaking to an agent saying that they have high call volume. As I kept asking for an agent then Im told my hold time is less than 2minutes (high call volume). Once the agent answered his demeanor was that he was being bothered to the point you could hear sighs. The most he could tell me was there is a delay, we could mail you a check which would take longer through the mail. I only had little interaction with this company but the little I had was not good & it’s not a company I would want to do business with in the future."
Disgruntled,Millennium Trust took over my account when my previous employer closed. They made it easy to check on my acct and to withdraw it to my new employer when the time came. I highly suggest them.
GREGORY GEHRING,I don't have any complaints or suggestions at this time. This is the first time I ever heard about this company.  I called for assistance on 8/25/22 & the customer service rep was helpful and polite. He answered my question and he listened to me.

Yolamnda,My previous employer transferred my fund's with them and I've requested a distribution of my fund's and they send me a survey of my experience before I get my fund's. No I'm not satisfied at the moment. Stop thinking of your reputation and provide me my services 1st before asking how I feel about you duh.

Reginald Moser,"I was so worried about always taking my RMD every year, I decided to close the account. That also worried me! So often when one connects with a company, it is a computer. I was thrilled when Ward, from Iowa, answered the phone. He was so helpful and and talked me through the whole process. I am so happy and relieved. Thank you Ward and Millennium Trust.Sincerely, Aggie Williamson"
Alvin  Conway,"Everything had been good. Great Customer Service. Website is good overall some self service areas could be made simpler with clearer understanding of what MT is requesting from the user. The problem came when I submitted a DocuSign document that the Customer Service Rep so graciously took the time on Aug 17, 2022 to walk me through to completion was found nowhere in the system although I had the completed signed copy right in front of me. I was shocked as there is a time restraint on my end, so to think that it was being processed only to find out that not only is it not being process but that it was nowhere to be found was a little breathtaking. I ended up having to forward the completed dated and time stamped form to Distribution which means that the process started 4 to 5 days after the original date of submission"
Taylor,"Prompt service, courteous, very helpful!"
Grumpy old man,Participated in a three way call where they were taking care of a fives transfer. Handled well and quickly
Christopher Pierre-Louis,The most clear and concise information on all their services and what they do with your account available online within seconds.

wcu,She do good job
MADELEINE GONZALEZ,I started this account when I was 19 because I didn’t understand how money works at the time. I put away $1000 into my millennium trust account and after 10 years of never touching that money I came back to check my account again and I lost half my money so this company is entire freaking waste of time when it comes to making or saving money I promise. They charge fees every month for “service fees” but truly they don’t do anything for your account besides steal your money
TRICIA RICA VELASCO,Good company but don’t need millienum trust anymore
ROXANA ARREAGA,My transaction with Millennium was a very pleasant one. Easy to follow directions and was smooth and quick

Dame,Way to many hoops to jump through just to get my information. Why do people have to submit a picture of their id's to gain access to their accounts.  I dont trust this company with all my information and will now move my funds else where.
Cynthia Sharrow,My agent today was amazing. She even stayed on the line with me as I filled out the forms.
NANCY ROSS,There was a lot of misleading information given. There was also a lot “beating around the bush”.
Allison Hale Aly,I really love how simple and efficient the online process was. Great service
DANIEL CASTANON,Customer service was a pleasure to work with. I did not roll over my retirement fund when I left my last role so it transferred here and they helped me easily gain access. Website is user friendly and very easy to navigate (which is hard to find nowadays for retirement companies).
SARAH HAY,"Today I spoke with Calvin, he was knowledgeable and very helpful."
Brandi Wilson,Prompt and friendly service. Got what I needed to get done quickly and with clear guidance.
KENNETH LAWRENCE,Very Nice informative and patient people to help you
T.A,"In the three weeks since I wrote my last bad review, I haven't received my money. I called again today and was informed that the online form I'd submitted requesting my distribution had been marked ""abandoned."" I was told the notes from my call three weeks ago stated I was advised to talk to a tax professional and that was it. Totally inaccurate. I had to resubmit the same form three times and finally got confirmation it went through, but I had gotten the same confirmation last time, and when I told the person on the phone that, and she flatly didn't believe me. She didn't even consider looking into whether what I was saying was true. My experience with this company has shown them to be confusing, inefficient, ineffective, and inaccurate. Companies like this are the reason there are laws against being unnecessarily and intentionally obtuse in order to bilk people out of their money. If you've been notified Millennium Trust has taken over an account of yours, start the process to get it out of their hands immediately."
FAUSTINO C,I was able to get access to my funds through the webpage very easily.  The system is very efective.
ALEX KANAKARIS,staff was very helpful he did finish our request.
HOWARD ISENBERG,"The woman I spoke with (I believe her name was Roxy from Chicago) was informative, concise, and polite. Great interaction."
NICHOLAS MILLER,"Please , Please put something in place for peole like myself who is HOMELESS and because the employees at Millennium Trust needed an address before verify who i am made it very emotional for me because i had to share with them the i am HOMELESS. It put a lot of stress on me on top of the stress i'm going thru. Please do something to help people who are temporarily HOMELESS. PLEASE TRY TO BE MORE SENSITIVE TO US. PLEASE!!"
SUDHIR SAHASRABUDHE,The person I spoke with was able to help me with my questions and it was taken care of in a timely manner
Joseph Roman,I was able to speak to a customer rep near immediately and within few minutes my problem was resolved.
FLORABEL UY,"Decent wait time to speak with an agent, who was friendly enough.  New account, rolled over from old employer.  No correspondence from old investment group, old employer or Millennium came as a surprise.  New user account not the easiest to set up.  Also have to wait 3 days for account to activate before seeing my funds. Hopefully it becomes easier to track."
PHILLIP KNOFF,Thank you for getting a hold of my retirement funds when it was rolled over. I greatly appreciate the customer service line as well for helping with the process!
SHARON JOHNSON,It was almost impossible to get on the website to see for myself what the extent of my account was. Finally I called customer service representative who was difficult to reach. The second or third time that I was able to reach a customer service representative the person just told me the extent of the account. I was not able to login on the website to see for myself. I am still waiting for the money to arrive to the place where I asked the money to be sent. I am still waiting for the money to arrive
CHRISTOPHER JONES,Great interaction
RICHARD FREUND,For my situation the process is taking to long . I understand there is alot of frauds .

Unwilling Account Holder,I got a letter in the mail from Millennium Trust today about a previous job's retirement plan that I couldn't access before and within a few hours after setting up an account which was very easy I was able to close the old account out.

JOYCE MALONE,Love this company makes everything easy and affordable
KELLY KNOTT,I came to roll over to my current employer’s 403b. The process is terribly onerous and not what my current 403b provider stated the process would be. Very unhappy and all to move just under $200 since the fees are so high anything I accrued over the last 20 years on my account was eroded away.
JACQUEZ WARD,I was able to navigate thru the directions easily
KATERINA ROGERS,Representative was very polite and helpful.
CRAIG BYER,"The lady I was on the phone with was wonderful. Extremely helpful, knowledgeable, and understanding when I was a little slow to pick up on some of the questions. She stayed on the phone with me and helped walk me through the entire process"

veronica,"I cannot get any beneficial feedback, just canned e-mail responses. I have been working on transferring and closing this account for over a year with no success and all I get is a run-around.I finally received assistance after publishing this review, but then it took three days to process the transaction! And it will take another three for funds to transfer. NOT a satisfied customer…"
Sade Edmonds,Excellent prompt service. Glad I stumbled across them.
Brookelynn Weatherholt,"Absolutely frustrated and upset over being unable to get a copy of the last statement.  I'm old (81) and terrible with a computer.  I tried - was on line about 40 minutes, and unable to do it because I'm an idiot with tech stuff.  So, I phoned.  Gave the lady all the information she asked for - last 4 digits, full name, address, date of birth, which company did the 401K originate from, etc. and she still wouldn't let me have the statement. Now have to wait for her to send me a verification form to complete and mail back to her.  When that's received, they'll send the last statement to me.  How long will all that take?  About 10 days?It is shocking that you cannot cater better to old people.  This is a very small 40lK - just about $3,000, and nobody is interested in helping me.  Shame on you."
JAMES GUOBIS,"Excellent customer service-genuinely  patient, nice, and helpful!"
NICK FRANCOIS,They gave me the information I needed to get back on tract with my trust account.

Corey Gross,MTC takes very long to reply to the process that they themselves have instituted for private placement. I have submitted all the paperwork 7 days ago and their response time is 3 days as published by them and they have still not responded.

TERRICA JOHNSON,The representative answered my question and provided me with how to follow up with next steps.
Odessa Goins,"I was following the directions in the letter to create my account.  On the information web page the listed address needed a slight correction.  The page would not proceed to the next page.  I called to speak to a representative.  As they were looking onto the issue, I simply returned to the create account tab and I was able to complete the process.  The rep I was speaking with came back on and I was able to explain that I had the issue resolved."
Cynselie Selifis,"I received an email from this company that I was not familiar with and thought immediately; this is a SCAM. But I am so glad that I continued to verify and confirm their legitimate existence and once I spoke with a representative, I was so glad that I didn't give up.  When speaking to the representative, he asked the appropriate questions that had nothing to do with what I had planned to ask and was able to assist me immediately.  If he had answered my questions first we would have spent useless time on the phone.  Thanks Millennium Trust!"
Lauren Jimenez,Representative was rude at answering questions. I explained I do not know the process and need it help with it.
KURT TEITSCHEID,"I was charged over $200 for processing my 401k disbursement. They charged me the $100 which is my future year’s fee for handling, and $100 for closing my account since my disbursement was $2700 the balance of my 401k before taxes. They justified by saying I was late paying. So they took me coming and going. I have now paid a fee for next year AND I’ve paid for closing the account. I tried explaining too that I had sent a check to them and Hard Assets each at the same time. Hard Aseets received theirs fine but Millenium never cashed theirs. I asked Celina, my contact for this transaction, twice, for reconsideration of taking all of these fees, but she never responded. I think what they did is horrible. That’s why I give them a one."
MARIA CHAVEZ,"Millennium Trust received a transfer of pension-related funds belonging to me about which they did not notify me over the past 10 years plus. The institution that provided the pension did not contact me either to indicate that they money would be transferred to Millennium Trust. Millennium Trust has been charging me a maintenance fee since receipt of my money. Upon learning about these funds, I contacted them ten days ago to initiate the process for transferring the money into a 401K. They instructed me to complete a form and wait for a follow up email from them to continue and conclude the transfer process. I have yet to receive anything from them (except for this comment request). Significantly, I also do not know whether or not they will refund the maintenance fees they extracted, because they did not bother to obtain an updated address for me. It seems that the process should not be so opaque and sloppy, and I am disappointed that with their fiduicary responsibility, they did not make any effort to contact me about my pension fund."
Padam Rai,"Kate ,was very helpful and answered all my questions.  She was a tremendous help ,very knowledgeable, courteous,  and friendly."
DIANE FORD,Quick and easy withdrawal I appreciate your service!
Margarita Apolinaris,Was easy and gast
AYSENUR GUMUSTEKIN,"My former employer's 401k went to these guys by surprise, which put this relationship off to a bad start. This was compounded by the circular references provided by the site's support platform, directing users to call a number, which then referred users back to the same website, where users were directed back to the phone number for support. The documentation provided in lieu of actual support is unclear and vague."

DUANE GASKINS,"I was not satisfied because my concerns were not met. I ended the call just were I started, lost and confused. Period."
AHMADRA DUNCAN,"Revised: Millenium trust made this right and removed the fees from this.Former company transferred IRA to them, just signing up so that I can withdraw funds to account gets a $30 ""Annual"" fee charge, then you get charged another $25 for closing the account.  Talk about being FEE Heavy....Companies should have to be required to get written authorization before ever moving any employees money at any point in time.  Not blanket consent, legitimate 30 days notice."

ALEXANDER BROWN,"The person I spoke to was pleasant at a 5 star level. However, I have not seen any favorable action taken on my request since -- a 0 star level. You do the math. Being pleasant is good for business. A non-action response is only shooting the business in the foot. Please take action on my request!"

CRYSTAL PADILLA,"Associate was friendly, professional, patient, and knowledgeable of the process."

ELMER,The process to withdraw the IRA amount was easy and smooth
JOE GARRETT,"It has taken about 2 years of back and forth to get my account transferred to ex spouse. He’s made calls and so have I. Paperwork has been completed and sent in and we are still working on it. After at least 4 calls, I was told last week I need to register the account and accept it so I can pull a statement and send it to him. First time I was told that. The attorney working on all of the assets transfers completed all the other ones within a few months and gave up on this one. No wonder. Ridiculous service"

Hannah Hergert,Easy to use!!!
Brandy Blevins,Thank you for your help.
BRIAN HELTON,I got this Ira when I left a company that I had a 401k with. I have not really messed with the account for years. So I logged in after years to see that my mo ey has gone down due to fees upon fees. This is not what I expected when I had my 401k put into this IRA. How can I get ready for retirement when the company is just going to continually fee my account down to nothing.
CARY FINUCANE,"I wanted to do a simple rollover electronically, instead I have to submit paperwork.. there is zero reason for this in 2022.  Also $30 paper statement fee is egregious, especially considering I was given paper statements as a default, I absolutely would have elected E-statements.  Also a $25 account closing fee.. no respectable  company charges this. Shameful."
Valtra Harris,The gentleman that helped me and my wife was very kind and knowledgeable. He helped with all of our needs and helped us better understand our options
BRIAN STONE,Seems like a great investment.  I needed the money for an emergency and I recieved it in a timely manner.  I will use you in the future

SOPHIA NOOR,"Millennium bought out my 401k from my old job and then decided to start charging me for having my money. The process of rolling over to my current employers plan was not great and the website is not very user friendly.Edit:As a reply to Millenium below. Just because it's legal, doesn't mean it's ethical to touch my hard earned money. I entrusted this money to the previous 401k plan, not you. I don't agree with the practice. That being said, I'm happy someone reached out to me via a phone call to explain. I'll give 2 stars."
JAMIRAQUA JONES,Super easy to get my money!
YAYAH KROMAH,What causes the two ira’s to be disbursed one  within minutes I’ve been waiting over a week for the second one of $150. What you’re also neglecting to say is when she reached out to me I spoke to four people prior who did not tell me that information. The customer service rep did not have a mastery of the English language. When I kept asking her not to extend the false pleasantries she kept doing that. Maybe you need to train your representatives better to explain the situation that would’ve been solved that day
Big D Larry,"Very helpful, five stars"

B wright,"I became a Mtrust customer by default when a former employer sent my 401k there. I tried to complete the onboarding process. It's stuck on the submit for review page of onboarding since i started the process in April, it's now August. After getting kicked out of chat every time I asked for an Agent, I decided this is not a company  I'd trust with my money. I've since had Fidelity to request a rollover. At least I will have access to my money now. I would not reccomend Millennium Trust for anything at all."

Fast forward 3.5 years nada zero nothing from them . All they care about is money or the amount of it that's why I just cashed it out and went elsewhere.
Cerise Ripps,"Everytime I request a partial distribution from my RA it takes a long time to get the money.  I get jerked around each time I call to check on the status of the check.  This last time it was approved and ready on 8/5/2022 and I requested otvto be expedited to me.  I called Tuesday 8/9/2022 was told it wasn't expidited and sent regular mail.  I was told that since zI asked for it to be expedited I could pay 30.00 fee to have a stop payment on the check already sent and the new check would be mailed on 8/9/2023 overnight to me.  Here we are on Wednesday 8/10/2022 and still no money.  I explained I dont request this unless itvis an emergency but no one and I mean no one cares.  They have no sense of urgency for anyone.  They are dealing with other peoples money and livelihood and whether or not they have power, water and food to eat and they dont care.  I would not recommend this company to anyone as they have helped me none and cost me a fortune in life events."

LESLIE COOK,4 star only because we needed the funds right away so in actuality we didn't have time to experience Millennium Trust but I can tell you it was easy and efficient and within a few hours we had forms signed online and money deposited directly into our account in 2 days. The website was easy to maneuver and easy to understand. Hopefully in the future we can do business again.

Arthur,I received notification that my previous employer rolled over my retirement funds to this company. I looked up the reviews and was automatically scared. I tried to have the funds transferred online and got stuck. I called customer service and got transferred to Juanita. She stayed on the call with me while i completed the forrm (even when i took some calls since it was in the middle of my work day). She told me to expect the money in 1-2 business days. The money was in my account in 2 hours. I was really in a financial bind and couldn't believe this came in at the perfect time. Thank you so much Juanita for your patience and words of encouragement. Deeply appreciated.
NIROSHANI KARUNARATNE,"Maddening process to get a power of attorney established for my Dad's account over the last 6 months of sending multiple documentations,FINALLY today was cleared and i was able to access the account and get the tax document.  The phone tree system works but be patient. Personal assistance is the best"
JORGE RIVERA,"The worst company for your finances ever. Reps refused to answer basic questions and weren't very friendly.

Harprit Chhabada,I had a low dollar amount invested for a short stint at an employer before I rolled over to my current employers’s plan. Granted it was invested for no more than 2 years but I never saw any gains and instead saw my balance decrease as a result of annual and administrative fees. I do appreciate them reaching out after my original review.
THOMAS ABRAMS,User-friendly website . Had to make some changes to my account and the process was extremely easy.Few months ago when I needed to make changes and get information on my account I had to contact Millennium Trust And everyone I spoke to was very helpful and informative.
ANNETTE HUGULEY,I NOT RECIVE  YET MY  MONY SUPOSTUBY I RECIVE  IN 2 DAYS I WANANOW WAT HAPPEN  THANKYOU
Richard Young,"A balance from a previous employer’s 401k rolled over into a Millennium Trust IRA without my knowledge. No one can explain to me why the balance remained in the 401k in the first place (I rolled the account over 3 months after separating from my previous employer and 10 months before the current balance was transferred to MT). I filled out paperwork prepared by my bank to transfer from MT to my preferred IRA, but I’m receiving email messages that claim there’s not sufficient information to perform the rollover (including missing my signature—which I absolutely signed). MT’s web portals are buggy and poorly designed. Phone and chat “support” is really geared toward providing no support at all (or at least only functionality that is already available in other formats). When I was able to speak with an agent, they were helpful. However, the automated menu systems are obstructive, actively discouraging me from trying to talk with an agent. Basically, I’m giving MT $30 to complicate my life with adminstrata that should have been settled months ago."
Joseph Whitley,Account transferred to MT and not easily transferred to other main account.  Excessive fees for maintenance?  Fees for printed statements.
DENNIS BRUGGEMAN,"Very professional, quick response."

BLANCA BAQUERA,"My former employer rolled my account over to Millennium Trust. In order to claim my account I was required to provide a great deal of personal identifiable information as well as my email address and phone number. Millennium did not send a code in response to the phone verification. Consequently, I had to jump through additional hoops. After this horrible experience, and in a separate transaction on the same day, I received a message stating that requested information was not received, when in fact I submitted this information twice. If Millennium is relying on technology, the technology needs to be operational. I spent far too much time on this site. Far, far too much time."
Cherie Connelly ,Both young men that assisted me when I called were very patient and helpful.
JENNIFER,Great amazing

JULIA URCUYO,"I was directed here through Beagle, they found an old 401k I didn't know about, and the process of accessing those funds and transferring them to Millenium trust was a relatively simple, fast, and easy process. I've already begun to spread the word of their outstanding service and user friendly process. I will continue to recommend their services going forward to anyone who is interested in better managing their retirement accounts."
Dane Rudd,The wait time was rather long but the person that helped was very knowledgeable and understanding.

SUSAN HOWEY,"The representative I spoke to was very kind. I don’t remember her name, but she was a great help."
Cheryl Berger,"Millennium Trust is like ""The Last Jedi"" of financial companies - somehow it has good ratings with the BBB and such, like ""The Last Jedi"" had good reviews from critics, but the customer/viewer experience seems to be waaayyyyyy different. This company has been slowly draining my account with fees for years, and makes it so hard to actually move MY OWN MONEY out of their stranglehold that I've started the process and given up several times (their intent, I'm sure, with the convoluted processes and iffy customer service).Do yourself a favor and if your company puts your retirement into their care, get out as quickly as you possibly can."

JENNIFER MCGLOCKLIN,"First off never asked for my money to be given to some company ive never heard of, considering the last company that managed my money only lost my money. So i try to get my money sent to me. The original company tells me since my previous employer closed the 401 k plan my money was sent to your company. They gave me ur phone number, so i called get told to get my money i have to use a web portal and create an account juat to withdraw my money. Try to create an account tells me my information is wrong or no account. So i called again woman said oh there is a typo on ur personal info. Wont tell me what the typo is just that i have to fill out another form updating there records so once i get an email back that it was updated i can create an account then.

VICTOR BERRY,Making a withdrawal request is very simple and straightforward.
MARIA FLORES,Terrible experience. Cust service phone number totally useless; took 10 mins of button pushing and listening to music to get to a human being.

Llewellyn Daguro,"This company lags in the area of electronic transfers.

Charged a fee to send me a postcard telling me a had an account, charges $35 annually, charges for mailing paper, but never once sent a letter until last week.— later: After calling about this, they agree to “investigate” the issue and submit a request to return these fees after my info rolled over from a different trustee. I was told to wait a few days and saw nothing change in my account. Only after I left this review did I get a voicemail three days later from Pauline telling me they’re waiving my fees and pressuring me to write another review. I then get another call from another person pressuring me again, very vehemently, to write a new review before they actually did what they said they would do. If you have an account that rolled over, I would remove my funds immediately. They skirt the lines of ethics and rely on shady, near duplicitous tactics to maintain any sense of a reputation."
Thomas Martin Ziermann,Wonderful customer service provided. Was able to get all the help I needed.

Juliandra Scott,"I have been trying to 'work' with Millenium Trust for two months now, to simply transfer cash from two custodial accounts over to an equivalent account on their platform. I've worked with a couple other custodians and this is typically filling out the appropriate forms and then waiting for the transfer to happen - that's not the case with Millenium Trust. I have many HOURS invested in filling out forms on their web site and then following-up to make sure they act on them, only to be sent the same forms via hardcopy (sometime 2 or three times) as if I hadn't filled them out already. Then, following-up on the new forms because no action takes place from there....and wait, and wait and then follow-up again. Trying to get a human on the phone there is a chore because they have automated menus that try to deter human contact - be it phone or chat. Trying to get simple beneficiary information entered properly was another matter - again, fill out their only form and then they complain that I need to fill out this 'other' form because I had submitted a trust, which I had not and I made that clear to them three times. Add to the tab three or four follow-ups to get them to fix both my beneficiary accounts because they either didn't act on my wishes or didn't act as indicated on the form. I  think Millenium Trust probably have good people working there, but their processes demonstrate a culture of ineptitude and I'm perplexed why Fundrise is requiring I work with them for custodial services because I'm not going to move any more of my retirement funds into Millenium Trust - life is too short to have to micro-manage my account custodian and since they are responsible for my retirement funds, that is of grave concern to me."
Kirk Hamilton,Representative was knowledgeable and helpful
BRANDEN ALTON,It was fast and easy operation. The site is easy to use
MARK HANDLER,Needed assistance logging in. Agent helped me quickly and efficiently.
FOREST GWYN,"I called on Tuesday, July 26th and spoke to Fellipie Coto.  He was so helpful and very nice. Fellipie helped me register my account online, and patient through the process because my laptop froze at one point. But we were able to do what was needed.  I was frustrated with my ex-employer in regards to my pension. Fellipie was understanding and helped me to do what i actually wanted done.  Great experience!! Fellipie was very professional."
Linda Hakim,My previous company rolled over my401k to this company. Feels pretty predatory that I had to open an account and pay an account closure fee to transfer my IRA to my custodian of choice instead of them just releasing my 401k. The staff was helpful but seemed over their job and lacked enthusiasm. The fees are high and can’t wait to get my funds out of their possession.
ANGELA RICE,My former employer quickly rolled over my 401k to Millennium Trust. Millennium Trust had my money for less than a month and charged me $50 in fees. I had to wait for my new plan to get setup and to accept rollovers. UPDATE: Millennium Trust issued me a rollover check for $50 to cover the fees. Adding one extra star.
Sabrina,Hope I did this alright because with this extra dollars I'm jus in a lil jam with some of my Bills.

They lost almost a third of my money and made the rollover back into my 401k annoying difficult. They wouldn't even send the check directly to my retirement account.A few days after I made this review they started calling me over and over. I think they were trying to get me to change my review, because they kept giving excuses."

Vince Borromeo,"The prompts were simple to follow but I still had a question and Amber in Alabama was thorough, considerate and patient in explaining my options and Millennium Trust's policies."
LAUNAH PHILLIPS,Your website is not user friendly. I’ve had to switch from my cell phone to my laptop and vise versa to try to get anything done. I’ve gotten to pages that wouldn’t let you go forward and when you clicked on anything it would log you out and you’d have to start with a code and entering the same information.

Great work!!"

ALICIA LENZNER,I do not have much interaction with company. That is why i give a neutral rating.
SARA V,"Millennium was good to work with for distribution of my account funds, they were distributed timely and the site was easy to complete for that. However it did not make sense to me why my balances were so low after almost 4 years. There was no real explanation and not understandable as to why one balance was only $1600 and the other only $50."
KANG SUN,Perfect timing
Ms powell,"I received a great customer service today from millennium trust and I can’t complain, keep up the good job guys"

TEE,"Called in for a simple change and was transferred to multiple people, had to repeat the same information over and over, was put on hold over 10 times, and now I need to wait and verify the change was actually made! Very frustrating. A waste of my time. In addition, for a relatively small investment, I was charged $30 in service fees. I will be moving my money ASAP!! Not worth the time. And no excuse to be charging a $30 annual fee for students who are starting out with a small amount."
Adam Oller,"It was so easy using your online, no hassle.  Thanks for everything"
TOKASA ADANANDUS,"My experience with Millennium Trust has been pretty good thus far. Taking into consideration that my funds have only been entrusted to Millennium Trust (MT) for about a week thus far, but from the looks of things, security is of the utmost importance which is a refreshing comfort. On the other hand, the availability, or should I say, the liquidity of  funds seem to suffer as I noticed a few unnecessary steps in what I would consider simple, or mundane procedures. Procedures simple in terms of MT's attempt to obtain my hand written signature which, from my estimation shouldn't require a series of up to 4 different emails, between 3 parties to include at least 1, possibly 2 phone calls. Only time will tell, but I can say 1 of the 2 customer service agents I've spoken to (Kate. D) has been extremely helpful & pleasant, as she was very knowledgeable, & her attention to detail was unusually high and in sync with her professional, yet courteous demeanor. With that said, the 2nd representative,being the bearer of said unnecessary steps, and being knowledgeable of his tasks' needlessness, soldiered down the same path as his predecessor, in skill as well as in effort."
Becca,"I called with questions about transferring my account and logging into my account. I spoke with Tim. He was professional, helpful, and efficient."

TALIA LAWRENCE,Great experience easy access and great instructions
Nicole Williams,"I spoke with 3 representatives 3 different times and all 3 were not inviting in the way they spoke to me. They were not positive or welcoming in their delivery and they did not wait to listen before they spoke, one representative kept speaking over me, so of course she couldn't hear what I was saying so I had to repeat myself severally. Another representative gave an option for delivery of funds while another kept telling there is no option except what was listed, which was confusing.  I was considering leaving my IRA with Millenium Trust but after speaking with them I decided definitely not to."
Carolyn Kupka,My review is the experience was great they was very nice very help fir and very quick to respond.

Kia Green,I spoke to a representative within 5 minutes she walked me through the process very carefully and resolved my situation promptly. I'm satisfied with the service.
APY,"My account was rolled over from previous employer. They give you a week to decide if you want to stay with them or move the funds over to another provider. However, a week is not long enough to complete the process of moving funds (and they don't permit electronic transfers.) I got slammed with the $30 maintenance fee AND a $25 account closure fee."
STANLEY ALTY,"The experience  was a little hard at first because I thought I had entered all information  but I didn't.

He had patience and took his time with me, I  really appreciated him for that."
Jonathan Foster,The website is very easy to navigate.  I think the best feature I've seen on webpages is the use of a tracking code.  It is so frustrating trying to explain to someone in customer service what it is you did online etc.

KAYLA RAINEY,Fees too high. Money would have been gone if I waited 40 years to withdraw. Totally worth paying penalty so this company isn't taking my money anymore.
Hunter,"I was totally lost. Totally. They walked me step by step through all my whole process. I really recommend Millenium. They go far and beyond to keep their clients satisfied.

KRISTINE CRAIG,Really great work by your representative. Helpful and thorough.

Dedrick  Kilman,The process was easy and quick for me to transfer my accounts.
MICHAEL VANATTA,"This is a follow up review. I was contacted by the company to explore the reasons for my initial 1 star review.  I feel like they really heard me and took every measure to help me resolve the issue by cashing out the 23 dollars that had been rolled over to them from my previous company AND they went way and above by not enforcing the $10 fee to do this. I wouldn't have expected this at all. Its their business and policy to receive funds for services rendered, but in this case I really feel they placed the person ahead of the business model. I can't thank them enough for their speedy and specific response making a bad situation for both us better"

JOHN VAUGHT,Don't try to get funds put into your account electronically...it will take an act of God to make this happen. Plan ahead of time if you need funds and ask for a paper check to be mailed to you...or suffer.

WILLIAM SCHARNWEBER,Fast response and customer service was very helpful
STEFANIE PEREZ,"Needed help with a rollover to my new employer. The process felt very confusing on my own, but I was able to get the appropriate guidance over the phone. Thank you!"
John Consumer Name,The representative didn’t listen to my concerns. She constantly repeated the same thing. I asked her how to fix my issue and it seemed as though her concern was the fact that I did something wrong. Very rude to a customer that’s asking for help and calling to fix things.

Emmanuel De Vera Soriano,You inform me that I have an account with you related to a transfer of my retirement account with a previous employer. I then have to go in and verify this with you giving out private information. This absolutely irritates me to no end as I have not received any notification from my former employer that this process is taking place and now I have fees that need to be paid to you to get this money transferred to my active IRA. I am very irritated with this process How do I know this is legitimate and not a scam.
Jaquilla Simpson,Excellent working with them. Easy access and not complicated to work their site.
Jessica Loera,"Millennium Trust worked very hard to track me down years after I had separated from my previous employer so that I could get in touch with my retirement account again.  When I decided to cash out my benefits, they had the money in my account the very next day.Pleasure to work with."

Vickie Ervin,"It was an ok experience.  Financially, it was great... saw some growth with some good investment options.The lack of support made it a little difficult to work with though.  It was easier to withdraw/close my account than it was to transfer the funds into a different account (which required printing/scanning).Also, the lack of a mobile app in this day & age also made it difficult."
MICHAEL KAYE,I wanted to close out my account and everyone I spoke to was very thoughtful and helped me thru the process.   I'm very grateful for the guideance and it was quick and their employees made it easy for me to understand what to do.
Tacious Gaygay,I appreciate the help I got from the company. I needed to withdraw early and I was suprized by the quick email response that came with simple instructions. It took a day or two for the money to show up in my account. I liked that I never had to contact them by phone.

MYRANDA STRICKLAND,Such an easy service and website to deal with it
N. G.,"Using MTC for an IRA investment in an alternative investment. This company's service is horrendous, truly the worst financial services company I have ever dealt with in 35 years of investing. I see that it is private; I assure you the owners aren't investing in the service side. Talking to a human is a phone tree ordeal, then you get people that literally don't know what they are doing. They can't transfer calls without dropping you, or you end up in another queue. The staff you do talk to seems new and unsure of what they are doing with paperwork. Want to escalate and talk to a manager - just forget about it, you won't live that long. Want a call back after leaving a message (*voice and email) - it hasn't happened after about 8 tries - not one return call or email. I have been trying to get a ""case"" worked for 4 business days. They have lost emails, asked repeatedly for the same things, and then made absolutely no progress. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY IF YOU CAN HELP IT."
Bertha AmescuaTrejo,No hassle account. I appreciate ease of accessing the account and navigating through the website.  Everything you need is easily accessible.

IAN,"I was trying to close my account with  KGB-Reit  and  I  didn't realize  that  the transaction  had to go  through Millennium.  My financial advisor had sent me the docusign emails but it was  sent back to the REIT account not your company. I just wish   communications from both companies had been upfront about your connection. I really  don't know who  is at fault for the confusion but it took two calls to you, one to the REIT company and two to my financial advisor to straighten this matter out."

RACHEL RAMIREZ,I submitted a form to receive a check on may 26th 2022It is 7-18-22 where is my check!!
NICHOLAS MATA,The company did not say anything except go create an account online. Did that almost a year ago. Now they need me to send in proof of who I am??? The fees are high and the service person I spoke with could use more management support with answers.
KAREN CLEMENT,All the fees that were associated with me getting my money back is ridiculous. I put money into my retirement to be able to have it and then it just gets rolled over to some kind of Ira thing that never even got money added to it. I won't refer anyone to y'all

JERRY CARR,Although Joanna came through in the end the overall experience was very much terrible.  The first few times I called I got terrible and rude representatives. One even hung up on me.  Wouldn’t do business with them if I had to.  I chased my money for months between the two agencies and both claimed they didn’t have it.   The only upside to experience with Millenium was Joanna herself.  She went above and beyond and gave me all the information I needed.  Her candor was refreshing and much appreciated.

I had just talked to ADP about an account I had there. Even through this confused information I was giving her, she was not flustered or upset with how long it was taking me to access my account. She walked with me from providing me the right website I should use to access my account, to updating my info, to password creation to my losing the information, to helping me get back to where I should be. She was EXCELLENT and deserves a pay increase. At least she should get a pay increase AND teach other customer representatives the correct way of handling a customer who needs to have her hand held to get through the system. I am 64 years old and have contacted hundreds of customer service representatives in my lifetime. She is one of best I have ever interacted with. Cudos to the person who hired her.

GAVIN HARRIS,Representatives were out of this world helpful. Thanks.

EBONI WOODARD,You got four stars because of the automated assistant. Had my experience only been with the real person that helped me you would have received 5 stars.

As we weren’t prepared for that at the time we slipped it, but could not find any opportunity to go back and submit it. We had to wait for an email response, which we had to ask for, and then we’re offered to send via email or fax.  Surprised that a financial institution would suggest sending a picture of an SSN card through unencrypted email."

The bank then took out many FEEs over 2017-2019 in an account that earned $2 in interest,  over $50 in fees were taken out.   Then i withdrew and the IRS is taxing me on the full amount because it got reported as a PENSION WITHDRAWL.i did NOT hang up on the attempted phone call.

MARY GROFT,Usually replies in a timely manner with precise direction and help
DAVID OCONNOR,called for info was told to hold for one hour not acceptable at all.
Christina Torres,"I’ve been trying to move an old 401k from Millennium Trust for basically 2 years now. Now, it has not been constant, but it’s taken so long because they make it so impossible to get anything done. They do not have online options and require paper everything even from the bigger companies. Their process is painfully unnecessarily long.They do not send regular information, I do not recall the last time I received an account overview or statement of any kind. They charge fees, which I am pretty sure if why they make it so impossible to get your money out of the account.Stay away, stay far far far away.Additionally, they only respond to comments who leave positive reviews, if that doesn’t speak volumes, I don’t know what does."

Carl,The automated answering system needs updated. I have spent 3 days trying to talk to someone. The staff ounce you get to talk to them are very helpful. Still trying to fix problem.
Beverly,Everything was lovely and manageable. Great response time!
DAVID KONOP,I got ripped off with all the fees so I withdrew my money and then another fee to closeout the account. This is the first place Ive had charge a fee for closing out my account. It seems as if its some sort of scam to make you decide to stay but with all the fees your account will go down to nothing. Wouldn't recommend this company.
Eduardo,"The representative was helpful and patient.  The company's account set-up is ABYSMAL.  Very few sign-up features actually work.  as you set up your account, the MFA steps for iphone users (I assume that these are many, by the way), suck.  I got duplicate verification codes, multiple times (and no - I didn't click the button more than once to generate a code).  I must admit that clicking the button twice to generate a code would have been an intuitive thing to do, as it took an UNREASONABLY LONG TIME for the code to be texted to the user (me).  Apparently, Millenium Trust is using an inferior, low-cost SMS provider with terrible latency.  So - fair warning:  if you have an iphone, and you seek to verify your identity using SMS, you will likely get TWO verification codes sent to you, one immediately after the other, but you will have to wait an inordinately long period of time to get these two codes.  The next, begged question is ""which code do I enter?"" Logic would suggest to enter the more recent code.  DON'T DO THIS - it will fail.  Enter the first code sent - this is the only way I was able to get it to work.  Do you see the picture here ?  UNACCEPTABLE - AMATEUR HOUR.  Don't do business with this company - there are many other, better options.  Overall - a very bad experience."

You have to get through the request of distribution form and be sure to have information available to upload at the end to complete request (ie: bank acct and ID verification).

GREGORY WHITE,"Requested a early withdraw that is suppose to take up to five business days to complete. It has been nine business days and no word. I called and spoke with an ""agent"" who was coughing loudly on the phone and didn't seem interested in helping much, she sounded very tired and bored. I let her know I was just checking, since, I had not heard anything. She told me it takes up to five business day to process, and that I just needed to wait. I informed her it had been past the process time by a few days and just wanted an update on the status. She seemed irritated and then placed me on hold for about ten minutes, only to get back on the phone and tell me they do not know the status of my withdraw or where it is during the process. She did inform me that her ""team leader"" sent an email out to the company to handle it immediately. Whether or not they actually sent any email, I don't know. I feel like they just wanted to get me off the phone. As of today, I'm still waiting on word of what's going on. I will more than likely pull my money out once I research a company I feel like might do better."

DANELLE DAVIS,"Great, fast service!"
IAN DEODAT,Great customer service
Isaac Mugo,"Not happy with this company, or at least their policies.  My accounts (Roth and traditional) were forced here by my old company, even though I asked for the funds to be sent directly to me.  I kept looking for the checks and finally called the prior custodian to inquire, only to find that the funds were sent here.  I called Millennium Trust to get the funds transferred back to me, and find out that it’s going to cost me $55 per account to move them, because their fee to close an account is $25 and their yearly maintenance fee is $30 and is charged immediately upon receipt of the funds.  I asked for a refund of the maintenance fee at least, because the funds had been there only about 20 days, and was cheerfully informed that they only refund that fee if the funds are there less than a week.  A week!!  It would take longer than that just to get them their required paperwork to transfer the funds.  Maybe that’s the intent of the policy, so they can collect frivolous charges for doing nothing.  So, I’m out $110 just for the privilege of having my funds at Millennium for less than a month!  Totally unsatisfactory and not customer oriented or customer friendly in any way.   So much for their statements about how their customers are so important to them. I certainly didn’t feel important or respected after this experience, and I certainly won’t be leaving my funds here or dealing with them again.**UPDATE**Terri reached out to me by phone and offered to refund some of the charges against my accounts.  Not all, but some at least, for which I was, and am, very grateful.  It was refreshing to experience customer service personnel who proved that they actually DO care about their customers.   I am raising my 1-star initial impression to 3 stars--average, because not all of the charges were refunded and I did have to complain first.  However, overall I am much more pleased with the end result--some refund is better than no refund, after all.  (I would have raised it to at least a 4-star had they refunded all charges since I never intended any of my funds to end up here.)Thank you, Terri, you're a rock star!!!"
AMANDA BROOKS,The young men over the phone was very helpful and understanding. He's explain everything so professional. Thank you for your kindeness
Soscha Angall,Lost 1/4 of my investment with no updates. Will not invest with them again
CODY,"Wonderful, trust worthy company. Would deal with again."
JEROLD WELLS,I got locked out of my account and it took calling 2 different times to get a distribution request. And the second time I was questioned and warned I was on a recorded line by the agent trying to say I was not me. Very unprofessional especially for a service I never signed up for and was charged a fee for. I believe this service is a rip off
Michael P. Thompson,"If you value your money and enjoy the ability to transfer your funds easily, DO NOT trust Millenium Trust.  Their primary goal is to charge you fees."
ROSE NIEVES,"The person who helped me  go through the online procedure was patient, helpful and smart. A very good experience"

Between their annual charges and transaction charges (I was wholly passive so these are all fees you can't help but incur), this company took so massively much more than my paltry retirement sum was earning that I was losing a lot of money to their crazy fee requirements.  Don't put your money here!!!!"

NICOLETTE BROWN,"Easy to use, fast, legit"
CHRISTIE KAUFMAN,Tim took care of me and was extremely helpful in informing me of the details of the process for withdrawing and was transparent about the fees and penalties. He was patient and kind in answering all my questions. Tim deserves a raise and a promotion! Thank you so much.
ALEXANDRIA SMITH,The customer representatives where very helpful at getting me to where I needed to be to withdrawal my funds from my ira. I can honestly say the only part of the process that I had an issue with was no one sent me a confirmation email after they had received my information so I could do the withdrawal
CHRYSTALEE HOLLIDAY,Very simple to do
Leo Roberts,"These folks were just a nightmare to deal with, from not being able to access my account for ~6 months to not getting my 2FA info updated for 2 months, finally just had it and closed my account which cost me $30.They do everything they can to deter you from contacting them too, don't believe me ?  Call their number and see how long it takes to get in touch with a human being.The most helpful person was the agent i spoke with to close the account, kudos to them, they probably have to take alot of those calls lol."
Thomas Sealock,"Worst service I have experience from a team so far. I have requested a distribution now twice and there has been no confirmation of movement forward when sending the required documents. Then when documents are requested again because I was not informed of incorrect documents there is no response again. It is entirely frustrating when you get on the phone to be told oh yes, your documents were incorrect and you need this form. Then fill out the new forms immediately to provide and get only the response the forms have been received and you will hear shortly.... I would love to have my money NOW!!"
ARNOLD BANKS,"Lewis was awesome!  he walked me through everything was on top of everything, knew what he was talking about.  I appreciate you!   Have a great day"
ANTONIO RYLAND,"I only needed to close out a small account, and she was very polite and helped me through my annoying senior moments! Thank you!"
GINA AGUIRRE,Great service and a one stop shop for retirement accounts
RENE NARCISSE,"The website was fast and easy to understand. Everything was fairly straight forward. Unfortunately, however, the phone number I was given to contact Millennium Trust had been disconnected which was very stressful considering that my former employer moved the account, not myself. It would have been great if there had been a recording when I called, giving your new phone number or simply referring callers to the website.I hadn’t heard of Millenium Trust prior to now, so your reputation was completely unknown to me. After filling out all the necessary information, there was a prompt stating that my identity needed to be confirmed and that it could take 2 - 3 businesses days. I received an email almost immediately, saying that my information was confirmed and I would be able to access my account. I began the process of moving  the balance to another financial institution. I received notice that it would take a few days to receive. The balance was in my other account by morning.Seriously, everything was great after the phone call. The site was well designed and easy to navigate. I absolutely would have rated 5 stars if not for the 15 or so minutes of not knowing where the heck my money was. For all I knew, you could have been a shell company that disappeared to a tropical island after taking a few million dollars of peoples retirement money 😂😂😂"
Jim,"Professional, courteous, prompt"
MARIA VALENZUELA,It was a great experience.  It was easy to use and the process was simple.
IRENE JENKOT,I had the best experience ever with the customer service here !!!!! I’ve never spoken to someone so helpful on the phone to walk me through all the steps to figuring this out. Thank you so much !!!!

WILFREDO VANTA JR.,It was very helpful the process through your website. It was very cleared and had no trouble. Thank you for a great experience.
BAILEY WALKER,I wanted to take a moment to let you know how much I appreciate the excellent customer service and assistance I received from Michelle Ott today. She was very patient and knowledgeable about the issue I was trying to resolve. I have been trying to roll over funds from an older IRA to my current 401K plan – and kept running into road blocks – some of them of my making. Michelle assisted in three separate ways to get my issue resolved: She walked me through logging in online – but it kept taking me to the wrong place.She sent me link and sat with me through entering the information and DocuSign – which initially did not work. She then sent me another link and we were successful in getting the IRA Rollover Request done.She also gave me the email address to send support documents to.I work in customer service all day. I know when someone is just “doing the job” and when someone really wants to help.  Michelle Ott really wants to help and showed not the littlest bit of impatience. She is a stellar example of being helpful and going the extra mile. She represents Millennium Trust Company well!
SAM PETERSON,"Called for help moving funds from them to my credit union. Called ask for real person and was put on WAIT!!  Opt for a call back,10-20 mins. After an hour stated over. Waited on the phone. While waiting I went to the website and tried to get in. All I got was a repeat of QUESTIONS asking to identify who I was. After one and a half hours I called again. This was a little more fruitful, I finally got a REAL Person. But he was not able to get me satisfied. I asked for a supervisor who finally showed me an end to my quest. I'm being sent my account numbers so I can transfer funds to my local account. If there was a lower rating I would give it. No phone call back, a website that gave little or no option then another 20 mins waiting to talk to a real person."
KAITLYN LOKEINSKY,Quick and Easy. The customer service agent stayed on the phone with me the entire time.
sara,Exceptional customer service from the representative who helped us out!

ANDREA JONES TARRER,Is not very pleasant. I am still in the process of dealing with them and wish it was over. Almost want to give them my money because they are making it so difficult to have my money I put into the fund. Do not recommend.
Lee,I would never open an account at this institution unless you want zero access to your money and no assistance from anybody in order to close your account and move your funds. They are robbing people and should be in prison.

Kathleen,"Millennium trust, parent company of Payflex. Payflex is the absolute worst most fradulent provider of FSA services in the US. Stay far away from Millennium trust. If they cannot even manage an FSA plan DO NOT TRUST THEM WITH YOUR IRA!!!!!! Payflex will deny all claims and refuse to pay YOUR money for YOUR healthcare. Payflex is horrible, look at their reviews, NOBODY is happy with their services and they are proudly owned by Millennium Trust, they need to be shut down!!!"
DARILIN MARIA,"July 27 update:  Yes, Terri called and she has been helpful. However, it has now been a month, you have all of the information you need to make the transfer. My advisor at Vanguard has been calling your team everyday and the response is “waiting for liquidation”. It’s a simple target retirement mutual fund. This doesn’t take that long. Until the transfer actually happens, I will continue to update this review. Jun 29: It has been a month and a half since I initiated a request to transfer my IRA to another account. After a lot of paperwork plus two follow-up calls, the money is still with them. I have no idea how to get my money out at this point because clearly even phone calls where they promised it will be taken care of had led to no action."
ANA VAZQUEZ PEREZ,"Transaction was fast, less than 2 days, my only suggestion is to write the terms of the contributions or withdrawals in a more simplistic way."
Tina,Very easy to communicate with. Appreciate their help
RICKY LEVINS,"So far so good, An employer I work for was bought out and they sent our 401k's to Millennium. Haven't invested yet but in the process of a distribution and it was easy enough so far."
CARLOS SALAZAR,very easy to use the online tool.  clear instructions and great utility.
Doc's wife,Representative was very pleasant and nice but we could not resolve the issue. She then sent the problem to the IT department but we still have not heard back and we still could not log on. So it's a 3. Had they gotten back to us and resolved the problem it could have been a 5.
JEFFREY DYMECK,Very efficient and polite.  Thorough- thanks for the ease of completing request.

DOMINICK BARRETT,"Hi,  had a great experience getting  help on a issue with an account hope to see email before the end of the day."
WAYNE VILLENEUVE,"The ability to do the withdraw online was very helpful and easy. I was annoyed by the $25 fee for withdraw when I already have to pay the 10% for taxes. I didn't want to withdraw the money, but we had an unexpected death in my family, so I had to do it. A $25 service charge is another ""nickel and dime"" process for customers."
G  Robinson,"The representative Kimela explained everything to me about my account. She had excellent customer service, very knowledgeable, and very helpful. She also sent me emails to review information as well. Kimela should receive an accommodation for her excellent customer service."

BRENDALIZ PARSONS,"I called because i requested a rollover in January of 2021 but just today received a letter in the mail that the request was not processed because of missing information.  The associate on the phone explained that there was a missing letter t from my other financial institution and explained that they notified them but never received a response....  He also explained how to get the transfer re-submitted.  At the end of the call, I also requested a refund of annual account fees since the original request.  He was VERY KIND to waive those fees for me.  So helpful and courteous.  10/10! 5 Stars! give that man a raise!  Thank you so much!!!!"
JOSELINE OYOMIRE,"In all honesty, I had no idea I had this account until I was contacted by them. Withdraw process and easy and efficient. Highly recommended financial services."
MARK DECARIO,They were extremely helpful and the website was very easy-to-use and it explained what I needed to do step by step and what penalties and or restrictions I needed to be aware of and handling all the tax related issues and keeping me updated on my account when I had forgotten all about it I thank them much
Isauro Salvador,My former employer chose you. I haven’t had the time to review your company of make the choose myself. Then charge $25 for closing an account I didn’t open.

CAROLYN,"It was easy, fast,and efficient."
Charles Shrader,"Your services have become much easier since my former employer transferred my savings to this account a number of years ago and the site was easy to navigate. While I did have to wait a while to talk to a representative to make sure my transaction was finalized, she was very helpful and explained everything to my satisfaction."
Tejal Patel,Well 1 my name is spelt wrong on the email for this review. 2 I started on my distribution early June I was on the phone with Kevin who told me everything was good and all I need to do was send a voided check. Then after the so-called 5 days to review I haven’t received anything so I was worried with having to send a voided check. So I called and I was told my distribution was started but not completed. So after waiting 5 days already now I would have to finish it and wait another 5-7 days for my distribution. Which I needed it days ago and if I didn’t call I would of knew known no one sent a email or called about it. Again just told me after I filled everything out to send a void check and that’s all I needed to do. But when I called back after not receiving anything in my account I talked to a lady who set on the phone with me made sure I got the email and walked me through everything. That’s why I gave a 2 star because that lady was VERY helpful but the experience and lack of communication and still to this day having to wait longer for my distribution is why I rated so low. So hopefully I get it soon.
SUSAN ATWELL,Transferred my Roth IRA to my current 401k and all was done online. Pretty smooth. Thanks for your help.
JASMINE CLICK,"worst place to have your money held, depleted my money to almost zero.very unfair. Where your money is just depleted with no information. NO warning!!"
SELENA WILLIAMS,"BEWARE, I would never ever ever invest or put my money into this company.  Their Fees are exorbitant and they make it hard for you to roll over into anything else outside of Millinenium Trust.  I lost sooo much money on my 401k in fees."
MHINES,"Thankfully, I was connected to a very patient and helpful representative. She stayed with me to help me complete an entire form. Sorry I did not write her name down. Thanks again."
JACQ,"The application to withdraw your funds from the IRA are too complicated. Not the form itself but what comes after. Ive had to do about 4 applications and anytime I email the company i just receive  an automated answer back. Apart from that I've been trying to withdraw my funds now for a month. You also get bombarded by emails even if they don't apply to you. I have sent for my identity to be verified 4 times now, but i still get emails saying to send documents to verify my identity. The videos that the company refers you to, is outdated and doesn't look anything similar to what the website looks like now. At no point when i email the company  does it seem I'm receiving  actual  responses  from another human being."
GORDON DUNCAN,I had a very small IRA that I decided to cash in. I went to the website and it was very easy to do everything online.
FLORENCE RANSOM,It's very difficult to work with this company. Not so cooperative.

MARSHA,Really nice staff
JESSICA MEFFORD,Had to call to see how to access my account online. Otherwise it was okay
ABRAHAM CURRY,I called the phone number because I was having problems with accessing my account online. They sent me a link told me to fill out the application and I still cannot access my account.

EMILY FORESTAL,"Fast response, quick results."

Jesse Farley,"Once I got to the right person, they quickly guided me through the process. The funds arrived promptly. Bravo!"

SHUNKITA MORALES,The representative I spoke to was wonderful and went through every piece of paper with me to make sure I had everything correct
TARA NASTA,The company representative was polite and efficient.  I did not know that you can not request disbursement on two accounts electronically.  On your second account you need to allow the first account distribution to be processed.  He helped by sending paper forms that I completed in docusign withe a picture of your current DL and send back.  Excellently serviceLeanne
All well,"My only complaint is that in order to consolidate my funds to 1 account at Fidelity, Millennium asks me to get Fidelity to send them the rollover form. Seems like that puts the onus on me.  Otherwise very nice, responsive and professional."

SALIM SAAB,"Great service and easy to work with, will be coming back"
Ljud,"While the call initially tried to direct me to a self help line, I was in short order provided access to a very courteous live agent who proved incredibly helpful and thorough.

Zechariah Cowles ,Nothing happened just I don’t have too much time to control my account if it was app that will be easier but thanks
SArahd,"Been trying to get my money from here and was told 5 days. We are on day 7 now and nothing.  The people here don't help, they lie and you have to fight like he to get YOUR money that was sent here from another company that I did not authorize.  Looks like I need an attorney to get my money back. I absolutely do not recommend this place."
MOLLY RUNYON,"The process of withdrawing funds was simple and straight forward, the funds transfer to take place five working days after the withdrawal request."
FERN OVERLAND,The agent was on point with what to do and how to get things done.Thank you
Shanti,I’m not sure I think the process is over if so it was extremely smooth it went well
STEVEN ASHLEY,"Your phone associate is the reason this is not a negative star review. She was great, knowledgeable and let me know what I had to do to get my money out of this account. I did not elect to have millenium take over my accounts. And I SHOULD NOT have to pay to get MY money out of your account. I did NOT consent to the $30 fee you imposed on each of my accounts and I MUST consent to $25 per account to get my money where I want. This is NOT the way to gain clients."
Frankie Gotcher,Good service but not done yet the service now I can I give 5 stars
CHARLES WITTENBRAKER III,I did not receive the materials I requested. This information was to be used to deposit my check that is currently gathering dust in my house. I needed information confirming the amount that is pre-tax so I can send it to my 401K provider.

She did, and I finally was able to successfully get the process started. I should receive my funds on a card in about 2 weeks or so. She was the best of help in every step. Thanks!"
DENNIS MAGOON,Terrible customer service.. quit reading from a script and listen to what your customer is saying that way your not asking a question looking for an answer that he just told you
JAMES BRANSCUM,"I had a myriad of questions about my account. how to manage online, how to make a withdrawal and what would the ramifications be, if any, how it affects my age, taxes, etc.  The representative was VERY PATIENT with me and even though we were conversing over the phone, she made me feel very comfortable and I could see and hear her smile over the phone.  She has the patience of Job!  I appreciate her assistance and am grateful to now have a full understanding of the services that are available to me.  Thank you."

PATRICIA HENRY,The website was very difficult to use due to it crashing repeatedly. Otherwise everything else was a very smooth and easy transaction.
SUSY KIENTZ,Michelle did an amazing job in providing me with assistance to resolve my matters. Simple and easy. Promotion i think
CALANDRA COX,I called & was told I needed to log in to take a distribution. It is ridiculous that a real person cannot help me. Then I log in & find out that it is going to take several days for the system to verify my identity which is ridiculous. My wife works in the financial industry & she has never heard of people not having access to their money. It’s unlawful.
KILIAN OKORO,The agent did a great job helping me with all my answers.
racqstar100,"Trustworthy, and easy to set up account, easy access, I recommend 100 percent."

TIWANA GRIFFIN GREEN,Great company!This was the easiest process ever! I was able to complete everything online with no hassles or issues. I would definitely work with them again!!
LONNA CHRISTENSEN,I cannot get ahold of anyone to help me with my account. I waited 15 minutes on hold to speak with someone. When someone did answer she put me through the automated service again. I tried it once more thinking it was a mistake but it happened again. My issue is a little different than the 3 options they give you on the automated system. Really disappointed in the lack of customer service.
CESAR SANCHEZ,I have sent emails regarding my account they haven’t been answered! Poor customer service!
Cece,"Easy to navigate and use, and I had no issues."
DAVID SCHWARTZ,"Other than multiple confirmations of my identity(I get it, and appreciate it) the transaction was relatively quick and easy!Direct deposit into my account took less than 24 hrs to appear! Would definitely recommend!"
Ms K,First rep I spoke with was not clear and concise with instructions
RICHARD GEREAU,Great service Fast and friendly staff Highly recommend
Quornflour,It was easy to use and get your money really fast. Only thing I don't like they took money out of what was in 401 when moving it to this bank. So my best option was just to take it out and not look back.
Harold Pedersen,Received my retirement letter. Contacted the company and Joanna was a big help in explaining the process. Received my disbursement within 2 days.

Sareoub lay,"I didn’t realize my company had moved a small amount of money to them and the service fee to retrieve it is ridiculous.  No negotiation, just “too bad for you” attitude."
NICOLE DETTMERING,"Smoothest, easiest transaction I’ve ever had with a 401k company!!"
MEGAN ROCKER,"A very easy, yet a very thorough process. It is about as bulletproof as can be."
LUIS PORTILLO,I have only used the site to withdraw and transfer. I like the options provided when making transactions and how user friendly the site is.
Brick,"In beginning I tried to log on to my account couldn't figure it out tried calling and not real helpful. Once I got on my account finally, couldn't make since of any of it. My stuff would have been pulled a long time ago if I have found a good helpful place like I have."
SHELCIE HOLBERT,The service that we had was fabulous.  The young lady answered every question we had an told us what we need to do.
Thomas Moore,Service was exactly what I expected - thank you
DALE FORREST,They were very helpful
BAL SINGH,Very good helpful there wasn't any time issues with my request
CRYSTAL JOHNSON,I got off the phone feeling like I was an idiot. I am not. Customer service should not make me feel that way. She knew her job and had the lingo. That doesn’t mean it should be used in a manner to speak over my head. I will probably move my money out once my financial planner gets the statement that she is supposedly sending me.
ERICA KRATZER,Site is difficult to use and figure out how to close account that I never opened. Dont like how I am charged to shut down said account as well.
ROMAN YOUNG,"Very helpful and polite customer service. There was a bit of a delay getting a representative, but it was worth it. My problem was resolved."
CHOCO GBOMINA,"Dealing with Millennium Trust was so easy and details were explained on what to do and what to expect. It was so fast, I didn’t  actually expect everything to be settled, received and done so soon. I’m thankful and greatful for the excellent service. Maria Cruz"
Vanusa Greene,Thank you for processing a quick transaction for our time of need.
TINA TOBIAS,I needed a withdrawl and the site and rep made it easy. I received funds in couple of days. I like them.
CHRISTOPHER SMITH,"Great and easy experience and communication. I love the direct info in the mailing, I was able to understand and get the REAL help I needed even with the automatic voice system and online. It was so well explained and I felt supported without ever speaking to anyone literally."
KIMBERLY BRANDS,Pretty straight forward service. Just a pain to try and actually talk to anyone
STEFANIE GRIMSLEY,I worked with another Financial Institution that transferred it over via phone.  This is a complicated company to work with.
JOYANN PORTER,Trying to get my funds transferred to my TSP and the process is annoying and is a lot of waiting. I just want the money that is mine and I do not understand why the process is so complex and takes weeks to do. I bet it’s just so you can collect all the annual fees and make money off the money I earned. # greedy
TERRELL GEDDIE,"Bruce was extremely patient and helped me out a lot,"
VANESSA GLOVER,Proactive company they made sure where my money was at and let me receive it no questions asked.
ANNA NUNEZ,Service is exceptionally beyond my expectations. The portals are easy and user friendly as well. I am very satisfied with all of the experiences I have had.
Carol Beld,"Dj and Jessica were so patient with me, I am “young”not very knowledgeable in anyghing that involves a 401 k they walked me through paperwork and very kind and AMZING CUSTOMER SERVICE !"
MIROSLABA RIVERA SANTANA,Linda was beyond helpful.  She was very knowledgeable with patience of a saint.    Thank you Linda for all your help.
MORGAN STOTT,"You can not say you care at all about your customers while having a website as awful as the one you have is. It’s not user friendly at all, it has terrible auto fill for information. It tried to prefill my email address and other personal information and did it completely wrong. I was planning on just keeping this account open; but the website alone is so bad I decided to just take a distribution and close my account. If I could give 0 stars I would. Your company sucks."
STEVEN MEEK,I had to call 4 times and no one was actually able to help me.
ALI ALNAFAAY,"Worked with Sandra Cruz on rolling over an IRA account from another plan and she was magnificent!  Great patience and professionalism on her part!  Thank you, Sandra!"
BENJAMIN MAYBERRY,"The rep I spoke with was knowledgeable, friendly and above all patient.Good job 👍🏾"

AMBER H,Today I started the process of distributing and withdrawing funds from an old IRA from my first job in high school that I had previously had trouble accessing (different account management company). Millennium Trusts' online portal and customer service made the process of accessing my account and information extremely easy and straightforward. I also felt as as though the online process had a lot of great security features and verification steps that made me feel as though my information was safe and my account was protected. Thanks for your help in this process. I would highly recommend this company for any IRA or other retirement account management services.

The Support Page says leave a message and we will get back to you. I left 2 messages there and 1 message to the email address  on a correspondence they sent to me. I get the feeling they have too much business and just do not care.
AMERIS WYATT,Terry was so helpful and friendly! Couldnt have asked for a better experience. Thank you Terry!

Went online and they verified my identity quickly and when I chose the option to cash out, the funds were in my account within hours. I use Chase so that's likely why it was so quick. I assume smaller banks may have issues or delays."
CRAIG LAFUSE,Rollover into Current Employer's 401k.Jillian was very helpful and stayed with me on the call while contacting Millenium Trust Company to rollover my Traditional Roth IRA into my current employers' 401k Plan in order to confirm the details of the rollover were properly recorded.
M. Collini,Horrible experience with this company.  They make it very difficult to withdraw your money. They require you to upload a voided check. I've never used a check in my life.  I called in and the customer service representative rudly hung up on me.  Avoid this company at all costs.

GIVAN MARIN,All my questions were answered and received excellent help. Thank you.
TAMMY VICKERS,Whenever I want to do an IRA Rollover with Fidelity or TD Ameritrade it is a simple easy process that is done in a few days. When I try to do this with Prosper/Millenium it is a multi-month process. Each time I try to do a transfer it seems to be a different process where I am going through Prosper and Millenium and it is even a fight to get through the password as it is unclear which sign-on I need to sign into.
Rod King,I found the website to be a little challenging.  I was able to accomplish what I needed.
Krayos,"Super easy to set up account on website. Very helpful staff answering questions, Josie and Arusha. Wish I could have kept account active but needed to cash out."

At the time, it was 10-15 minutes but I ended up on hold for 40 minutes and hung up, called back waited another 30 minutes and hung up, then another 10 minutes.  And now they want me to call them again!  LOL"
lashion denson,"My IRA account was at Sunwest Trust, which Millennium Trust acquired. Somehow when the account came over, one of the assets was improperly named. That was not Millennium's fault. However, it has taken forever to get it corrected. Then the asset spun out a second company. Again, it has taken a long time to get Millennium to respond. They drop the ball over and over and it's like the movie Groundhog Day. Its been over a year and my issue is still unresolved. I also have a friend experiencing the same issue."

KEITH TAYLOR,Always impossible to login and access your account. Access always changing and internet site doesn't always work.
GREGORY FYFFE,"They tried, but only to try to resolve the technical issue.  Not too helpful.  Pending request continues and no resolution was reached.  It would be good if they actually had someone who could look at the forms that were asked of me to be faxed / emailed and complete my transaction instead of doing tech support and troubleshoot browsers etc... which clearly is not the problem"
NEKESHA HARMON,Thank you so much for an easy transaction
RHONDA FELDER,"Because i Can't get back into my account your people are rude and will not help me.

Brent P.,"The company I worked for and had a 401K account transferred that said account to this company after I had left.  I had never heard of Millennium Trust before.  This company has been pleasant to deal with.  My only suggestion would be a different name rather than Millennium, because I can’t help but imagine it is staffed by Millennials and doesn’t suggest the company has been very long."

Belgica Cevallos,Helped when I really needed my money
S Littleton,"Through no fault of the representatives I spoke with, I would rate the company poorly. It is ridiculous that they refuse to do anything online and make you mail in transfer requests, then mail a check with no tracking or information for clients. Then if the check is lost you are charged 30 dollars or forced to wait half a year to have the chance to have your check again mailed with no tracking. It is the 21st century, what is wrong with you? Especially with all of the delays and issues with the mail due to covid. You would think the company would adjust to meet client needs, but they clearly do not care about putting consumers first."
Joan Bowling,Very friendly customer service. Stayed on the phone with me while filling out forms. Didn't rush and answered all my questions.

MATTHEW SOSEBEE,I sent a certified letter with the paperwork required to take my funds out and have not received an acknowledgement.  Neither by mail or by email of what the status of my request is.
DOUGLAS SHERIFF,"My former employer’s plan, T Rowe Price, put my 401k account into Millenium without my permission. They told me they transferred it over to Millenium because I no longer work at my former employer’s place, even though I requested them to rollover my account to my current employer’s plan. Millenium made it quite a process to rollover my 401k to my current employer’s account. The site is not user friendly and they charge hefty fees for the process. I was able to eventually rollover my account but Millenium doesn’t make it easy. I wouldn’t recommend making an account with them. It seems like most people’s accounts end up there not by choice."
M A,This was a great first time buying experience. I’m excited to continue to watch the market and start trading!
Heath Luetkens,I had a woman named BJ . I didn’t get her last name. She walked me through the whole process over the phone . Bj was a lot of help to me .
Robyn Lazzarini,"No way to send funds directly to new institution. Makes you do it yourself. Time sensitive, many do it better."
Patti Spencer,Outrageous fees. Not going to use them when they take a fee for everything including doing nothing.
Emilio Garcia ,"Capital One notified my wife a couple months that they were getting out of the IRA business, and transferring her IRA to Millenium Trust, as of a date mid June. The amount being small (a few thousand), she took a complete distribution of the IRA directly from Capital One at least a month before the transition date.Nonetheless, Millenium Trust continues to send my wife completely inaccurate emails, about how her account _will_be_ transferred to them as custodian. Plainly pure marketing; verging on misleading and, if they continue after they see they get no actual account, giving the appearance of fraudulent. Who would trust their money to an organization that communicates so carelessly and inaccurately?!Update: Well after hearing from Mellenium's representative, wife and I went back and logged into Capital one again. It turns out there was _another_ Ira account at Cap One with a few cents in it, that had been left over fro either a closing or unsuccessful rollover. That 0.22 acct had been sitting there for years. Cap One dutifully listed that tiny acct as being about to transfer to Millenium, and (w/o any human looking at the amount and wondering), Millenium started sending me computer-marketing.  So evidently no disreputability here. And their rep took action to see that I'll get no more emails."
Janet Green,The customer service rep for Millennium Trust that I talked to was very nice and helpful. I didn't need to repeat or explain over and over again for her to understand what I needed. She was very knowledgeable and emailed me the forms right away so I could get them in the mail the same day. It was a good experience.
BRADLEY POLLARD,My questions was answered in a proper manner. The representative had knowledge of their services.
Awesome,"Easy, user friendly for busy people"

Ultimately You received a message my info received but needed a marriage certificate to prove two last names . I never received confirmation that all was complete and good to go .

I dont know if this is a scam and a bbb rating isnt something that is as iron clad as it used to be, i can open a business and get one if im willing to pay for it. I have been scammed and had my identity stolen so when i got the letter it am suspicious.  Im done, none of this matters. If i get a tax penalty because i didnt receive the letter until June ill deal with it. If i ever get back on my feet im moving this to another company that knows how to calm suspicious customers and talk to people who have no clue who you are."

Old employer dumped a 401k into an account there.  I received a statement, called, had to navigate through a near impossible phone menu to talk to someone (actually had to have them call me back).

ANTWAN WHITFIELD,"Millenium Trust is not easy to work with and they *do not* want to make it easy to work with them. It makes sense, really. They don't want you to take your money out of their accounts. They want to hold on to it and generate interest off of your assets.We all have a choice in where we bank. I'm glad to be taking my business elsewhere, to an institution that actually wants to do honest business with me.byeeeeeeeeeeeee"

BRYAN SALEK,"The agent was rude, made many assumptions that I knew how the process of transferring funds worked. If I knew the answers I would not have called your customer service line. The customer service agent I spoke with needs additional training to know how to speak with people who might not be as knowledgeable about financial information as she is considering she works in the field. A training on how to explain information on differing levels of financial literacy would be ideal! It was embarrassing and frustrating speaking to the agent and I am writing this post to avoid having anyone else for feel this way."

Thank you"
CATHRYN TITCOMB,"Requested direct distribution to new retirement plan, but would not distribute to new servicer without them submitting a Millennium release form, which does not seem to exist, nor is mentioned in the instructions or by customer service. Process lasted into a new year, so another annual maintenance fee was charged, and then a fee to close the account was charged too. All I want is to put this small amount of money where I can manage it with the rest of my investments, but this holding company seems like it's more about charging fees and frustrating 'clients' than providing a service.I'll be very glad to be done with them."
STEPHANIE MOORE,"It was a great on line experience. East to use and direct. The only issue is, the amount of money to be received was never mentioned"

Trish Adams,Only thing I have issues is navigating your we website
James Doebley,Horrible customer service service. Very rude.

MY MONEY WAS MOVED FROM FIDELTY TO THIS COMPANY BY MY PREVIOUS EMPLOYER AND WHEN I CALLED TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS MY ACCOUNTS NO ONE HAS BEEN HELPFUL. I HAVE HAD TO CALL SEVERAL TIMES BECAUSE IT KEEPS SAYING MY INFO ISN'T VALID AND EACH TIME THE REPRESENTIVE I GET IS CLUELESS AND VOMITS BACK USELESS INFORMATION. I HAVE TRIED BOTH ON MY CELL PHONE AND ON MY LAPTOP TO NO AVAIL. AS SOON AS I AM ABLE TO ACCESS MY ACCOUNTS I WILL BE MOVING MY MONEY TO A COMPANY THAT CAN ACTUALLY FUNCTION CORRECTLY. I AM LIVID MY MONEY WAS MOVED WITHOUT BEING CONSULTED AND I AM WORRIED THAT THIS COMPANY HAS ANY CONTROL OF MY ASSETS.

Paul Utsler,"I was very pleased with my experience. I wasn’t able to access my account online so I contacted Client Services/Retirement Services. After verifying my account information, the representive was able to assist me in getting access to my account. She walked me through it rather than just telling me what to do and leaving me to my own devices. She did it in an efficient and professional manner. I was able to get into my account and was able to finish what I needed to do expediently. If in the future I find the need to utilize Millenium Trust, I will do so with no hesitation."

NAOMI ANDRADE,"Though I received my disbursement in a timely manner, when I tried directly rolling over my IRA to my primary retirement fund, Millennium would not act on my request as submitted from TIAA-CREF, but required me to utilize their internal request instead. This created an unnecessary delay in the process, and led to my withdrawal of the funds, risking a penalty for early withdrawal, and directly depositing them into my primary retirement account."
Sam,"Plain, direct, professional, kind, and knowledgeable information; which allowed me to make an informed decision related to just my account.  I appreciated the security check levels to ensure that I was - whom I said I was.  This is what I received when connected to Client Services with a Millennium Trust Company consultant.  Thank you."

Liz,Thank you for helping and really appreciate your patient she was really helpful 😊 ☺ thanks again 😊
GINA KIENBAUM,"My retirement account was originally held by Fidelity, but at some point it was transferred to Millennium without any notice or explanation, at which point it seems to have been converted to cash and no longer accrued any growth or interest. When I finally got around to transferring it to the final institution that houses my current employer's retirement account, I was only given the option to have the check sent directly to me, even though it's being rolled over into another financial institution, so I'll need to then mail it to the new institution myself. As a final insult, I was charged a $25 fee for this process. Acknowledging that much of my irritation is with my old employer and the policies that regulate these sorts of transfers, Millennium's role in this process seems to have cost me money with no discernible benefit."
TENILLE HUCKINS,"First time calling! A little bit of a wait but, very happy with customer service"
Freewilly,The representative was very helpful and stayed on phone to assist and then sent email to another department to trouble shoot will call back!

Elizabeth Vega,Very simple to use. Process was great.
Marc S.,Still can not  and still haven problem to cash out my money.
Belinda Amaya,I’ve had nothing but good experiences with Millennium Trust. The online portal is very user friendly and easy to navigate.
REUBEN FEDERICO,The overall experience was not pleasant. The process to initiate a direct rollover is tedious and instructions are ambiguous. A common vernacular is not established and terms like “rollover” and “transfer” are used interchangeably. The representative that I spoke with over the phone was knowledgeable and pleasant but I had to aggressively bypass the eternal automated prompt loop with spamming ‘0’. I am overall unsatisfied with the  process and will attempt to avoid in the future.
BRANDON THOMPSON,Website was confusing so I called number listed and virtual assistant was not helpful.  It took a long time for me to get an actual person to talk with - this should be an option and it's not.

I don't trust you at all. When I finally got a human on the phones, I asked if I could just get a form for distribution mailed to meet. The answer was no. I want my money. I worked for this. No help at all. Useless."
Elizabeth Brock,"Louis was stellar and understood with care, my unique financial situation. He could have defaulted to normal procedure, but instead he took time to learn about my concern, quickly sent me to the right links, and paved the way for an expeditious process with my inquiry and needs.

I am severely computer, money, and paperwork illiterate, having had my ex handle everything similar for 20 years. The thought of trying to understand and properly execute anything of this nature makes my stomach physically hurt with an anxiety. I am so relieved that this was so straight forward and easy!"

LARRY RECLUSADO,Easy to use. hopefully it works
INGRID DE LEON,The representative was wonderful to work with. Very kind and patient.
TAYLOR HANSLOVAN,"The new phone system attempts to screen out longtime customers from speaking with a live agent by passing me to a robotic service.  This is NOT appreciated by this longtime customer.  I wouldn't be calling for support if I wanted to speak with a robot.  Plus the process for opening a new Roth IRA is not intuitive and parts of the online application process are broken (requiring a call with a live person). Last, if I qualify for Premium Support (as I do), then please route my call accordingly.  The routing process is broken - as validated by speaking with your support team"
MATT,All the people who I spoke with were very interested in helping me get all my questions answered and walked through all paperwork that was kneeded.  Would highly recommend
LEONIDAS LUCIEN,My experience with Millennium Trust has been great! I'm able to maintain my account online and the website is very user-friendly!

Gary Bullock,"I inquired several times how much saving is in my retirement fund, and I still have no answer. I just don’t know where to go from here. The customer service is not people friendly.

CHESLEY GRIFFIS,"Trying to switch my account to another company.  Called spoke with a representative and they instructed us to use the link in my email, that they could not facilitate the request over the phone. Not a normal circumstance btw. Logged into my account to start the convoluted process and mysteriously your website was under construction.  Ridiculous.  No, thank you."
GRANT DUGAN,"A former part time employer transferred a small sum of money that I was unaware of to Millennium Trust. I was contacted immediately by mail with a packet explaining who they were and how my money ended up in an account with them, the details of how those funds came into their possession and the options I now have. This was a small amount of money so I elected to close the account. I started that process myself online and within a few days the funds were deposited into one of my personal bank accounts. The whole process from receiving the letter to receiving the funds took about one week and I was able to easily navigate the website and upload documents to  I prove my identity so pretty much everything was done online easily by me. Thanks millennium trust!"
PATRICIA ESPINAL,It was great to find out y’all had the funds
MARLYN CHRISTIAN,Customer service is very nice and helpful and very knowledgeable had answers to all my questions thank you very much
VAN,"If you are trying to move money from this account into another account where you might have another IRA or 401K held, it will be nearly impossible. They make it impossible for you to do.Update. I received a call from Gwen. She left a message and number to call her back. I called the number. It was an automated system that does not allow anyone to ask a question like, ""May I speak to Gwen"", or even, ""I'd like to talk to a person"". So still no luck. They say they tried but they didn't. Still can't get ahold of anyone."
MARK SMITH,"I called several times about the same issue and each time I called, the rep was very professional and helpful."
Customer Jackie Brown,"Oh my goodness - Alicia from Pittsburgh was wonderful!! We needed help with a rollover and her kind, patient manner of walking us through the process was simply the best.  She made, what was to us a very difficult process, seem as simple and easy as pie.  She spoke very clearly and concisely, guiding us with care and answering our numerous questions with a sweetness that was above and beyond what we were expecting.  Because we are both in our 60's we are accustomed to the frustrations due to our lack of knowledge in this age of advanced technology.  Alicia provided patient guidance that will be long remembered and appreciated by us.  5 stars simply aren't enough - Thank You So Much Alicia!!  You are an angel sent by God to help us during our time of need!  Thank you and God bless you!!   ~William & Cheryl Hayes"

DARREN CARDOZA,"This is the third time I've tried to transfer my funds out of Millenium Trust to my other existing IRA. These last 2 transfer requests have gone through my financial advisor via fax, following your online guidelines and confirmation faxes have been received. There has been no communication through your end and funds have not been received. When I contact your office, I've been told there is no information on file. Last week I completed the online process to have my funds transferred to my checking account. I have not received any confirmation that this will be processed, nor have I received the funds. I have spent numerous hours online and on the phone trying to complete this process. I am very dissatisfied with the customer service I have received from Millenium Trust."

Dwight Smith,All I want to do is to take a distribution and your system is not letting me do it. The company we had before I could do it online with no problems. Why isn't it easy to get my money. I even called customer service and all they could do for me was to send me distribution forms.Why is it so difficult?  Help.

I must wait 20 business days before receiving my roll-over retirement money by check; and 2.) I must complete a second part of this transaction when I receive your ""welcome email!"" In my opinion, this is totally wrong--especially since the amount I'm requesting is less than 2K."

MICCAH LOEUM,"No follow through. Having to call each month because no confirmation emails are sent. Keep asking to confirm email and information-almost shady- Because I have to repeat each time like they don’t have any information on me. Keep searching all forms.

THOMAS MASON,"The CSR was so awesome, she made the process quick and easy!"
JERRY,"The website is not intuitive. There’s no indication that Chrome is the optimal browser.

AMY FISHER,After almost 3 months of trying to gain control of my funds it was a pleasure that knew what they were doing! Dorothy from Utah was spot on and solved my problem in a matter of 5 minutes once I was taken off hold. Hold time was listed at 4 minutes but lasted about an hour. But once I was put in touch with Dorothy she did her job perfectly.
Maria Alarcon,The reason why I no longer follow is because I am no longer with the company that offered me the Millenium service. Thank you for your help.
ANDREA HOWARD,So very patient and eagerly answering my questions   Thanks you so much
ALEX SCRIVNER,"Terrible. Had old 401i money here. Called to get a number and instructions to transfer to Fidelity. Told it couldn't be done be online. Called Fidelity but they said I needed a millennium statement. Haven't gotten a statement in years, so tried to login. 20 minutes later couldn't get past screen asking for my beneficiary. Called customer SVC. Ttey told me that I was mistaken,that I could log in. I asked how. Long pause...""well, you can't,"" I hung up. Complete waste of time."
FLOYD MORRIS,"The Millennium Trust customer service Gwyn is so phenomenal in helping and knowledgeable. I could not access my blocked acct. She Sent email to technical support.

APRIL TRUJILLO,"Service was quick, easy, and efficient! Will definitely use services again."
CHERYLETTE LYONS,"We seemed to have different personalities. When I made statements or asked questions it seemed to be off putting to the agent, or that I wasn't listening.I work online all day and visiting online sites is not foreign. It was almost felt like an assumption-set based on age. I caution to honor your clients by not assuming they are going to respond a certain way or worst an age category denotes their understanding. I know plenty of twenty year-olds that are lost in online environments. LOL  Best to all."
VANCEEN LANGKAMER,Process was easy & my representative was very helpful. Awesome customer service
Justin ,"I had to transfer an old 401K to my current employer.  CareOne to TIAA HUMC 401K plan.  Minus the $25 fee to process the roll-over (which is a CON, but all businesses need to make money), all seems pretty good.  Just waiting now for the check to be mailed to me, to then transfer over to TIAA HUMC 401K."
Jennifer Brown,"Everything was clear, concise, and accessible. Good explanations and step by step instructions allowed me to know what exactly I was looking at. As someone young and new to finance, it was refreshing to feel helped and not tricked!"

When I wanted to be refunded that missing money unknown charges, I was directed to a ""higher up"" unable to talk to anyone.  No one answered, the person I talked to never spoke again from before being ""transferred"" and I still did not get my money.  This makes me angry.  I attempted to call to get more information.

Mir,"I want to acknowledge Ryan from Pittsburgh specifically, he gave me an immediate resolution and remained on the phone while I completed it. I have to say that up to this point my experience was pretty poor. I was previously given a link to follow which didn't work, and I was repeatedly diverted and hung up upon on the customer service line. Ryan should be commended though."
KRYSTAL GLOVER,"Millennium was outstanding. I have tried to track 2 401K's that belonged to me for some time. Terri and Michelle were helpful in finding answers for me. I had delt with 2 companies; one that because of embezzling by the CEO it was dissolved, the other was a work from home company that was useless in allowing employees information on their accounts. I now have resolution to all this thanks to Millennium. Not the best answer I needed for one account, but this frustrating situation is now finalized. Again thank you to Millennium and the great ladies that I worked with!"

STACEY MCLEAN,Great Experience
DAVID FLATT,"Pretty easy to navigate everything in a short amount of time. I do wish I can talk to a live agent, every time I called (4 times in a row) It would let me get so far and it would hang up on me in the same spot as before, all 4 times, Not good at all and it's rude and unprofessional, besides that everything else was smooth. and very user-friendly."
ANTHONY TORRES,"After making multiple calls, I FINALLY got through to someone that seemed to be able to help. She sent me a form to complete and return to get my money. Today, I received a voicemail from her saying ""they"" needed to speak with me again. The number she provided is a recording that continuously hangs up after I attempt to use their prompts. REALLY bad customer service."

Randall Crick,I've become disabled and need it for bills
Eileen Thiesing Riordan,"Schwab chose this fiduciary when they no longer wanted to hold private equities. Millennium over charges, impossible to talk to a human being, no correspondence and no explanation on upcoming charges (they just show up on your cc)...terrible organization and I am leaving! Google for another fiduciary. I found one!"
DENISE TRAN,"I had put off making a change to my account, then when I decided to make the change I needed help. The person that helped me was very patient and very kind. She got me where I needed to be and then stayed on for the duration until I was completed making the necessary change.  I appreciate the help I received and look forward to working with Millennium Trust again.  Thank you to the person that helped me.  Sheri B"
ZACHARY DETRANO,1. Every login which happens every 2-3 months is a nightmare.2. Black ink on white background provides the best contrast. Light green print on a green background is the dumbest thing to do.

KRISTINE HARRIS,"I was told I had the trust account one year after I no longer worked for the company that provided it.  I was told it had 387 dollars.  I planned on keeping and adding to it monthly however they are hard to reach.  About a year later I tried to just cancel and get my money but their website is very hard to use and navigate.  I gave up but noticed my balance dropped to 187. By the time the fees and taxes came off once I finally found how to transfer and close I only recieved 140 but my transaction history does not show any penalties, fees or withdrawal.  Will never use millennium trust."

Tyree Stokes,"I wanted to roll over my Roth IRA and you ask for something that is unheard of - completely - to put more hurdles and to try keep my money by any means - a signature of acceptance of funds from where they will go???? Of course they will accept!P.S. Called me to argue with my unfavorable opinion, that I have as a consumer. Unprofessional. Also, no personalization and knowledge of your customers - I do not identify myself with a person who's photo you put on the letter welcoming me to your trust that was not my choice.P.S.2 Company keeps spamming me with responses, it must have the last word. Suck it up!!"
DENISE JOYNER,Peggy went above and beyond to assist me in getting into my account since I was on a time crunch. She was very friendly and determined to help me meet my deadline. Very grateful!

Mathew Lawrence,Major problems trying to register on line
JOHN BEVAN,Millennium Trust representatives are very friendly and helpful. They guided me through my transaction and explained available options. Many prions are available for retirement. The website and setting up personal profile is simple and easy to maneuver.

JENAE TOWNSEND,waited 30 min on the phone left my # for a call backnever happen!!
JORGE MARTINEZ RAMIREZ,So far so good.
Jenn,"When phoning the company, they referred me to use online tools instead of dealing with the issue immediately despite validation of person. When using online tools the portal is very secure. Then some dumb piece at your company emails the account numbers. EMAIL! What a wildly insecure way to provide information, when the person on the phone is concerned about validation of person... To then turn around and email a full account number is absurd. Y'all gonna get sued over security one of these days! Glad I'm moving my money out of your organization."
Veronica Torres,It was very easy to transfer my IRA.good customer service.
C. COOPER,Just horrible my account got transferred to you guys from Fidelity the way the whole thing was handled once the account was in you guys hand was very unacceptable not having access to the funds 20 to 30 have to set up everything myself online to be able to gain access to the account if I was older and computer illiterate this task would be very very difficult and most older people once they reach retirement age they have a hard time and this is how y’all would make it for them absolutely horrible would not recommend y’all
CONNOR BLACKWELL,"I don’t want to be unfair but as a young man that works hard to have some sorta retirement and a company like this comes along and take out 120 dollars in fees just because you didn’t realize your old company was gonna move your money is very sad, predatory and evil. Just like traditional banks you people steal from lower class workers to line your pockets. I can’t see how people like you sleep at night. Whoever came up with this idea I pray God change your heart and teach you to love your fellow humans.Pros: I was able to transfer the money to my bank without paperwork.Cons: To do regular rollover you have to fill out the long paperwork (yes actually paper like in the old days) and MAIL it. Just so you can transfer money to another IRA or 401k. They also charge you a huge fee just to move your money through their account which is technically what happened since I didn’t even have the money in there for long. Also they told me all they would charge was the 35 dollars but no they charge me 35 dollars for EACH account that was open with them PLUS 25 dollars to close each accounts when I was moving my money."
AFZAL MOHAMMED,The process to cash out a small amount was quick and relatively easy and I received the money very quickly. I have no complaints
LANA COMSTOCK,It was very easy to receive my money I had this in my bank within 72 hours and no hassles very smooth process!
RICHARD GAMWELL,The website is nothing but a hassle to get onto. I had to get help a couple of times just to get logged in then when I just wanted a partial withdrawal I couldn't even understand how to do it so I ended up taking all my money because I don't want this hassle just to get out my money when I do need it. I didn't even know my money was with you guys otherwise I probably would've switched it to my company that I'm with now so I'm very disappointed that I was never notified of any of this
ANGELA GAMBRELL,slow with distribution. need to work on distributing customer money faster. time is still good. the customer service is great. and agents are easy to talk to and very understanding to situation. ECELLENT keep it up team.
OSCAR MEDINA,"The problem never got fixed. All I want to do is change my phone number for heavens sake! I'm sure you'll keep charging me your high fees to maintain an account that I can't even get serviced.  I'll waste some more time next week and call into customer service.  Hopefully after the 2nd or 3rd time,  I can't get service."
JASON FLANARY,Transactions process faster than originally communicated.  Thank you!
SABRINA COLEMAN,Very happy  with your customer service

SEAN WALDRON,"I cant transfer my funds after months of waiting. I have submitted the proper paper work, responded to emails and called agents."
THOMAS WEST,"Room for ImprovementSome documents were eDoc, others required print and sign (did not need wet signature), additional documents were required due to missing information left off initial (and instead of admitting the mistake, it was passed off as it wasn't signed...yet it was missing - own up to your mistakes). Then to setup the account they sent one link that was not clear and required an account number. I tried two numbers, neither worked. When I reached out, I told I didn't need the account number and provided a different link. Overall, not so impressed."

Jerry Glover,Both accounts were not listed when I went to view them. Only Roth  & not the IRA showed up. The total of these were over 5k and should not have been transferred to Millenium to only be hit with multiple fees that were excessive!Now I am being told there is a ridiculous fee to close out the account and transfer the funds to LPL where they should have gone like they did before.Kem

I was earning .36 cents on my account and charged $35.00 each year for processing. including other fees I withdrew the remainder of the funds out because my investment company was taking more than I was earning. I left with less than $375. if I would not have called to withdraw they would have taken it all. I should have recieved a alert or a notification I was losing money. instead millennium just kept taking and would have until it was all gone Gerard Chavez714 539-9488
Cheryl,Out were supposed to send an email with a link to how I can get in to see my account with you but did not so I will have to call you again
CASSANDRA CORTEZ,"My 401k was transferred to this account after I left Lapage Bakery. I went in to close out the account, followed the steps and had my money the same day in my checking account. Simple to request, fill out the information and collect. Great job!"
Tim Rivet,Jackie R. Was amazing helping me and showed so much patience while working with me.
DAVID ARNZEN,"Puts Onus on other institutions. IRA account transfers/rollovers typically are dispensed by the holding institution (here, Millennium Trust) to the receiving institution (insert your bank of choice). However Millennium Trust requires your personal bank to contact them in order to do this, and my bank has told me they are the only institution that does this and has a form specifically because of them. Charges money for transfer and closing out the account when I never consented to them being the account holder in the first place."
UNIQUA Q.,The representative was very friendly. She was able to answer my questions and provide a resolution immediately. I feel very comfortable with my ability to manage my account moving forward.
Renee Scott,"Edited: Raised from one star to four. I called back in after being hung up on and got a hold of Tasha, from the Chicago Office. She was very helpful and said she would personally expedite the payout. She kindly explained what needed to be done. If you get Tim, from the Pittsburgh office in support, hang up and try again. He was rude, not helpful and hung up on me. I originally called into Millennium Trust Company on the 22nd of April to initiate a disbursement. I was told it would take between 10 and 15 days. I just called in on the 2nd of May to make sure everything was lining up for an on time payment and was told by Tim that although I submitted my printed deposit slip with the correct information it wasn't signed and so I need to send in a new one and start the wait time over which now is running at around 20 days to process. I asked for a supervisor and he hung up on me and didn't attempt to call me back."
BLAIR DAVIS,From beginning to end withdrawing my money was fast and easy
BLESSING ANDERSON,I was talking to mercy and she was super nice and very knowledgeable about her job! Thank you

CHELSEA PHEGLEY,website not clear on topics needing response.
TONNIE BEEVERS,First of all let me say this. I was never told by my former employer that the money I had in that 401k account t of thiers would be moved. Second of all what the heck were u people doing taking money out of that account? I was never warned properly of that action.Only when I went to move the money did I see I had lost 100.00 dollars of it.So really in all actuality you  people are just another parasite preying on the unsuspecting public.
Greg Englar,"Quick and easy, getting cash together to buy house would use again in future."
Martin T,Withdrawal instructions were clear. Process was easy and quick.
Evan Woodburn,My 401 k was transferred to millennium trust. I cashed out only because my current employment doesn’t have a retirement program as of yet. As soon as I enroll in a retirement program I plan on transferring my funds back to millennium trust as I trust this company will protect my future.
YESSENIA SANCHEZ,My experience with your company was excellent.  The processes were quick and efficient.
MARK SCHNEIDER,Guy I talk to on the phone was very helpful and answered all my questions with ease!
Rhonda Morgan,"Have to jump through hoops many times to prove my identity over and over again just to get Millennium Trust to send a check (FBO me) to my ROTH IRA at another financial institution. I get that there are protections in place to prevent fraud, but I didn't authorize Millennium Trust to accept my funds from a former employer in the first place. Perhaps Millennium Trust should practice the same diligence prior to receiving FBO funds without obtaining release from the owner before opening accounts. Not to mention the fees charged without notifying me and obtaining an approval. And can I speak with a human being?!! I'd rather not communicate with an automated system every single time and option after option."
CLAYTON MOLDEN,Alot of hidden fees that I was unaware of. They charge for every transaction where a person would not be able to make any money.

Kristin ,Great customer service. Could not be more thankful for the help received!
SHERIE ROBERTS,"Extremely helpful in helping me locate my account, and providing instructions and walking me through setting up my online account, as well as providing what info is needed for an IRA transfer to another company.

NM,Takes a long time to transfer IRA account having only cash to my other broker dealer IRA account. So the processing time is not good.
JEFFREY POPE,it was easy to direct deposit my money in my account
JEFFERSON BALTZEGAR,"I like the fact of getting to a rep was quick and their patience.   The confirmation to access my account was complicated and no one was able to get it yo work.  Other than that, I was pleased with their services."

Julien kamga,"The transaction was quick and easy. It wasn’t clear on the portal when I would expect my withdrawal, but I received the confirmation page with my code and the money arrive in my account in a week! The only thing I would add, would be a note about when to expect a withdrawal to be deposited after it is requested. Thanks!"

PATSY JACKSON,Everything went very well just waiting back to see when can I get my money
CARLOS FLORES,My retirement account was assigned to these crooks without my knowledge by JPMorgan who charged a fee. I closed my account after I found out who had stolen my money and THEY charged a fee. I'm sure it was done 'legally' but behind my back. So tired of crooks.
Dale,Everything was written clearly. I just followed the directions and I received my money the very next day.
CHRISTOPHE WARREN,No incentive to leave your IRA there. They charge too much in fees
CHRISTOPHER WOOSLEY,I mean my previous employer rolled my IRA over to this company and since I am now disabled I decided to just cash out as I am having personal financial problems. They made that process so extremely easy so far anyways! Hopefully in 1-2 days as they stated I will have my money and get a little financial relief in my life.
AMANDA BOWMAN,"My Employer send my 403b to Mellinim , without my knowledge or Consent , now I’m trying to roll this to my personal IRA Merrell Edge Bank of America , and all I get when I call or go on line is the runaround, automated instructions and complicated forms needed that you don’t provide , even when my bank representative was able to get a hold of a person , they sound like the automated robot keep repeating the same complicated and vague instructions on the website ! It’s no wonder when reading the blogs online and internet reviews you get poor ratings !! Customer service ? Practicality ? Client satisfaction? This Company need a Major overhaul in these basic business practices! I don’t know how they’ve survived this far ! Or maybe not !"
DIANA SCHLENDER,My experience has been that the portal is difficult to get into not mention persons whom are not familiar with computers. Yall charge for everything. My money was sent to you from a prior company .

MICHAEL JENSEN,Help was great and problem was handled very quickly and well.
KEVIN ROYSTER,"I received a letter in the mail advising I was now being moved to Millennium Trust Company as a customer. I was a little apprehensive because I had never heard of this company. Now, I would recommend them to anyone that has a knack for saving and investing. The website was easy to use as well!!"
Barry Stone,"Nina. Thank You so much. You helped me out beyond expectations. I really appreciated your knowledge, expertise, professionalism and understanding in helping me accomplish the task of getting things in order to rollover my funds to Fidelity.

GARY DIMINICO,"I recieved the check I requested,  shorted by $35 that two different associated said would not happen. One associate said be assured I wouldn't be shorted.

DAVID ELLNER,Good very good
TERRIBLE,"I had no control over my IRA being sent to Millennium so 2 days after it was transferred to them I chose to close my account. There was not only a $25 fee (for having my money for less than a week) but very few options on disbursement; a debit card or a bank transfer (and then only if the account is in your name, my account is in husbands name). So I had no choice but to take the debit card which can only be sent by US mail. I would NOT do business with them in the future."
AUTHOR STEPHENS,"For the short time I had my savings with Millennium, I felt like it was in the right hands. They make everything super clear when it comes to fees/penalties and it feels like they really cared about my money. If I didn't have to withdraw my account, I would have kept it there. Will definitely be considering Millennium for my future needs. Thank you."
Audrey Sims,Having a problem getting through the second batch of questions I need help but they keep redirecting me to the internet
TINA KELLY,"Excessive fees pretty much ate any small amount I had left from an old employer, then the market took the rest. They should Make a better effort to reach out to ppl about there accounts just sitting there getting eaten away by fees"

Carl Parks,"I don't necessarily agree with all your procedures and I think the whole 401K deal is a bit of a ripoff for those who don't know what they're doing and don't know to call. But that's just my personal opinion. As they say, let the buyer beware."
IYORE IYAMU,Completing everything online was smooth and easy.
DARREL ANTHONY,"Agent was patient, calm, knowledgable and very helpful."
PATRICK GIGLIOTTI,"I previously called my retirement account’s original holder and had to ask several questions repeatedly until I was told my account was given to Millennium Trust, it was an exhausting experience. I was bracing myself for the same experience with Millennium Trust but the customer service was clear, precise, helpful. I am grateful for their assistance and for the efficiency of their website and client portal!"
LOU ANNARUMMA,"It's impossible to get to talk to anyone. You make rollovers very difficult.This is 21st century, what do you need paper forms for?Wake up."

BRENDAN OGARA,"My former employer transferred my 401k to you after I left that job. Instead of continuing to invest you sat on the money for a year. Then when I decided to pull the money your website was very difficult to use. Creating an account was not easy. The user account portal is nonexistent. There were no options for me to do anything. When I tried to roll my 401k from you into my personal bank investment account I got an email that you couldn't do that but I could move it into my checking. That option was never given up until that point. Why are my options not clearly stated upon me logging into your crappy webstie? Then, on top of it all, you're stealing $25 from me when you did absolutely nothing with my money in the first place to earn it. You are terrible and believe me I will tell everyone I know how awful and horrible my experience was with you."
RAYMOND TERRY,The woman I talked with was short and condescending. She also told me she would change my address in the system which she did not do.

KAREN,Process was fluid and timely.
BRET NORDIN,"There are reviews that are pretty negative about this company along the lines of hassle, website not working, and more. Personally I did not experience any of those situations. The withdrawal process was pretty straightforward and the payments were minimal, like a 25 dollar fee. I chose not to hold off 10% just in case I didn't have to. Hope others won't panic once they see my review.Edited spelling and grammar"
FRANCISCO CRUZ,I cashed out my 401 and still waiting on my check
DYLAN BECK,Was promp in payment. Thats refreshing. Usually any place that's hole thing is money. Banks retirement  stocks.etc. are fast to take slow to release.

ANNA ORTIZ,"An account was created for me on behalf of my previous employer - because I've already got an account setup with my current employer, I figured I'd withdraw the funds deposited into my account with Millenium Trust. MT was very straightforward and easy to use and it made the withdrawal process easy! I will be keeping them in mind when I'm considering opening a new account."
Phuong Nghi Nguyen,THE PERSON MY SON & I SPOKE TO WAS VERY COURTEOUS TO US. SHE HELPED & GAVE US ALL THE INFORMATION WE NEEDED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

BROOKE,"1) Money was transferred to there institution without my knowledge.2) No interest or dividend returns were evident by a 1099 but fees were imposed3) Following there guidelines to transfer my money out of their institution was met with additional requirements.4) Due to the difficulty I am having, I am working with a broker with a well established firm to get my money out of there institution.5) according to there fee structure on 4/21/22, it will cost me additional fees to get my money out of their institution"

Lisa Billing,Simply the best - would like to see how the value of the investment has changed over time

After trying countless if times to no avail, she forwarded the correct document for me to fill out while she waited on telephone. I had filled out so many but the system just wouldn't do it and wouldn't even acknowledge my number. It was a nightmare, so I was so thankful to finally have someone so dedicated and helpful. I apologize I don't know how to write her name but she was awesome. Now one more hurdle to see if it actually comes through."
FARHEEN JAHANGIR,"Calling customer service is a joke. They tell you you must do everything online. It took over 2 hours to confirm my account.  It kept saying I wasn't an American citizen!  Finally, I got it straight only to find out I could not see my statement which was my reason for going online because customer service can't send it to you. They can only confirm the balance.Since my last review Millennium reached out to me and emailed me a copy of my statement.  I appreciate their concern with my frustration and putting things straight."

BAHNAM DANIAL,My 401K from a previous employer was transferred to Millennium Trust.  Through the onboarding process I needed to speak to a customer service representative twice.  Millennium Trust has some of the best phone support I have encountered.  Their support is enabled to view the account and talk through the issue that I was experiencing with the website.
Adam Clair,Called in for assistance and the experience was very positive.  The representative was very helpful and informative and stayed with me to follow through as I performed what I needed to do online.  Thank you so much.

WILLIAM MELENDEZ,"I had to wait for what seemed like forever on hold before getting connected with a representative.  We waited nearly an hour!

However, the representative who eventually helped us was excellent, knowledgeable, efficient, helpful and polite."

YUSMIN DELGADO,"We called one of the phone numbers listed on the RMD Form but had to wait almost 1 hour for someone to come on the line. Then we were told we had the wrong number and were transferred to the correct number which took only a few minutes. The staff at both numbers were awesome, kind, helpful.  The major problem was that none of the phone numbers listed on the form itself took us to the correct department.  Once there, all was great."
JOSHUA SATER,"Tried to have wire transfer put into account from Wells Fargo at Wells Fargo branch. Have receipt of transaction. Transactions show that wire transfer went through and was returned. Called to try to resolve the issue so that I could put the money into my millennium trust account. Nothing was resolved, no one reached back out as promised. Still at a loss for what to do."
ANNETTE D,"The Representitive that helped me resolve an issue was very courteous and helpful. despite the issue being caused on the other firm’s side, she went out of her way to make sure the issue was resolved by setting up a 3-way conference call. It was the best customer services I have received at a call center in a decade or more. Thank you."
FARHAD ABAZARI,The assistant I received was fabulous.
MICHAEL REX,Thank you for your help I really appreciate you
CYNTHIA MERCER,"I found out today Millennial Trust has had my 401k for 6 years. I was never notified nor agreed to change 401k provider, nor agreed to their fees. They have charged between 45 and 65 US dollars per year to maintain an account that has accrued between 75c and $1.64 a year in interest. Every time I call about this issue we get ""disconnected"". Completely predatory practices"
CYNTHIA BELL,No one has answered any of my questions yet.
MARY ROBINSON,Phone etiquette

STEVEN ARREOLA,"Requested a withdrawal and it was no issue at all , very easy process !"
CHRISTINA DETTMAN,"I did not chose Millenium Trust, my prior employer 401(k) migrated assets here, so I was stuck with them.  First, it took over 2 weeks from the time my account was migrated to the time I was finally able to access my account, including 5 separate calls to Millennium.  Next, their login in process to setup your new account requries 7 different click throughs to acknowlege items on their website. What shoud be a 1 minute process takes over 5 because of all of the ""Accepting of Terms"" required to setup your account.Then their list of fees they charge is absurd.  $10 for a paper statement, annual holding fees, transaction fees, processing fees.  It is absolutely ridiculous.The first chance I get, I will be moving my funds from them and not do business with them."
LAUREN DEL TORO,The site was easy to use and the representative I spoke to on the phone was very polite and answered all my questions.
JAYFORD BROWN,"It wasn’t too difficult to get my money, I only had to answer a few questions"

Very helpful and polite when I spoke with them and they made the whole process smooth and simple. Even the forms on there website had easy to follow informative notations to make each question simple to understand. Was given follow up emails and letters after I sent in any forms. There punctuality with processing my documents was very impressive as well. I highly recommend this company as investment holder.
NICOLE LAMANCUSA,Qqqqwwqqqqqqqq

JCI,There’s no reason that in the year 2022 3rd party firms are still getting away with charges/fees when investing is literally free now. Also I’ve been trying to just rollover my employment plan to my new employers plan and they literally make you just wanna liquidate the account because of frustration. The website is not user friendly and in order to get the document needed to rollover you have to hope that you can speak with a rep so they can email it to you!!!Make the process easier!!!

AC,I had a small issue. Issue was solved rapidly. Can't beat that with a big stick.

Joseph Blakeley,No issues. Retired so putting funds to other use
VERANDA HAYWOOD,"Too expensive!When my company put those funds into Millennium Trust it was about $1000.00. AFAIK, retirement accounts are supposed to grow, not shrink; but after 4 years, the balance of my account is down to $746!!! Ridiculousness! I left it in there so long because it's just a hassle trying to move retirement funds, but I've lost money keeping this account open. It is now closed."
RODNEY DAVIS,The representative was very nice and patient with me. She showed me where I was getting stuck on computer issues and how to get going on applying for my distribution
PENNY GRIEME,I just want access to my money have jumped thrpugh hoops for 2 weeks. Everytime i call there is something new i need to do to drawy money out and close account.

RAHMA AHMED,Easy to navigate the site and easy to process transactions
BRIGETTE BARNES,Your online processes are efficient and easy to use!!
Rick Doyle,I had a rollover from a previous employer into a Millennium Trust IRA (by default).   Of course I waited until tax time to deal with it as an avid procrastinator.  I had a few questions and was very pleased with  help from Alicia (sp?) to clarify a few things.  Very pleasant to work with - and got everything I needed.   Thank You!
ALEX ELLISON,Why does it take 20 business days to look at a account? I put into my 402 every 2 weeks and you very happy tool my money. When I want to cash it out oh no 20 business days which equal to a month. Why is what I want to know. I believe your like the dann government you take my money but when I want it back you are so damn greedy you don't want to let go of said money. This is why I don't put my money in one. You people are down right disgusting and make me sick.

BRIAN,Fast response and resolved my issue right away
JOHN CORLISS,The representative was very helpful
MARIA VELAZQUEZ,Way too much automation.  Still don't have a screen to do a withdrawal and the instructions didn't match what was available on the screen.
JENNIFER WELCH,I have tried to put mi IRA and ROTH account together for about 6 months. Still waiting on your response.
Louis luc Jean Baptiste,Agent was great but the process to recover funds is terrible. Not many places have checks and you have more than enough information to process a distribution over the phone like fidelity and other banks. I will never leave my money with your financial institution in the future. I’m trying to secure funds quickly for a house and you have delayed my process. Very very dissatisfied.Not sure if right hand talks to the left. I received a call saying I needed to submit an additional signature page and was sent 2 emails. I called back and they confirmed I needed to resubmit the same documents since they don't take electronic signatures like docusign(another failing) and a signature page. I submitted the documents immediately yet they called back 2 hours later saying they read my review and asking if I resubmitted my documents. I guess they didn't check before calling. I wish I could give a zero for this process. Looking forward to staying only with Fidelity in the future.
D. AUSTIN,Very pleased with customer care!!
Sandy Srelz,Great service!
LANCE BLACKDEER,Couldn't have been more easy to transfer my 401k
MARK,Very quick and easy. I liked it :)
STEVEN BURCELL,quick and easy to work with them and their website.

"Alicia-Pensacola,FL",I have tried to work with this company for over a year now--the CS was not helpful and hold time too long for working people.
J TURNER,You're website is really crappy and extremely hard to navigate. Your system is also very unresponsive. I have an extremely low view of your company and it has been a nightmare working with you.
WILLIAM HAYES,MT exists for a single purpose. Getting every fine they can out of any money you put in. Zero dollar returns and fees out the wazoo. Would have given 0 stars if i could have
KIMBERLY,I called there's support. She was very helpful.
JOAN CROSSETT,Very easy to work with and very friendly staff !
MONICA STEELE,my money transferred to you by employer ..lots of high cost fees. finally got my money out of your greedy hands....lol.. never again.really hard to get access to my account to transfer my money away from your company.
MILENIA PEREZ,So far one of the worst companies I have ever dealt with. My account was rolled over to them two weeks ago. I did not receive notification. I have not received an account number. The process to roll it back to Fidelity is cumbersome and time consuming. Very stressful experience.
Satisfied Customer,I have been on hold for over an hour!  I want to transfer my IRA account because Millennium Trust charges $35 per year to manage my IRA and a $25 penalty if I wish to transfer to a different management company. AWFUL!
Marlo ,Very kind and helpful. Got my account access problem solved.
"ARIANA,M ALVAREZ MESA","I spend 30 minutes in line waiting to talk to a customer service rep just to find out that I am still missing some paperwork, no one told me about and never received communication that it was needed. Then the rep told me I would have to wait whatever time I have to wait!!!"
Alexander S Rutenbeck,"Good service, thank you."
Luis Ferreira,"Customer service is very friendly, knowledgeable and easy to communicate with."
MARK WOERNER,Very easy to use their website and very trustworthy!
SHANNON,Their accuracy and efficiency are very impressive.
THOMASINA CHURCH,"Every encounter I have had with your company has been difficult, and it usually takes me at least 4 different visits and hours of my time to accomplish the most basic tasks.  The only reason I do business with you is because unfortunately you are the agent for my bank stock."
NICHOLAS SMITH,"Millennium Trust is a good and trustworthy company. I believe it is going through growth pain as its business is rapidly expanding, and as such logistics can naturally be improved. This is not unique to MT, and let us remember that these are special times for everyone. As a new customer  in January 2022, and not being particularly computer savvy, I was having trouble accessing my IRA account online. I called the customer service desk and, after an hold of about 15 minutes or so I was able to speak with a very professional and polite representative who guided my through the process. She answered all my questions and taught me how to print a summary of my account. I was very satisfied with the interaction.Lately I am having a bit of a communication issue with MT with regards to a rollover of funds. I believe it is just a logistic glitch and I am confident that once MT and I  will work together to resolve the issue."
customer,"Everything went great, thanks"
Ashley Colter,"I was struggling to get access to my old 401k after leaving a previous company and not having access to my work email anymore. The company that was managing it wouldn’t respond or follow through with what they said they were going to send me. Then my former workplace switched companies and Millennium Trust took over. I was immediately able to access my 401k and was given the option to merge, withdrawal, or continue my account. I chose to withdrawal and received my money the same day (even though it was a Saturday and it said 1-2 business days). I’m stunned and very happy! Thank you!!!"
SCOTT LEGGIERE,"Working with millennium trust was easy, helpful and straightforward. The website was easy to use and understand. Very valuable information and again, super clear direction and ability to navigate."
TAYLOR CHAPMAN,The transaction I had with Millenium Trust was  very easy and quick. Thank you
ISREAL CHAMBERS,Thank you Great help
RACHELA LEVINSON,Got the help I needed
RONALD HAMILTON,It seems like I paid an awful lot of fees for things that didn't seem like that much work for you.  Otherwise the accounting and work was accurate and when I closed the account it was very easy and fast. I am not very computer savvy but I was able to navigate the online account dissolution with no problem.  I thought it was very cool that you used the automobiles I have owned to help verify my identity.
ALERIC SOULE,Awesome job thanks
RICHARD ROSARIO,Requested a payout using CC media. I was told  this would take 30days..that's unexceptable. There is noway this transaction should take 30 days..
DEAN HENDZEL,"I was in dire need to cash in my little 401K plan, Millennium Trust made it so easy for me.Thanks"
DON WOODS,I'm very satisfied with the service I have recieved.
TONY WILLIAMS,Good work no hassle.
BRENDA MENDOZA,"I got a postcard in the mail to go on the website and set up a profile.  It gave me the wrong address, and I couldn't do what was requested.  I called, and after the inevitable interminable phone tree, got a person, who asked me my name and address, and I was promptly cut off.  I called again, went through the same rigamarole, and when I got a person, I cut her off, and gave her my phone number so she could call me back if we got cut off.  She told me the URL was wrong, and sent me the correct one.  After that, I was able to set up my profile.  This is not aimed only at you.  EVERY company I have to deal with has customer service that stinks right out loud."
CARLOS WONG,Taxes can suck it.
ASHLEY LYNN,Don't know what the average wait time is for getting to speak with a representative.  We did online chat and the representative was very helpful.  All the information that I needed was provided.Thank You!
SUSAN ELLISON,"Easy, convenient, and fast. very fast."
Antoineeta Barker,I was able to switch over savings into stocks with the help of the gentleman on the phone the same day I called in.  Followed up with a lady and was good to go from there.  Keep up the great customer service.
LISA,Early distribution. Very easy to work with. Money was in my account much quicker than I anticipated. Process was quick and all was completed online.
WESLEY SHEPPARD,"I have called in three times in regard to gaining acess to my roth ira account. Somehow after 3 promises of gaing acess i still do not have acess to my account. This is the worst trust company i have ever had to deal with. I have spent hours on gaining access, following directions, yet somehow my ""form"" or ""Wlcome email"" has never came. Give me my money this is insane"
ALLISON EDDY,Nicole was so helpful and walked me through the entire process
JOSEPH RHODY,They were professional and it was easy to navigate.

BOBBY YOUNG,My overall experience was great. It was easy to navigate through each step.
SHAWN RINDE,Everyone was pleasant and very helpful. Except for 1woman        I could hear the exasperation in her voice
James Brock,"The website is somewhat user friendly but having to click next after each question on the forms is overkill. There’s no app that I could find. I was charged for both a transfer into millennium Trust, there a yearly fee, and another fee to transfer out. None of which I was charged for by my previous company. Because of the market right now, and your fees, I lost just under $300 in the last month on a small $2500 account balance and transferring to millennium wasn’t my choice in the first place. I’m putting my money somewhere else. Thanks."
Henry Alicea Cruz,Easy and simple.
ELIZABETH BALDERA,The Representative was very patient and helped me through the set-up process.
MARK FISCHER,"Very friendly, correct responses, and on time payment"

Helene VanCleave,Thank you for the assistance with the account information.

TONI,My questions were answered quickly and with expertise.
ANGIE PREWITT,💯% smooth transparency
RUBEN DE LEON,"It's been painfully ineffective in trying to conduct business with Millennium Trust. The web interface customer service create work loops that have to resolve. In comparison with another company that I did an almost identical transaction happened in a matter of a few steps. With Millennium, I am into my 2nd month of trying to do something VERY SIMPLE."
Green,"The staff were so friendly and helpful, i had to call twice and both times they stayed on the phone with me while i completed the forms online, at was a great experence!"
TAYLOR CHAPMAN,Millennium Trust was very easy to use and the woman I spoke with on the phone was very helpful to me in the difficult decision to distribute my IRA.
ISREAL CHAMBERS,You dropped the ball on transferring money to my Schwab account.
RACHELA LEVINSON,I am severely displease with the fact the very small amount of money from the 401k that was never supposed to have been sent to this bank. I was charged fees on money that was parked in addition to not allowing me to correct the name in the bank information as I had gotten divorce and dropped the married name. their chat does not provide the customer service needed either.
RONALD HAMILTON,BJ The person that helped me on the phone was the BEST and a pitt stealer fan like me. Helped me beyond what I expected.
ALERIC SOULE,It nice to speak to representative. I don’t like how I had to do everything online
RICHARD ROSARIO,"The world would be a better place if this company went out of business. They fail at their basic functions.  UX is terrible, confusing and difficult to navigate. Customer service is awful. Their fees are ridiculous. I can’t wait to unwind my investments and close my account permanently."
DEAN HENDZEL,DeMone I talked with exceedingly helpful and answered all  my questions
DON WOODS,I have been waiting over 14 days for my prepaid debit card. When I call the number you sent me for help on this issue “I get nowhere” I also tried sending a email to the address you provided and I have no response.
TONY WILLIAMS,"I have contacted Millennium twice trying to set up access to my account online.  Although I have gone through the steps and set up the online account, I still cannot access it.  I called again on Monday and the rep was unable to tell me why I could not access the account and was going to find out and call me back.  4 business days later and I have yet to hear from you regarding how to get my account working.  I am taking my business elsewhere, the customer service is deplorable."
BRENDA MENDOZA,Representative was extremely insightful and helpful in the onboarding process.
CARLOS WONG,Easy to understand in order to choose the best option for your investment without having to speak with a representative
ASHLEY LYNN,"THE LADY I SPOKE WITH NAME IS ALISHA.THANK YOU, ALISHA, FOR SUCH GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE.YOUR PROFESSIONALISM IS A VERY WELCOMING EXPERIENCE.KEEP UP THE GREAT JOB."
SUSAN ELLISON,Took too long to transfer 401k funds. Took too long to get answers.
Antoineeta Barker,Good service but should be easier to get to talk to an agent.
LISA,"The issue with the automation is receiving notification that I needed to ""log in"" to complete, but when going to the site - there were still ""holds"" so I could not log in.  Since the representatives take calls (but are not the document reviewers), what I thought would take a day or two took a little over a week. Misunderstanding of automated emails after talking to a representative led to a longer wait time for processing necessary documents to access account. All has been resolved, and the on call reps along with the quick response to the email reply corrected the situation."
WESLEY SHEPPARD,Outstanding and friendly service. Thank you.
ALLISON EDDY,easy to handle online and fast turn around time
JOSEPH RHODY,The person assisting me was very helpful and knowledgeable. I also thank her for her patience. Very nice person. Thank you so very much!
Sherry Schmidt,"I was very pleased on how easy it was to work with customer care. They were  understanding, Went over the details many times so I could make the right choice. Made it easy.  Thank You"
JASON SCHAEFER,"The experience was great and fast.  Initially,  I  was not able to access my account.  Once I requested for my money,  the transaction went fast.  Thank you."
Lisamarie U,Was un aware that I had an account and they still charged me to close it out
JONATHAN KING,"It was an easy, painless process, and it surprised me.  So thank you for being so efficient with what I needed."
HOLLY MCDONALD,Geoff helped my wife and I consolidate our 401k plans from prior employers into one less accounts.  We had lost track of two of the plans but Geoff worked to find where the funds had been transferred to and now we can track these plans for our future!
GERALD MICHAELS,Yes it was simple and they responded very quick
DOUGLAS BROWNEN,Great costumer service and I feel at ease with my money being in Millennium Trust
LELYS JORGENSON,Poor company. Too difficult to get my funds.
Joan Hulihan,The process went smoothly once I got the correct information. It would have been nice to speak with a live person to get the information.

ZACHARY SURQUE,"Was given clear instructions,no complaints from me,and above all no frustration.The video was very helpful too."
DOROTHY GOODING,Excellent customer support and follow through.
THOMAS FRANKI,"I called in and spoke to a woman about getting my money rolled over. She said it was done online and that she would send instructions to my email. She never did. I guess she didn’t like it when she asked me to spell my email address to her, which wasn’t hard to figure out and I refused to. It was two common words followed by a number. Not very difficult. So with no instructions being sent, I had to figure it out myself. I did it myself. Thanks customer service for doing nothing for me. I love the message you get saying that you are extremely busy and the gold times are long. I never waited more than 20 seconds to speak to someone. Update your phone messages please."
BRYAN ANDRESKY,Not friendly cold and distance and I was left confused and flustered
LUDIVINA RIVERA,"The last lady I spoke with on the phone was great, but the three star review is because I had called a week prior about accessing my account, and the representative I spoke to on that occasion was not helpful and seemingly did not know what they were doing. I submitted all required documentation to identify myself, but the initial information I filled out to open my account was incorrect because my place of employment filed my SSN wrong. The system did not recognize me or identify my account unless I used the incorrect SSN on file. Well after I submitted proof of my SSN I had to resubmit that request form again with the correct SSN to process my request to access my account. This person did not know, and told me everything was fine and to just wait it out.  The only reason it was dealt with properly was because I called back the following week presenting my situation again to someone else. It could have ended up much more frustrating because all of that is time sensitive and would need to be resubmitted if deadline was not met. The representative led me to believe nothing was needed further to process, which was not correct. Just seems like further training is needed for representatives, as I pay an annual fee for account management through your company."
TONETTA COAXUM,I appreciated the simple process.
AMANDA MCINTOSH,"Millinium trust made my transaction quick,easy and painless!"
KYASHARA GARNER,re website is difficult to navigateit is not clear howto set up a new accountthey say place your 8 digit account number under your name left hand corner-it is a 9 digit numberwhen you fill out the customer information and are on the last page instructions say click next to get to main page-there is no NEXT to click on
KWATSOO OKANG,I don't have enough experience with you to make an honest review of your services. My former employer gave you my account after I quit and you sent me a letter telling me about it. I asked for my money and haven't gotten it yet. That's all.
MARGARITA VACA PALOMINO,The service person was able to explain everything and help me through the application process
Margie Mitchell,It was a very easy process to close my account.
VICTORIA S.,My representative was very helpful and got me all the information I needed!
DESMOND NORMAN,I requested a distribution check from a Ira. They were very helpful with the whole process. Thank you.
JAMALL CLARK,Charged $800 in holding fees and gained nothing in 4 years. W T F ?
MAX OWENS,Im waiting for my card at last 15 days now.It’s a bad choice to have some company holding your money.
Irwin Kahn,I feel like I didn’t get any help with trying to get my account transferred into my new 401 K account
REBECCA COLLINS,Too much red tape to move my money around
MICHAEL,I took money out of my plan for home improvement. I used to website to take the money out and I found it very easy. I’m very satisfied with Millenium.
VANESSA V,"Impatient customer service agent and inconsistent instructions and guidance form USPS mail communications, electronic communications, chat communications, and phone call (automated & in-person) communications. Basically, everyone/everything told me something different. ""It shouldn't be this hard."""
KEVIN HOLBROOK,Man I spoke with was completely rude and unhelpful.
RITA KACZMAREK,Great and fast service! Very easy to use!
CRISTINA ESPINO TRISTAN,I'm not sure why you are not behind bars yet.
Frustrated,Takes 10-12 days for a distribution when other companies process them in 24-48 business hours. 10-12 days is absolutely asinine. Pulling all of my money and putting elsewhere
Tiffany Pittman,Customer service was great and very respectful
MICHAEL PARKEY,I haven’t received the money yet but a lot of help. How long does it take to get my money?
Harry Purdy,Retirement fund dropped 33 percent in 3 years. Not pleased.
YOLANDA PHELPS,"I'm new to Millennium Trust, but so far the site it pretty user friendly once I got some direction from Millennium Trust personnel."
Jeff,good service so far
Datorrie,"Exorbitant fees for transactions, transfers, and closing of accounts.  If you want to keep your money, stay away from this company."
Priti Lobo,The service rep stayed on the line with me until I had completed the process.
Imani Norwood,"Using the web site was so easy! I loathed having to make a withdrawal from my 401k , but looking around on the website I saw how easy it was! It will be just as easy to repay what I borrowed too!! I highly recommend this company."
OSMEL COMPANIONI NAPOLES,"The lady that helped me was SUPER,SUPER kind and patient and helpful!!"
WILLY,"My T.Row Price account was sent to this company  after I quit a job. My last statement showed one amount and Millennium had a different lesser amount. Then I decided to close the account and at the very end, they tell you that they will gladly charge you $25 to close the account. Unnecessary charge when I had to fill out all the paperwork despite having had just created and updated my new account profile. So yeah. Not happy with them. But I will be done with them shortly."
CIERRA SOLE PARNOSKY,Very easy to deal with and made things clear
ANDREW NELSON,"While it took some time to connect to with a person, I had a exceptional positive experience"

ALEJANDRO ESPINO-HERNANDEZ,"The website, sign up and sign in process was very smooth, informative and easy to navigate. I look forward to working with Millennium trust into the future."
Yvonne Bonfield,"The website is very slow and I've been trying to transfer my funds into a rollover IRA.  When I get to that part of the website, the website gets stuck in a loop and eventually times out.  I've tried this numberous times today and keep getting the same result.  Also, unlike other companies, Millenium wants you to initiate the transfer on the website instead of allowing you the option on the phone.  Lots of red tape and issues to make a transfer to another company a real hard and long task.  Not very customer service oriented."
KEVIN GODBEE,"I had all kinds of glitchy problems trying to log in. I got the help I needed to navigate, cheerfully and quickly."
No name,"Hello- I have had a Self-directed IRA with MT since 2007. I  will not complain about the company itself. However, the people you hire represent the company! I have to say each call I've made, which were not many, to MT, customer service was not too polite. Always seem very abrupt and dry. I feel as though I'm holding them up from something more important. Today for instance, I had to pull/force rep to speak and offer more info...):😒😔Please be advised, I am not angry just disappointed."
YUDIANTO HALIM,I called for clarification on account access and also for distribution types. My inquiries were answered quite quickly. Very pleased.
Leonila Ramos,Sandra helped me get my money moved over to Fundrise.  It was not issue that Millennium Trust caused but one that was on the Fundrise end.  She helped get me in touch with the Fundrise rep and sorted it all out!!
BENNIE MUNOZ,The web site was customer friendly and easy to use with understandingi had no problems using their system.
STORME,"My employer had rolled over some money from an old account I had when my mill shut down. I guess I never paid any attention to it because I didn't realize I had any money in an IRA account. Millennium Trust went out of their way and tracked down my new address (I have since moved after my mill shut down) and sent me a letter explaining that I had money in an account. I ended up withdrawing it because I already have a 401k with my current employer. But what I will say is how quick, easy and painless that process was. I'm sure Millennium Trust is a great company and me withdrawing my money is by no means a reflection of any service I received. I took it out to take care of a bill that was weighing pretty heavily on me. Their letter explaining everything came at a time when I really needed it. I appreciate them reaching out and I have nothing but good things to say."
DN,The online process was extremely tedious. The representative assisting us was very pleasant to work with. But even with the representative's assistance the process was very confusing and counter intuitive.

Angela E.,I enjoy my experience on how to select the best for my retirement
Kristina Castro,Making a withdrawal  on line was simple  for this  tech challenged senior and received direct deposit within 3 days
MILAGROS ONEAL,"I spent an hour and a half on hold hearing about the company's ""experience and expertise"", waiting to talk to someone about a roll-over request (AFTER SPENDING 2 HOURS ON THE WEBSITE IN MY ACCOUNT TRYING TO HANDLE IT), and I finally got in touch with a curt woman who told me that I had to go BACK to the website again and re-do the whole process, because the option is hidden within a ridiculous menu option.Can't wait to get my money out of here."
LYNETTE RAGBEER,"Horrible customer service!  Went to transfer funds to my self-directed LLC and needed to fill out Purchase Direction form along with Fee Compensation Letter and wiring instructions.  I sent it all in and received an email from David thanking me for sending it all in along with a request for me to call in and verify the wiring instructions.  All good so far.  But then when I called in, David claimed he never received it.  So I asked him, why did you send me an email saying you received it?  To which he replied he must have lost it.  Are you kidding me?  So I sent it again, he received it, he verified the wiring instructions and told me it would be processed that day (Friday).  Well it wasn't processed.  So on Monday morning I called and talked to Melanie and she talked to Sarah in Processing, and they assured me it would be processed by end of day.  Well, end of day came and went, still not processed.  So I called again, after talking to Melanie, she put me through to Sarah who explained she didn't get to it.  Again, are you kidding me?  I've now been told that it will be processed tomorrow.  We'll see..."
JASON BRIDGES,Took forever for funds to roll over ridiculous 6 days so far since they received all authorization and still not even on review. Then it takes 20 days after that.  Worst company ever
Juana De la Rosa,"Sandra and Samson teamed up immediately to provide a solution to my issue with an outside IRA transfer providing me with a calendar and email to follow up when I had time.This kind of investor relationship will win the day. Overall, extremely positive, friendly, solution based conversation in less than 5 minutes. Quick impact, keep up the good work."

Larenzo Giden,Overall very good. The process with Crowdstreet needs documenting.
NENNA WHITE,"First attempt calling at getting my money, it stated I had to do it online.  I tried it online, then it said I had to call to complete because it came up with an error.  I waited a few days retried online and it worked, but I lost a little bit more of money due to the wait, which I wasn't happy with considering the amount was little to begin with."
JENNIFER BOWMAN,"Very fast, easy to work with and the online service was quick and efficient"

Curtis Sorrow,I did not join Millennium Trust. My account was transferred without my consent and changed from a 401k to an IRA. This along with my personal information that went with it is a violation of the 4th AMENDMENT.
GAUTAM PAI,"It was really easy and quick, i understood everything i was asked, and was very simple on what i needed to do"
MATTHEW GARDNER,They were very professional and helpful from the beginning of the call to the end.
ELISABETH BALSZ,Agent was very helpful and patient.
DERRICK MINTAH,Account updates and fees are terrible.   Do not recommend.
Patrick,Terrible company to work with. They are nonresponsive and when they do they require you to send the same forms more than three times because they can't get their act together. Please use a different company and save yourself some aggregation!
BELINDA SHORT,"Too many hoops to jump through in order to access my account!!!!  I could not get a customer service agent on the phone.   Trying to bypass the automatic greeting was VERY hard.  I want to be able to talk to an agent when I don't have a simple question for the automatic voice to handle, and your company could not get this done for me.On the + side, the customer service agent I did FINALLY connect with was patient with me when my blood pressure was through the roof due to my frustrations."
VS,Excellent service and fast
BrianM,Lady was very helpful and nice in explaining my account. She also helped me with my distribution and how to do it online. It was nice to deal with pleasant customer service!

Michael Value Driven,"Great company, just wish they could process my 401k a little faster."

Miguel Perez,The site is not the easiest to use and not able to use on your phone at all.
PRECIOUS,never receive the email to try to fix my password
MORGAN CAHN,"Very helpful, descriptive and precise.  Made My experience very easy!"
THERESA   EGAN,"I was called by Jessica today on our home phone.  I returned the call at the number she gave and waited FOURTY FIVE minutes of a response.  Finally the person said I should be transferred to a senior representative.  When she transferred me the system said ""sorry we are too busy"" and...click."
Judith Brinegar,"The people I spoke to are pleasant but I feel like I wasn’t given correct or complete information when I called the first time three weeks ago trying to get into my account online. Then when I called this time, they Pushed me through the phone call, obviously trying to get me off the phone fast and not solve my problem until I protested. Now I have access but I don’t like to get pushy to have someone listen."
CAROLYN EMBERLEY,"The online platform is horrible. I STILL don't know how to access a monthly statement. You automated phone service was so bad, i requested communication via e-mail. At one point, I was asked to provide a password I was never given. When I did speak with a human being, she was helpful, and professional. I don't understand why trying to consolidate this puny IRA has been such a headache."
CRYSTAL H,No one notified me of creating account when I received the letter it was 3 weeks after account being created. Making it so I would not be able to get my full investment. The letter states within 7 days the company is sure to notify you by mail well after receiving and setting up account.
STEVEN COHLMIA,"Extremely easy to complete a transaction online - simple and fast, also with quick results.  Far exceeds some competitors!"
FRANCISCO TINAJERO,Overall Account lookup process was simple! Website is laid out very well and easy to follow!
JULIE DAVIDSON,I think your processes are too slow. I also think we should be able to set up a speedier system once cash hits our account to be transferred out. We seem to be paying for a trustee service that doesn't provide a good customer experience
DEBRA JOHNSON,The person I spoke with was great. Very pleasant and friendly. I feel bad I forgot her name.
ROXANA SIMS,I have sent in my SS card twice to verify and a letter from the bank twice to get my money and still haven't heard anything. My fellow employee did hers the same day as me and she didn't have to have any type of verification and had her money in her account within two days.

N SILVA,"Two of the representatives that I talked to were very rude and didn't seem to care about helping me. I was having trouble confirming my identity even though I had submitted my documentation via the website and had saved the tracking numbers. It was evident that both representatives hated their job and weren't even remotely interested in trying to help me find a solution. When they explained what went wrong, it was difficult to follow. It didn't seem to me like they were well trained because they fumbled over their words. However, I do have to give kudos to Grear. She was amazing! We lost connection once, and she called me back right away. While one of the rude representatives did not call me back when either she hanged up or lost connection."
Ethan,I appreciate the timely and accurate level of service.  Thanks!
DARRELL WALKER,Customer service was very knowledgeable and extremely helpful
Ariel L Hong,"I requested the money in my IRA and I completed the online application. I was honestly surprised of the simplicity of the application and the entire process in comparison to other institutions I have been dealing with. Millennium Trust responded to my request immediately and within 2 to 3 days the money was deposited directly in my account.  What was most amazing they sent me emails to keep me updated and tracking number in the event I needed to follow up, but there was no need to contact them again.  The process was brief and hassle free from start to finish.  Thank you.  What a great experience."
CHERYL BARNETT,I called the wrong department but that didn't stop the assistance. She walked me through how to process the disbursement and saved me almost two weeks of waiting. Thank you so much for your help!
LISA HILLYER,The employee I spoke with on the phone was very courteous and very helpful in guiding me on the website.  She was a the best customer service rep I have run across in a long time.  Patient and very knowledgeable.Thank you!

BLANCA LISSONA,friendly service! good job!

S. ROBINSON,It was very easy to follow the process of my needs. Also the personal was very patient with me and guide me through the process.. thank you so much

VINCENT CAMPISI,"After my 401K was ‘acquired’ by MTrust and had to pay fees to get my remaining funds, I get notice that they have taken over PayFlex HSA. Sadly Health Saving Account funds are not transferable unless in a current high deductible plan. I now have to work with these people again…UGH!"
DUSTIN KUHN,"Wanted to rollover an IRA that was automatically transferred to your company however telephone representatives are not able to help, everything has to be done online.  As mentioned, my account was automatically transferred and I would have preferred to have it go to my existing IRA at another firm. Now I have to pay a fee to establish an account with you, pay a fee to close it, and hopefully NOT pay an annual fee."
Jorge Diaz,"My employee transferred my 401K  account with this institution,  without even know Millennium Trust hit me with a year fee, I have an IRA with Fidelity for more than 20 years and they never ever charged me any annual fee to keep my account , neither AmeriTrade, this company is a fraud.  They charged for everything, even to move my money  with Fidelity.   I don't recommend MT to no body.   ADIOS!!!!!"
CEDRIC WILLIAMS,"My 401K was moved to this company without my authorization.  I understand that previous employer initiated the transfer, but I did not authorize them to do that either.  I should have been properly contacted, so that I can handle my funds as I deem appropriate."
ADRIANA SANCHEZ,Good great service. Thank you
LANCE MACIOCE,"Very unclear explanations and in the end I was told that everyone is spammed with a notice stating that they should wait for a 1099-R and important tax information for closing an account. I never received a form so called asking about this, I was told to ignore the email that it isn't relevant for my taxes."
IO,Frank did an excellent work to walk me through for a direct rollover. Thanks.
Lstewart,After being terminated from my job last year there was a simple transition to withdraw my funds for access as needed.

Leroy Anderson,Easy to work with. Great communication.
JOHN JORDAN,Thanks for the help
GEORGE SCHOLL,"Neah, the agent, was rude. She didn't listen and therefore didn't understand why I was calling (which was to ensure I provided you an accurate address for the rollover to the TSP). She then was discernably angry when I tried to clarify why I was calling."
Nancy Reed,"Great customer service from ""Bailey"". She was polite,personable, well-spoken, patient, knowledgeable, efficient. She got my questions answered. Thank you"
SHERILYN BARDESSONO,"My 401k was rolled over without notice to me. These clowns charge huge fees for everything. Once I went to pullout, boom, another few for closing everything out electronically. What a joke."
customer,"Your IRA rollover time is to long, a 20 day transfer period is excessive. Also Most wealth management companies send their paperwork to a customer's preferred fiduciary to handle."
RAMESH KALRA,The lady that helped me was very patient and let me vent to her. She was kind and also fixed my mistakes. She also called me back to make sure that everything was all set.
Carmel,Relatively secure platform.Easy process to get a disbursement check. Would be nice if I could access my full account number from the online portal.  It's obscured everywhere.
WARREN HUFFMAN,So refreshing to talk to a real live person when help is needed. My issue was solved completely and quickly. Thank you.
JOHN YELEY,too long in the waiting query to get an answer and no option of calling back later.

Kellie Case,"The transfer into Millennium from Fidelity of this account was not completed on schedule.  Upon my initial contact, I was advised that Millennium could not discuss as they had no info.  Once receipt was confirmed, Millennium could not process a transfer out into an existing IRA account held at another custodian before 20 business days have elapsed.  No, the service and timing are far from satisfactory."
Marcelyn Melaas,Super easy & friendly service.
Kassie,Was easy to collect my leftover 401k money from a prior employer.
Jerry Smith,"The website was a little confusing, but ultimately I found the link to where I needed to go to close the account/withdraw once filling out the info."
JOHN CUNNINGHAM,Excellent customer service and representative was very pleasant to talk to
ZACHARY ZAWISZA,"My original investment started at over $500. In a few years, it dwindled down to $150 all due to fees. This company did nothing for my investment probably due to it being a smaller amount… disappointing there was ZERO positive return to even cancel out a fee."
STAR PEREZ,For my transition the online process was great to use.  It is not easy getting there as new member without a sign on. Having a real person to talk to initially would help.
CASANDRA WALKER,All the staff members were inviting and helpful
DES,"Millennium Trust was costing me $50 per year to manage my small amount of money, and no transactions were occurring.When I decided it was time to stop losing money, I created an account and drew out the money. Millennium was fabulous through this process. There were security measures to be sure it was really me, and everything went very smoothly and quickly! I would highly recommend Millennium Trust for the right situation (mine really was not)."
RICHARD NICKUM,"Everything about the process of opening and closing my account was terrible. Had multiple glitches, couldn’t talk to a human and was a total pain in the ass. I will never use this outfit again."
NELSON PEREZ,"HI,My call was answered in a very timely manner.  The woman who helped me (I apologize I did not catch her name) was extremely pleasant, patient and helpful.  My issue was fully resolved quickly.Thank you,"
Kathy,The customer service man that I talked with was not very helpful and is attitude was very bad. I have worked at a bank for 22 years he acted like we knew nothing about doing IRA rollovers . Hopefully we did it correctly but haven’t heard anything back yet .
Donald Dietrichson,I was not happy to be on hold for 45 minutes before reaching a representitive.
DeWeese,I found the online plan to be quick and easy to manage

JAMES MURPHY,"Simple account sign up, except for my phone trying to type my password backwards instead of forwards, but the instructions on the mailer you sent me on how to create a profile were easy to follow, and I look forward to working with you in the future as I learn what to do with my nest egg, and building my retirement portfolio."
REBECCA BAUM,"I randomly found out I had an account with Millennium from back in 2013. I called them, logged in, and transferred it to my checking account. 48 hours later I had 3k in my bank! It was super easy! Thanks guys!"
ZT,I was notified I had money in an acct with millennium from a company I hadn't worked for in over 10 years. I contacted the company & asked to just have the money sent to me. I received the money in less than 3 weeks. Very professional staff
Gary Bender,The  service was great they quick to respond and very helpful.
Timothy Childress,nothing happen...
ISEU DALARMI,"I feel that I have been cheated, swindled and robbed. Millennium Trust took my savings, pocketed a huge percentage without any reasonable explanation, and deposited only a small fraction of those funds into my account. This is outrageous!"
MARK,Very great customer service . Nice and polite .
PATRILLA THOMPSON,"Website is not easy to navigate. I was directed to Millenium site since I resigned from my previous employer and my 401K was sent here but upon contacting customer service was given this website but no instructions on what to do for a rollover to new employer. I had to figure in my own how to navigate website & registration, etc and even at end since I had so much trouble, my new employer’s 401k company (Principal) helped me with my rollover. All this company really cares about is money they get, not customers."
MICHAEL KING,"I am trying to go to ""Distribution of Funds"" and roll over my entire fund to my current 401K plan. The website was NOT allowing me to do that. When I put in my name, year of birth and last 4 of my SS#, I click on CONTINUE and the website keeps on cycling, coming back to the same exact spot as before. Having spoken to one of your representatives about 2 weeks ago, she had no idea as to how to help me. Hence, I was stuck and not being able to advance here.Finally, I talked with another rep and she cancelled my older request, replacing it with the new one. I am thankful to the support staff and satisfied that it fixed the issue, but it could have been a less frustrating experience for me if it was fixed earlier. Also, I believe there may be a possible software bug with this issue I was experiencing."
KERRY Alexander,very nice and kind people. very good customer service
Kathleen Welch,My experience with MT has been fast and easy. I spoke with Bailey who walked this boomer thru all the steps needed to complete my transaction. She was easy to understand and and very helpful.

KARLENA NELSON,I was having trouble filling out a withdrawal form I had called several times one person told me that I would have my money with in 72 business hours the last person I talked to said that it could take up 5 - 7 days. I needed that money for some  personal issue.
Mitch,I have requested disbursement of my 401K funds and it has been 15 business days and still no money has hit my account. I have done business with both Vanguard and Fidelity and it has never taken this long to get my money disbursement. Your competitors only take 2-3 business days to disburse payment. You need to change your business practices.
oumou Sissoko ,Quick call back and all information needed was supplied.
TRAVIS CELESTINE,"Navigating online isn't senior nor disabled friendly. It also doesn't easily allow you to correct accidental errors. I understand the need for security; but, there should be a less stressful way to navigate, and an immediate access to a LIVE representative if needed or preferred"
Francis,"Reps we’re extremely nice, patient, professional and knowledgeable."
CHRISTIAN OBRIEN,"i likes the ease of their website, encountered no issues"

DEREK FLOYD,The individual who assisted me made my confusing issue easy to resolve I thank her dearly for her patience.
GERALD BARRY,My account was transferred to you automatically and i strongly disagree with having to pay a maintenance fee and a fee to close the account.
WILLIAM SCHULZ,The service was quick and the funds arrived in my account within 3 days.
THOMAS STECKLER,"Millennium Trust took 50% of my principal amount in fees.  I do not believe there are any other firms taking such high fees.  My principal amount was low, and there is no mechanism for them to see that they have TAKEN ALL OF ONE'S MONEY; and they do not seem to care.This is outrageous and it must be called to the attention of regulators and legislators.  It may not bother someone with a huge principal amount, this happened to be a small one - IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE AND MORALLY BANKRUPT. I have asked for the fees to be replaced to my account.  Of course there would be no appreciation as they kept siphoning out as much as they could.  OUTRAGEOUS."
ALEX MENDOZA,"Tried to sign up, there system timed-out.  No idea where I am in there system."

COURTNEY,"I've been with this company for a few years now since they bought out my old Self-directed IRA company. I'll cut to the chase and let you know they are terrible! Their response time is horrific. If they say 3-7 days, you'll need to give them 3 weeks. They charge fees for everything and are great about making excuses with the most common one being, ""It is being processed"", which is really code for ""it's sitting on someone's desk."" I can't transfer my accounts from them fast enough!"

MOKENA BROOKS,"I filled out the proper forms to have my rollover retirement money from a previous job deposited into my bank account. After a couple days MT informed me they had sent my money to the bank, so I waited a day or two and contacted my bank. The bank said the money had not been sent. After emailing back and forth I was able to get Brenda, an actual human from MT, on the phone. Brenda informed me that MT sent my money to my bank and the bank sent it back to them, it will be $30 charge for having to send it twice. Okay whatever fine, just send it again. They said they needed me to send them a voided check to make sure the account number and all is correct. So I sent the check to them last week and have sent a couple follow up emails. No response from them since I sent the check. So now MT has my retirement money AND my bank information. If I don't hear back soon I guess I will have to close my bank account and open a new one. Then hire a lawyer to get my money from them. As far as I can tell, this company sucks."
TRACY WILLIAMS,Long delay to make a withdrawal of funds.  17 days from when I complete the form and I still receive responses

Britney Love,Very trust worthy and quick on responding! I love this company
Christine Smith,"Great people, great site—only one issue to be aware of: when a new user, you are expected to either have an 8-digit code or fill out a short form; if you use the 4 field form, you have to NOT click on the Sign In text link directly below it. Instead, they expect you to click the green Next button at the very bottom right corner—easy to miss it unless you know to look there. Phone rep says that they get calls about this issue ALLLLL the time so it ought to be corrected to save time and money. I’m a UX designer and these painpoints are costly!"
Randy Sheler,Didn't know I had that much...Thanks for the experience you all that Dollar tree has given me for working with the company.....
KEM HASBROUCK,thanks for the help
Casey Ridgway,The woman who helped me walked me through it and stayed on the phone with me to check accuracy from her end. I finally got transactions completed. I’d tried at least five times before and was blown off by the other reps

KEITH SCHWIETHALE,Everyone eas helpful and friendly
DOUGLAS MURRY,"Our IRA money was transferred to Millennium without our approval. It's been almost two months, at least a dozen phone calls (or phone call mazes), and we still haven't got access to our funds, or even found anyone at the company who knows where they are. Are they tying peoples' IRA money up in their own investments? Are they fundraising with it? And what's more, with hundreds of similar complaints posted on the BBB, the BBB rates them an A+. So, two winning companies. I'd like to give them both -5."
JASON B,"Had a really great experience website is easy to navigate. The customer service is great. Had money rolled over from a previous employer. I am leaving them because I am rolling my money over to my now current employer, but if I had the opportunity to use them again I will."

GALANDA A BROOKER,"I needed to claim a ira from a old job. I had been putting it off due to anxiety . However, from the claiming of the account to the disbursement was painless and took a little amount of time. If I knew it was going to be such a smooth process I would have done it alot sooner."
JARRET DILL,Fantastic Customer Service! Immediately understood my challenge and presented me with the correct solution. Thank you!
Sherri Sandoval,Got some good advice on tracking down a wire.
David Healey,"Our agent was extremely friendly, fast, and knowledgeable.Thanks!!"
MARQUISE Melton,"I called their phone number, was asked if I wanted a link to their website texted to me so I could create an account. Link was sent, easily created an account and took care of my business. All in all, a seamless experience - especially for not having spoken with an actual person. I’m usually somewhat unreceptive and slightly hostile to automated customer service. I’ve been a customer service supervisor for years, and am put off when I don’t actually talk to a human. But in this case, it worked out very well."
SIENNA ABER,"I am not the most computer savvy,  however your  ustomer service person who helped me was the best. I told her and I meant it, I wouldn't have been able to complete everything without her."

anna m kukla,"The absolutely worst experience I've ever had trying to roll-over my 401k with a former employer.  Boarder-line fraudulent and I'm likely going to be contacting the authorities given the level of resistance, inaccurate steps, and number of iterations Millenium Trust has put up as I've attempted to roll-over my balance into a traditional IRA."

I spoke with Alisha (sic?)this morning and she helped me set up access to my account.  She was wonderful!!!  I am old school and like to speak with a real person.  Afterwards the automated set up was easy and quick.  I am very happy with this experience."
Vicki Wade,"I requested to withdraw my money, and received it very very quickly!!!!  Very happy with your efficiency in taking care of my request promptly."
Bill,I had stopped contributing to my account once I was released from my job.  I had moved multiple times since 2016 and somehow this company was able to track me and inform me of the status of my account.  I had completely forgotten about it and I'm amazed their dedication towards me

RAH,The lady DJ sorry if I say her name wrong but she helped me and stayed on the phone and follow me through the whole process. She’s the best.
DHANANJAY VEMURI,"David was not only thorough, but also patient and listened to me. Something that is not necessarily common in the CS industry. He then took the necessary steps to make sure that everything possible was being done to make MT come through - and they did. Side note, the original CS did everything proper, but David used his permissions to do even more. Couldn’t be happier with how they handled everything, and of course the results!"
LEOPOLDO LUCATERO,"Millennium Trust assisted me, efficiently in accomplishing some IRA transactions. Their staff were helpful and instructive regarding the process. Thank You Millennium Trust."

I will be moving EVERYThING away from them.  Absolutely the worst firm I have ever tried to work with.  Mike"
SUBHRAJIT GOON,A precise and faster explanation in terms easy to understand.
Yvonne Johnson,"after several years of not knowing where my money went i received a statement in the mail from them 6 years after i retired and they just keep taking money out and it was not making any money i lost 300 dollars to there account fees so i pulled all my money and thats when the barriers started its been 2 weeks and i still have not gotten my dividends they get your bank info and i know it only takes about an hourt to process but weeks later still nothing im sure they will say MORE PAPERWORK IS NEEDED , THAT SEEMS TO BE THERE GO TO FOR NOT DISTRIBUTING YOUR MONEY."
CARLA SANCHEZ,The agent was amazing. All I did was tell him I want to roll over 2 old 401k  he made all the calls and got everything done with me on the line verifying my identity.  This stressful situation went so smooth I wish I had done this 5 years ago.

RENE WINN,My transfer was completed within 2-3 days. Happy customer
DONNA HAIRSTON,"Your company has never reached out to me to see how I feel about my investment. I have to reach out to you, I suppose in some world that makes sense. Especially since I have consistently lost money. Anyway ,maybe you do better with millionaires. To bad as I have several investments and this one is very small thank goodness."
DAVID,Terrible - through and through. Waste of time and energy getting anything to work.
CARLOS CARNEY,"Submitted a request to transfer some funds to my Schwab account, not the first time.  Received an email asking me to contact the company.  Called and waited on hold for over 15 mins, spoke with the rep.  She asked some questions and said the funds would be released.  A few weeks later Schwab called me and said the transfer had been declined until l contacted Millennium.  Called them back, been on hold for over 1/2 and hour...   Ridiculous."
MARYJANE CONNELL,Less than 24-hour turnaround for an online request. Very happy with the service.
BRENDA MARTINEZ,I was unable to provide passphrase. There is no hint to help with passphrase. The link I was provided to change passphrase locked my account out even though I was positive I entered the correct information. I submitted paperwork through mail and they weren’t able to tell my why I had to call to finish the transfer.
Debra,I spoke to a representative this morning she was going to send me a link to reset my password still haven’t received it. Unable to access my account.
TIFFANY CRAYCRAFT,"The website helped me walk through setting up one account successfully and was easy to navigate. Then I ran into a website glitch and needed help with the second account. My customer service agent stayed with me to help me get a second account set up, and registered. She also let me know that they are working to fix the glitch, so my feedback was helpful. She reported the two issues to the technical team and was able to help me finish my account setup."
Raul Lopez,I wasn’t able to log in IRA for several months.Peggy has been very helpful and patient. She  also emailed me about the investment instructions.
KEELEY STAMPS-PENNOCK,Too complicated and poor service. Cannot find out anything about my investment. I haven’t received anything for 3 years now and I get nowhere with the computer or the phone. Just keep lying.

Millennium has too many different sites which confuses me! Your company should be easier to work with online!
MI,Taking a withdrawal from a contribution seemed pretty easy!

JAMES JOHNSON,I’m waiting to receive a payout of my retirement funds from Wilbur Smith Associates as requested on 3/4/22 but the process was easy and the people were helpful.
JUSTIN BLITCH,"The most confusing and ridiculous process of trying to get my money sent back to me. Vague and evasive. Seems as though under the guise of security they make it so aggravating that you will hopefully leave your money there for them to profit from. It took over 45 minutes just to register and I still don’t have a definitive idea as to when the funds will be returned to me. Frustrating to say the least. Don’t call the either, they’re rude and less than helpful when trying to figure out how to request a simple payout. They also try to say it will take an additional 20 days to do anACH transfer which is absurd, nothing takes that long anymore. It’s a stall tactic to keep their bank account fat for interest sweeps."
ROBERT SNYDER,~ Efficient but I wish areal person would answer the calls after 5 mins.
Julie Schossow,Needing distribution of IRA to bank account. Everyone at Millennium was very helpful in guiding me through the online process. Thank you very much to everyone.
Danny Hicks,very easy to work with and quick response
Viktoria Feikert,I cashed out my account which was fairly quick and easy. But was charged $25 to close an account that you only had for a week maybe 2.
Maria G,How much do you all charge to get my own money 525 to 450 like wow 😡😡😡
Darian Penny,Easy to work with and got things done quickly for me!
Stanley Black,All this company did was take my money in fees.  It went from almost 1000 to 589. They didnt make me any money and wouldn't transfer my money to another retirement.  So I just took it out.  Ridiculous!!
Former account holder.,"I had recently left my employer, and had honestly forgotten about my investments, so they were turned over to Millennium Trust, and put into a ""holding account"". I had spoken to, only two people that, first explained what had happened, and where they were, and the second, took all of my information that she needed to liquidate my savings to me, and it only took 2 days, if I remember correctly, that it was in my bank account, so firstly, I would like to thank you for people are knowledge about your services, and also their customer service, that I received, because they were both very pleasant. I would definitely recommend Millinium Trust to my colleagues and friends."
KLK,Have not been able to get ahold of someone for a week now. Called during hours and it said the best time to reach us is 5p-8p cst for now you’ll have to talk to the robot and the robot couldn’t help. I called between 5p-8p and it said its after business hours. Very frustrated so far.

Aimee,Not sure if this company is based in Chicago but customer service is poor. Tried to get a better understanding of my account and get more information about my options and was made to be felt like i was wasting the representative's breath by having to repeat some of the info.

I received the check today and will proceed to send it to my new retirement plan.  Thank you again!"

JUSTIN CLARK,"I still have not received my monies.  Rick Meyers, 303-619- 7458"

The more difficult you make it, the more reasons I have to consider other options. I know that this eould not change anything but I had to mentioned. Closing my small account as soon as I figure out the phrase."
JOSE HERNANDEZ,Had an old IRA not being utilized therefore decided to close it.  Nothing personal.  The website was remarkably easy to use though.
DAKOTA NEILL,Rude phone agent. Had to ask for supervisor
LOCEAN,I asked to cash out an account and have not received my payment I would an update
ANDREW BICKFORD,The online transaction was very easy and self explanatory.

TRACEY UBANII,"So kind and helpful ,very good service and help thnx"
LORENE WILLIAMS,"Quick, easy going and right to the point with more than enough help"
RONALD STEPHENS,It was super easy to take care of what I needed online.  It was a huge relief there was no hassle and so fast.
J R,The agent was very helpful and patient with all directions.
J. T. ,You didn’t send what was requested. I’m f I could give you 0 starts I would have
K O,"Poor customer service. Difficult website to navigate. When emailed instructions and/or links, instructions did not match what they wanted and link did not take you to the appropriate place to do what they are asking. Glad to be leaving! They do not communicate issues with accounts. They were charging an annual fee much larger than I was even making in interest...what a joke!"
Nubia Marin Valencia,I have nothing but good things to say when I call I wasn’t placed on hold very long my questions was answered and everyone I spoke with was very polite and professional I hope this has been the experience is for everyone not just me.
ALEXANDRIA BIBBS,"Response time is extremely slow, I’ll be glad when I’m done with this company"
SHELIA HULL,"Both agents, I’ve spoken to both were very friendly!"
DARIUSZ FURMANIAK,Obtaining access to account was way too complicated and customer service representative was not willing to help making things difficult. I was provided with the wrong information several times and they did not want to take ownership of the misinformation that was provided. Overall I would not recommend Millennium Trust to anyone and will not use in the future.
Mohamad Khalil,not the easiest site to use and communication sucks when needing stuff to finish starting account.
Dave,I spoke with a lady named Vicki from Chicago and she was impersonal and repeated questions like a robot. We got conveniently disconnected( I am quite sure she hung up on me) and I called back and talked to a guy named Tim I think from Pittsburgh. He was helpful but at a certain point he seemed to just want to get off the phone with me. Vicki could use some sensitivity training. She did not make me feel like doing business with Millennium Trust in the future. Tim was much kinder.
Christopher Harriman,"Jennifer was really helpful in getting my questions answered and providing me with clear information as to the transfer process. She also made sure I was aware of the current length of time it would take so there would be no surprises, which I extremely appreciate."
ELIZABETH TUFUOR,Great!! I love the process. Quick and efficient!
SUSAN BAER,Product was of good quality and received package quickly.
LISA BYWATERS,"I am so happy to write a review about the Customer Service Rep/Analyst who helped me today on 3/25/2022 at around 9:15am.Her name is Alicia and she was absolutely wonderful. She was friendly, attentive, and listened to my needs as a customer. This is absolutely the type of service I want when I speak to a rep. I worked in retail for 8 years, then in insurance for many years, and I completely understand how difficult it is to deal with customers sometimes. I am going through the process to register my 2 types of accounts which were automatically moved over to Millennium. (Roth and Regular)So far so good. I will wait for the next email.Please thank Alicia for her kindness and also laughter during the morning Friday hours.Sincerely,Gabrielle Brieger"

I activated one and am not able to access the other from the home page, no matter how I have tried to open it or the code I use I am brought back to the same incorrect page as before. Please fix the system."
LUIS HOWE L,The representative was helpful but getting to the representative through the automated system was such an arduous process. My issue couldn’t have been answered by the automated system and I needed an answer right away! It was easily answered by the rep and my conversation with the rep was actually shorter in duration than waiting on the phone
Carla Shobe,I received very poor customer service with no explanation of how anything worked. My account was transferred from another company and I could not get any answers. They claim it will take 20 business days to close out the account and send me my funds.
Shane,Excellent experience
JOSEPH MARTINEZ,Thank you so much for your continually trying to contact me. I finally responded and immediately you released the funds
Jacob Lujan,Thank you it was a seamless process. Easy to complete.

Bthomp,The customer service representative was the most helpful I have ever encountered!!  10 STARS!!!

VENICE MONROE,Long hold time and virtual assistance is terrible. Associate was great and very helpful!
Valerie,"Once online, easy to use website."
LARRY BAUER,Worst service ever. I'm told one thing on a call and next time something completely different.  I'm told I will receive an email and I do not get email.  I also have difficulty getting through because I was never given my account number.  Finally got it yesterday for the first time. I plan on filing a complaint as your company is either a scam or fraudulent. I have been trying to transfer out my money for months. Has not happened after multiple attempts.
KIMBERLY LOKEN,The website is straight forward and easy to navigate.
Displeased,I am a new customer with Millennium Trust I am having a hard time getting an confirmation email for my account every time I call there’s no human representative to talk to. I would like to speak to someone about my account. Maybe I should transfer my funds to another company.
SAMANTHA NICHOLAS,I’m happy. I’m thankful.
GAIL ROATEN,Millennium made it easy to rollover an old 401K to my new employer!
Chris Ater,"Easy to navigate on website , had no problems"
Jeremy Reed,The process of requesting for withdrawal of automatic IRA rollover by previous employer was okay but following through paperwork is quite tedious & complicated for me. Speaking with the customer service agents on 2 occasions were great. Both were very courteous and helpful.
SHERISA WILLIAMS,"I would give 0 stars if I could. I started out with like a $6k investment, didn't know they had been slowly robbing me over time, ended up cashing out with 4k in just a couple years. NEVER again, bloodsucking crooks. Would've been completely depleted well before my retirement."
JEFFREY KOWALESKI,Automated assistance sucks!  Glad to be closing out account.
Alfonso Avalos,So many awkward and inadequate processes and communication failures over the past year. Immensely long wait times on the phone for more months that the pandemic justified. Lousy website. MT had poor communication with the holder of my metals and someone screwed up on a (test) distribution I made. Once I figured out things were not being handled well on either end I reluctantly decided to take a full distribution of the account which I would not have done but MT and the metals holder worked so poorly together. When I set the account up some years ago Millennium was the recommended custodian of HAA but they ended that relationship leaving me stuck with you.
Maxx,FANTASTIC Customer Service. They were able to assist me in locating my account information from about 9 years ago that I didnt know I had.  Really took the time to assist me.  Wonderful
EDUARDO MARTINEZ,"The agent I spoke with was very knowledgable, and helpful."
AXEL FRAYRE,"It is extremely difficult to get through to customer service. Every time I have been on hold for hours. They do not call back even though they promise to do so.I have been unable to access my account and my money for a long time and nobody is willing to help. They can find and acknowledge my account, however when I try to access it, I get the following error :""Access unavailable for this user.Invalid Request. Log Id:3865146Please contact InvestCloud directly during business hours.Please reference Id #3865146.""There is no way to contact InvestCloud.The only other option is to stand in protest at their entrance with a placard, asking for help."
Jana Otwell,My experience was very friendly fast and to the point thank you  keep it up  !!!!

TRACY YIRMIBIR,Millennium Trust has done a wonderful job. Thank you
JAMES BOHM,"Chantel(sp?) was awesome! I wasn’t expecting my account to be transferred here and was expecting a check instead. I have a big trip planned and needed the money ASAP. She stayed on the phone with me and made sure I was taken care. The “real time funds” system was fantastic and I had my money within 10 minutes of completing the form. When I open a new IRA, Millennium will definitely get my account. Thank you."
STEVE CHARTRAND,Excellent customer service
CARRIE CANADY,"She was helpful and kind and understanding of my concern, I could tell she felt bad for the delay in my withdrawal being processed."
MILES SIMMONS,"I was given inaccurate info by a representative over the phone regarding a disbursement from my 401K account.  Despite multiple emails in which I corrected the problems of my own accord, I still don't have my disbursement and the original request was made two weeks ago."
TB,The people I spoke to were helpful and nice. Greer made me feel confident that they really would get back to me (they are going to call me tomorrow). But the steps to actually speak to a representative were long and complicated. The phone menu kept sending me in circles.
WALTER L & C TYLICKI JTWROS,Very nice experience with the representative on the phone e to navigating the portal
KEITH MITCHELL,Thank you. Ms. Glenda was very professional and nice.  Assisted me throughout the proces my Millennium Account.

The lady who worked with me was very polite, courteous and professional. She tried to find what the problem was but in the end I had to email. She gave outstanding personable service. I truly appreciate that."

BRYNA ERWIN-MACEACHEN,Thank you ! Amazing team and prompt .
SHARON ROGERS,"The response to my request was quick, very quick. I had anticipated at least a month to receive my funds (I had this experience with another company). I was not clear however on whether taxes needed to be withheld or if a penalty for early withdraw (was it early?) would be set in place. Further clarity would have been beneficial."
JAMES HENRY,The web was fairly easy to follow. Funds came every fast.

This is my money which was with Capital One for over 25 yrs. and I didn’t want it to rollover to hem and I was a day late! What’s going on with this company?

Laura Bermea,Never had a problem just not with my previous employer and need the money to help with personal stuff and get myself back on the right track!
SHARON ELAM,The young man who helped me was very patient and thorough. He walked me through the process with which I needed help. It was a much less potentially stressful experience than I was aniticipating.
Samantha,Everyone I've spoken with has been friendly and helpful but in total it hasn't resolved the issue. I've been unimpressed by communications with the company overall.
MICHAEL ZANDER,"Fees, fees, and more fees.  I had to get away from this company.  When I left my job, they transferred the little bit of 401K money that I had into an account at Millennium Trust.  The constant fees were shrinking my balance so fast that I had to close my account.  The statements don't list any on-line access so I had to dig around to find it.  I would give them zero stars if I could."

R CARSON,EVERYONE AT MILLENNIUM HAS DONE A GREAT JOB IN WORKING WITH ME IN EVERY FASHION---FROM FORWARDING DOCUMENTS TO CHANGING PAYMENT METHOD. THEY ARE MORE THAN UNDERSTANDING MY DIFFICULTIES WITH COMPUTERS!
CRYs,"Terrible experience with Millennium Trust. They took over an account I had with a previous employer. No notice or warning. Then, when I went to transfer my funds to my current employer's fund, they made the process difficult. Finally, they charged significant fees during this process when I had never agreed to a relationship with Millennium Trust to begin with.DO NOT choose this firm to manage your funds."
SHAYE,VERY EASY TO DEAL WITH AND USER FRIENDLY
SHAY,"I had a very small 401k from a summer job. Since there are monthly fees to even have an account with Millennium Trust, it made more sense to just cash out my 401k. Then there was another fee to close the account."
JANICE DANFORTH,Very good and outstanding people to work with I am very satisfied with your customer service and keep up the good work
DAVID VEGA,I was laid off during covid. i used all of my 401k without penalty. when my company finally decided to let us go they stuck a chunk of my severance into the 401k. then after a year it was transferred to you. i did not want a small account to keep track and usually is alot of back and forth so i put it off.  when i contacted you to close it everything was very easy. i was surprised. the automation was helpful enough that i never had to ask for a person. it was handled on the first contact and arrived very quickly.
VERONICA ROYAL,I've been on the phone with you multiple times and my issue is yet to be resolved
KELSEY MCCARTHY,"Extremely frustrating. Online doesnt allow you to enter info. Gettong someone on the phone is like pulling teeth, and when you do they cant seem to answer questions while constantly talking over you. Im glad i was just rolling over from this company. Do not recommend."
David ,Sorry but I don’t write reviews for any one.
FRANCES KAMEL,All was going well until I was asked for the last 4 digits of a tax id number.  Not having a tax id number I had to make another call to speak to a rep only to find out what was needed was the last 4 digits of my ss number.  The rep couldn’t explain why it showed that on her end but not on my end.  Frustrating.
John Micetich,You're customer service was outstanding. Very courteous and listened to what I wanted to do. Thanks!

CHRISTOPHER WARD,Very helpful I would recommend to everyone
FRANK HERNANDEZ,"If find it ironic that Millinium Trust can easily take $35 dollars from my IRA each year without even speaking to me but it's like pulling teeth to process a transfer of MY funds to another established IRA at my bank. I spoke to an associate today that required me to process everything online even though I was actually speaking to him over the phone. This was inconvenient and ridiculous! You just don't want to let go of money that belongs to me. Millinium needs a better process for fund transfers. Now I have to pay a $30 fee to process this. Didn't I just do all the processing myself over the phone and online? Furthermore, I had to use a computer Instead of my phone despite the many text prompts providing 6 digital codes for identity protection. Why don't you just face time me and I could hold up my driver's license and have the safest process ever. You do realize computers get hacked as well right? What an ordeal. I hope I never have to deal with Millinium trust again!Proud to be ExcustomerAnita Cansler"
JUSTIN BRANCH,"what a circus of word salads.you verify everything along the way, but at the end there are 2 options for verification, neither of which a non-accountant can understand.you verified all the bank info, but then ask me to send you some sort of verification, by snail mail? what the heck?all I want is my money & I have jumped through more hoops than a circus pony.you obviously don't want anyone from the west coast, closing at 2:30pm.this has been a horrific experience. really awful experience.gut-wrenchingly horrible experience.have a nice day.Cal"

joseph hayes,"On hold for 40 plus minutes a couple times.  The voicemail says ""bad weather"" has been slowing down response time for a week.

JAMES KIKER,"My money was moved here by a previous employer I worked for which had closed. The only communication Millennium had with me was a mail out telling me my funds were moved to them and how much they received. They took quiet a chunk of my money considering they have done NOTHING to communicate with me regarding my funds or my investments. I’ve received less than $1 in over a year being with them. They take a chunk of fees annually, but I have less than $1 dividends so they, in essence will eventually take ALL of my money if I stay with them. My opinion is if they are going to receive people retirement money and take a chunk from it then they need to be more proactive at communicating to those people about they money and how they can help with investments; otherwise, they have not earned those large fees they are so happy taking!No message has been received and communion should have happened prior to my account sitting for so long while only receiving less than $0.30 monthly in dividends."
Thomas Edgar,"The process was seamless for me. I was very impressed with the tool, the steps were easy to follow and made sense.  Most of all it didn’t much time to complete."

Sarah Goddard,Very Satisfied
JAMES DISARIO,The company worked very promptly with my account.
JJ,Just wondering if an account is closed why don’t you inform the customer of your next actions especially with money involved. Did you process a check.. did you transfer.. did you do something.. because when you log in none of the links to transactions indicate anything.. imagine the customers surprise when what was is now zero with no information
ANNA WESTFAL,I requested assistance to access my account. it didn't work.
KIARA CONDE DE COBURN,It's been 3 weeks. The money no longer shows in my millennium account. It also is not in my bank account and to the best of my knowledge it is not in the mail either.

Matthew Cunningham,Person on phone was helpful and quickly resolved issue.
LINDA WOOLSEY,Good information was surprised by the amount.
KEVIN MEJIA ESCOBAR,"Don't trust the company. my 401k from my previous company was transferred to them. I've been trying to call them but you cannot talk personally to a customer support representative, all they have are recorded messages and directing you to their website which doesn't help since I need to talk to them directly and personally. This company is no good, It doesn't even deserve a one star rating. I would rate it a zero star if I could."
nyshelle whiting,Quick and painless they took all the hard work and guessing out out it and i got my funds promptly!
Maung Aye Min Htun,I just want to thank you so much for the quick process it was easy and I didn't have any questions
Elliott Pyron,The representative very patient and professional explain everything in detail. I would recommend to all my friends
DOROTHY MORROW,"The team members I spoke to were very professional, and helpful.  But you have problems that can be easily addressed to help make future customer communications more efficient.1. I waited 32 min for someone to pick up my call.  After another 2 minutes to identify myself, the agent explained that although I had called the right ""Individual"" account number, I was incorrectly routed.  It took another few minutes to get to the right team.  Fix this.2. Your IRA to IRA transfer form does not call out the inst@mtrustcompany email address anywhere.  Fix this.Thanks for the good service otherwise."
Bernie Smith,Great business
TALEA HARRIS,The website is very confusing to navigate.  The language is too technical-it needs to have a more user friendly language.
ROBERT MUNN,They steal your money! Stay away!!!
Sreeni,"It took me over 5 months to even get a look at how much money I had in the account, an account established without my knowledge when the company I had worked for got sold...and the MT staff, while nice and courteous, were unable to assist me due to system issues.  5 months.  To even find out how much money I had in the account, much less get access."

Anon,My transaction was simple and straightforward due to excellent and easy to follow guidance on the website.
JOHN DIXON,Great customer service. Rep that helped me knew all the answers to my questions.
Joseph Moreno,"It was a super fast and easy request. Called customer service. They emailed me the log in set up after verifying my info. Then I entered my request online and the next day my funds were in my account. I even have a fidelity investment banking account which typically delays wire transfers. I was very surprised after reading many negative reviews, that it went very well and fast."
Kathleen Johnson,I’m a new customer. I had a simple question. They answered in timely manner. All good.

Anonymous,"Even though I was to interact with Millennium once, and your assistant to me knew this, he went above and beyond to ensure that my request was submitted properly. I highly recommend Millennium."
art,She was kind of rude and seemed like she did not want to be on the phone with me at all. I did get the answers I was seeking but did not feel welcome.
zee,I was very pleased with MT. The way they process the distribution request was seamless and was very happy with the outcome I would recommend MT and will be happy to come back in the near future
Dan Narigon,Thank you for everything just waiting on debit card with my money.
Holly J. Huber,I was having trouble logging onto my account.  I decided to use the chat option and was very pleased with the chat agent --very knowledgeable and very professional.  I was instructed to call the company to update my contact number and was greeted by a very kind agent who was also patient with my lack in understanding of the portal and process of logging on.  The end result... I was able to log onto the portal and access the paperwork needed to file taxes.  Thank you...Thank you...Thank you for hiring and training such great representatives.

TIFFANNIE WELLS,Overcharging for a rollover and high fees

ROBERT SWITLIK,All agents I spoke to were accommodating and professional
Willie Lewis,Very helpful easy to deal with and supportive
CYNTHIA CARUSI,I had requested a distribution a couple days ago and had not even received an acknowledgement that they had received all my documents. I called today and the representative was rather short and curt. Basic business practice is to acknowledge that all materials had been received and give a timeline as to when to expect the distribution. Not good customer service.
IRS,I called previously and was informed that a good time to call was between 5 and 8pm in order to talk in person with a client service representative. I did so and was surprised to be transferred to a representative after giving my proper information.  The person I talked to revalidated my information and asked me how she could help.  I told her I had three questions about my RMD process.  She was able to pull up my transactions and my request and told me my answers. I asked another question and she told me she would put (calls or emails) out to someone who had more information.  She soon got a response and answered my question. I thanked her.  I wish also to thank those who helped her also. She was very kind and pleasant. Excellent.
WILLIAM ROGERS,Mrs. Alisha Washington was awesome
RONALD WADE,I had a rocky start with the company but they actually answered all my emails and were gracious in their correspondence. My problems were resolved and I have no complaints.
Cindy Morales,I handled everything I did online. I did however email Millennium trust to find out how long it would take to get my money. They said it could take up to 15 days. That was the only part that I really did not like. I’m like a long time to wait for a couple grand. Other than that my experience was good. Website was fairly easy to navigate.
NordVPN Customer,"Perfect web service. Quick, easy to Navigate. Absolutely no complaints."
CHRISTOPHER HERSHEY,I was helped promptly and efficiently.

LINDSAY HOESCHEN,The app was a great step by step process.
SHARON B,"My last 401K contribution from a previous employer went here. I had trouble transferring it to my primary account so I kept it in Millennium Trust for 7 years. Little did I know they pay themselves $40 a year to keep it open. With the dips in the market, and probably bad investments I did not have a choice in, I lost $600 plus paid $10 to close the account. What an unfortunate retirement method. I think I will get $23 after taxes. Hope they enjoy my money!"
CATHERINE A.,Something simple to do over the phone. Force to do it online and all you get Something is not valid.
Corey Mellenbruch,Millennium Trust was very fast and efficient and the website was east to maneuver.
ABEBU ABREN,I contacted customer service with questions about my account. The agent was very knowledgeable. I was directed to a website and the agent stayed on the phone with me and helped navigate the site page by page. I sincerely appreciate the quality of service Millennium Trust provided.
Myron Williams,Fast and easy customer service very nice and helpful
Paul Kaczmarek,"How do I give ZERO stars? Millennium is failing/neglecting to release my transfer, essentially holding my funds against my wishes FOR NO REASON, as if it is their money and not MINE. How is it that an institution is permitted to hold my funds indefinitely, without providing any reason??????Update: Millennium's reply to the above is NOT TRUE, and even contrary to what they told me over the phone. So now they are posting lies on top of it, just to try and save face."
GEORGE LOPEZ,Customer representative was responsive and knew how to handle my request.
Reba H,The respond was fas and very helpful I got the answer to my question very satisfy
Ulises Roque,Cheaper then the tax penalties on .y other two ira's
Katherine Durrigan,Really great job
Danikri,"Very professional, and helpful"
CHEYANNE CLOONAN,Millennium made me pay a percentage and my taxes up front when I gOt my 401k EARLY because I had to and they turned around and reported to the IRS that it was not taxed. That is Fraud!!!
MIRIAM KELLY,"The repeated profession that they value your time is a total misrepresentation. The fact that their automated systems repeat this claim over and over again as you punch through to reach a true human being to request information that only that person has access to is proof that this company does not value your time at all. Too bad that companies such as this do not realize that automation is not the solution to all of their manpower needs. Once I did reach a human, I was able to pose my questions and obtained satisfactory answers. The person on the other end of the line was polite, responsive to my questions and was quick to find the answers to the questions I posed."
DURALL BEATTY,No complaints ! Great company thus far
ASHLEY MCCARTER,"I needed some help with creating my account. So I called. This rating is for the 2nd person I spoke with. She was kind enough to stay on the phone and guide me through some steps in order for me to finish. Which I am thankful for. But she did start to get a bit impatient. Hurrying me. I’m slow when it come’s to doing thing’s like this. I’m just glad it’s done, sort of. I tried to pull up my account putting in my correct email info. I entered the password and it wasn’t right. I kept trying to reset it but I never got an email back. So I have to call again. Ugh!"
HERMON MCDONALD,The representative was professional and friendly. The process was just how she expected.

Nick Leister,"Tried to talk to rep via the phone, after they harvested all of my personal info, they would not verify if I even had an account. I believe their phone bank could be a phishing entity for identity theft."
Robert Heidemann,Very easy to sign up for online account. And very easy to fill out the distribution form.
LIEZL FULLER,Associate was very courteous and knowledgeable.  Webpage was easy to use.
TODD,"***update, as stated in the response i was credited back funds to cover both fees and a bit for my frustration. I got a very different experience with the manager that Valle d me than with the rep i got calling in.   If you are comfortable watching and managing your own funds they may be a good fit for you. My retirement was forced into this company when my past employer filed ch 11.   They ignored my finds for years and then when i went to move them into another actual retirement fund forced me to open an online account at a charge of 30.00. Tuen they charged me (all in one transaction)  25.00 to cpose that account.    They held it as cash and charged high fees for not growing my money.   Do not use this company.  I will update this review if they do the right thing."

ALVIZA MACHISE,Job was done on time

Fernando Andrade,Representative was very professional. Definitely felt valued as a customer. Representative made sure reason for call was resolved
BRENDA HARRISON,Monique was very helpful and sounded happy to talk to me.  That means so much at 7am in the morning when I haven't had any coffee.  I would be very happy coming back to Millennium based on the experience I had working with her for 5 minutes... it meant a ton to me.

Millennium Trust as a organization processed request properly and even in the short waiting point; there was access to updates of the transaction all 24/7.They deserve ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"

Donna E.,Fast and easy response!
MICHELLE HAYES,For the most part on line forms were easy to follow
Sofia Frankel,"I appreciate Millennium Trust for going above and beyond to locate me and inform me of an existing account. I believed I had rolled over the IRA with which the account was associated in 2018 with another financial firm, and became concerned when after all these years I find out that one account still existed! The website was very user friendly and the turnaround on my request for distribution was unbelievable. While I do not have a need for services at this time I will definitely keep MT in mind and would recommend them!"

WANDA WALKER Hodges,Very helpful and answered all questions that I had about ira and what it's good for and how m
JOSEPHINE WILLIAMS,"I had received a letter from this company telling me it has the money form a company I worked at. When I wanted to TIAA to have control and move if from this company to TIAA, it was noted it was in a 403(b)-plan due to it was a university. However, no one from MT noted that MT changed the account I have in the 403(b) to a Traditional IRA and took $35 for a fee. TIAA sent me 3 letters telling me MT would not transfer the money. When I called MT, they said that TIAA was seeking a 403(b)plan and it is now a Traditional IRA and I asked who decided this and why has no one contacted of this. It finally got cleared up, but very disappointed with the LACK of communication where TIAA would not be able to get the account since I had to claim the account. Again, no one told me I had to claim my money. Assine the entire process and lacks professionalism the company and its processes. On 3/16/2022, Myra called me and now tells me, there is MORE confusion, how can this be Myra? You are the one who explained me to have TIAA change the verbiage of 403(B) to Traditional IRA in the transfer form which we did. The paperwork should be coming to MT next week so the Traditional IRA can be moved finally to TIAA.  Apparently, the 403(B) money was dropped into MT in December 2021 by the University, and I am hearing about this now?"
JJ,Person on phone was nice but I was not able to complete the task. Website is confusing. Don't recommend.
Richard Johnson,"Automated Customer Service.I am not pleased with the automated customer service available on the telephone. When I want to speak with someone, I want to speak with someone to answer my questions, not listen to a recording telling me to go online. Very disappointing."
Tanisha Sumler,Fast results. Friendly and helpful. Offered answers to questions I didn’t know to ask.
LATANIA M,I had a great experience with Millennium Trust. I made a request online for a payout. It was extremely easy and the money was in my account in 2 days. I am very happy and would recommend them to family and friends.
ivan espinoza,"malissa, i think that was her name.  was a pleasant and helpful person."

A. A.,"Extremely long on hold time, and disconnected half way through, but They called me back immediately. Customer service representative made my day helping me through everything and all my questions."
SARAH LUKONIS,The first guy I spoke with was rude and not helpful. But when I called back I spoke with a lady. She was friendly very helpful and took her time and explained things. She was everything nice. That guy needs a lesson in customer service. He cut me off when I was speaking I hope you all pull the call and hear him for your self. But the lady made up for his bad behavior with her kindness.
LAMONT WHITE,"The person I spoke to in regards to the account transfer seems like he doesn't have enough knowledge,"
Cassy Knudson,"Initial agent I spoke to was rude and highly unprofessional. She interrupted and cut me off multiple times and would assert her comment without hearing or allowing me to speak. The most unpleasant conversation I’ve had. The initial rep should not be in customer service and she needs more training on how to have a basic conversation with a customer to in depth training about tax forms. She gave us inaccurate and incorrect information. She transferred me to a supervisor eventually. The supervisor (Joanna) was gracious, kind and understood the situation at hand. Promptly resolved the issue."
PIERRE GALARZA,"Cashed in an IRA. Easy money, they put it in my bank account instantly."
Eulalia Batista,Robyn was very nice and helpful with my inquiry
Joe,The customer service rep I had sounded tired and irritated with my questions. It’s like I had to try really hard to get information out of him. Normally I don’t take these types of surveys but just thought I should say something. Possible he was just having a bad day.
ELIZABETH,My questions was not answeredWaiting for replyJanet was good but could not help me.Been waiting for weeks to fix the problem

Vicky Yeung,The user interface is the worst i have used of all financial sites. They have basically no customer service and tons of hidden fees. Do yourself a favor and take your money elsewhere.
Tammie Gardner,I am very frustrated that with this day and age a more established online platform is not accessible. Online transactions are more and more common and I feel that MTC needs to catch up!

Michael Dunn,Thanks for your customer service

Vic W,I NEED TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE GIVE ME THAT OPTION INSTEAD OF GIVING ME A VIRTUAL ASSISTANT EVERY TIME I CALL. I NEED HELP!
Terry Merkle,Super easy and user friendly to use. Will definitely use the company again in the future.

customer,I have 2 accounts but can only access one of them.
Casey Russell,Excellent service agentLooking to deposit checks from 2 different sources into a new Millennium account and then to convert one as a back door IRA and another amount as a taxable Roth conversion.  I needed to talk this through and understand what forms are required and what order to transmit things.  I found the agent to understand my goals and to have given me helpful suggestions on how to move forward and the agent kindly emailed to me the forms and links that will enable me to get this all completed.  Very excellent service.
Krystal Rushing,Took 3 days to get a statement! Not helpful and the process is overly complicated. 100% would not recommend  I am only dealing with then to move money a previous employer moved to them. Avoid at all costs
ALLEN BLONDIN,Your company uses people money as an interest free fund. Your company does not provide any service (No one from Millennium Trust ever called me or get in touch with me through mail or email).
JEFFREY,They charge more in fees than I make interest.  I am trying to contact them via phone to transfer my IRA to a bank with no fees. Twenty minutes later...no answer. Unacceptable
JACOB DE SERSA,Awesome 😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉
AIMEE MOORMAN,I have an account that was rolled over to Millennium. I want to warn everyone that if you need to call them about anything they put you on hold and forget about you. I've been trying to complete a transaction they said I need to voice verify but have been on hold over the last 3 days for over 6 hours. This company is a joke.
JOHNELL WELLS,I was impressed that the agent that I spoke with scheduled a follow-up call for the next day and kept that appointment. That meant that I did not have to call the general customer service number and then go through all of that waiting. As a result my concern was easily and quickly resolved.
Andre Holliday,My problem is not so much with the company as the customer service. This is an account which I had totally forgotten about until I received an email about it. I had forgotten my password and requested a reset. Response was that I would receive an email with a link to do so. Never received it. Resorted to calling them on several occasions and was on hold for 45 minutes to no avail. This has happened over the course of about a week and a half with no resolve
Kerry Strittmater,Great. Got everything done that I needed very fast and everything laid out to where I could understand easily. A+
VIJAY KALARIA,"Easy, fast process."

CLAUDIA CORRALES,"The agent I spoke with was very helpful, professional and pleasant to speak with as she stayed on the line with me while I navigated your awful and confusing website to get what I needed to have done."
STEVEN ROSARIO,I called to advise that I can't access my account online because the email address for my account no longer exists and that I wanted to close out my account.  I gave the rep my new email address and she said she would email the authorization form for the withdrawal to me.  I never received it and my email address was not updated on my account so I still can't access my account online.
Brookfielder,The phone representative had a bad attitude and didn’t want to answer any questions. I will find a different company and move my money over.
EMILY CURRIER,Pauline was very professional and extremely helpful. She was knowledgeable and amazingly articulate.
MICHELLE BOURIE,Every rep I spoke with made it easy and was extremely helpful
WASHINGTON,It took a lot to get customer service once I got through customer service they pretty much gave me the rundown and help me out with pretty much all the paperwork they needed to get done they were very excellent and fast
FRANK,The process of transfer is manual and required me to call in to know the status of my transfer out request. I am stunned that you guys take 15 business days to process a transfer out request. Equally stunning is that this is a manual process. I am extremely unhappy with Millennium Trust company.
JOSEPH HOOPER,Very understanding and helpful when I have a misunderstanding good group of people here.
Ed N,"Delores, was very friendly and patient with me and helped me to find my information and assisted me to get my info processed and also sent an email spelling out everything."

THOMAS BURKE,"To Whom It May Concern,I had a very disappointing experience working with Millennium Trust. I asked for a roll over of my retirement money to be done between Millennium Trust and another institution, in order to avoid handling a check with a large value. I was told that it is possible to do so. I followed their instructions and filled a out paper request and notarized signatures. It was time and energy consuming. Millennium Trust did not acknowledge receiving my paperwork. When I called to follow up, I realized that they had everything but just failed to mail the check. In the end, instead of mailing the check to the other institution they mailed it to my house, doing the exact thing I tried to avoid. I wasted almost 3 months and the result is profoundly unsatisfactory. I had one of the worst experiences working with Millennium Trust. In my opinion, they are unprofessional, to say the least."
CHRISTOPHER LEWIS,"Excessive fees. I originally tried to access this account months ago. Ran into a very unfriendly customer service agent. I now understand why this company, Millennium Trust, has so many negative reviews online."
Jonathan Smith,Very good experience with the agent
MELISSA EAGLE,"vicki, who helped me, was incredibly patient and helpful.  I was rattled because I had forgotten to claim my RMD for 2021, and she helped me get registered and even emailed me the forms to get this done ASAP.  thanks, Vicki!"
Stacy Hill,"I tried closing this account after millennium trust applied all my funds to account fees. I was able to recover a very small amount of my money and thought I was done with this company. Unfortunately, somehow my account was not closed and somehow they found a way to continue charging me account fees. I wish the company I worked for never invested my money into this account."
CALVIN LETTRIES,Took care of my needs quickly and confidently
KPUWULU SUMO,This firm f%*king sucks. My employer's IRA plan was through them and it's an awful experience. So many fees and they do not let you choose your investment fund. Once I quit they failed to notify me they started charging me additional account fees and they were so hefty I wound up losing 45% of my account contribution value and cashed out the IRA early with the IRS penalty to avoid them. F*#k Millenium. The reviews here speak for themselves. NEVER trust these b*stards with your money. They will take every penny. Use Vanguard or Charles Schwab instead!Update:I have been contacted about having these fees refunded. If this is the case in the next few business days I will be updating this review as that would be a major step in the right direction and a positive outcome to this experience.
TAMARA MAIDEN,This was a very easy process to complete.
Eric Wilson,Great and very simple to get things done online.
MARK MIGUEL,Horrible experience my money was put into a ira from my previous employer and I was never contacted. Until 13 plus years later after they took all my money and I had nothing left.
Tamara McEwan,Website very easy to navigate. Was able to finish my forms very quickly!
LY,"Marlene was extremely helpful in answering my questions, directing me to the website locations and addressing issues regarding taxes and penalties."
BRENT KELLEY,Very good communication with customer service representative and was very knowledgeable thank you so much for the assistance
MARIA BAEZ,Get your retirement rolled over to another company as soon as possible! For over a month I have received a message when trying to sign in that I need to secure my account by confirming my phone number. When I ask to receive the code the only two ways available an error message pops up stating that the action cannot be completed by millennium trusts website… really professional. Customer service is very unfriendly even when you are an understanding person and treat them with the utmost respect. I hope I can finally rollover my account soon.
Geraldine Parsons,Just fees fees fees and sucked my account dry. What a scam.
MILLICENT JAMES,"I had issues with using the site from my phone. Once I made a call, the CSR was super helpful and sent a quick email link to help complete my process. She was pleasant to speak to and easy to work with. Highly recommend this company to any one in the future."
ANDREA HIRTE,1 hour call wait then all the guy could do was ask me if my internet was working when his web page would not load on Chrome Firefox or edge I simply asked if he could fax a statement to a real Ira company and after 15 minutes of demanding something other than his broke website he only agreed to email a pdf to me which did not have all the info I needed on it
PATRICIA FLANDERS,They help me right away .. No games or run around.
Kristie Patzius,"I was having trouble getting started. The company that I had worked for had given a wrong date of birth. Now, I did not know that so I was trying to login as a new user and it kept giving me a 'wrong information' error. I looked for a number to call. Called that number and I got no where. I did the online chat..none of the options helped me. I became very frustrated and closed the chat. That was back in January. I really needed to get this taken care of so I tried again, in March. Again, the number was of no use. I sent an email. I then tried the online chat. Went thru all the options, again none were helping me. Finally, I typed in help and FINALLY..i was ""chatting"" with a person. Her name was Terri. Thank goodness for Terri. She was able to find the problem and she sent me a link to correct the problem. I gave a low rating because it took me h.o.u.r.s! to just find a way to contact a live person. I feel like adding ""chat with an agent"" should be an options on both the chat and phone.As for Terri, she is definitely a five star employee. She was wonderful!"
JIANHE ZHANG,The young man that helped me had excellent customer service. Very knowledgeable
ROBIN KAYNOR,Some extra money got sent to the company thru a 401k. Millenium contacted me and was very accommodating to setting up my password and delivered my payment at my age of 59.5 very easily.  I have been considering sending my entire investment to them. It was so simple. Thanks
Laura Miller,"I was expecting to have to do a paperwork circus act jumping through seemingly endless hoops. Instead the young lady I talked to was very helpful with guiding through the steps needed, the process itself was just answering various questions and was also quick and straight forward."
DIANA,Millennium trust is the best way to keep your money safe
Nicole,Great experience working with Millennium. Will gladly do it again in the future!
Marian Futrell,I needed to cash in an account and Millenium Trust was very speedy and made it very easy to transfer it to my bank.  Very trustworthy organization.
WILLIAM VELA,"CAlled in to rollover my account to my new employer, the lady was patient and helpful at the moment of assisting me in submit this process."
Edward,"Great customer service, helpful, and minimal wait time."
Martha Corral,I want to return to Millennium I didn't realize I was closing my account but after getting my new position I will return on my own accord and I am glad this platform exists.
BRENDA,It was simple and easy to get my request to send me my IRA money. Just a wonderful experience with this company.  It was an unexpected and so easy to communicate and just an awesome experience
Cheryl,It was very easy and fast to fill out the distribution paper work.
MICHAEL MASON,The gentleman on the phone guided me through what I needed to do. It was very helpful
Aren Woytek,"The process was self explanatory and very easy, so there was no need to speak to anyone."
ROGER LERRICK,"Fast and efficient, easy to use online!!!"
THERESA WILLIAMS,After not knowing I had an account for a year I was charged a couple of fees. I called a few times and finally got one fee refunded and was able to take the money out of my account.
SIARRA KEHLENBECK,"It took me 4 days to get a hold of your company which is pretty terrifying seeing how you guys have my funds. I also finally got a call back after 2 emails and like 6 calls and felt rushed and didn't feel like anything I expressed was heard and the responses were not explained well to me. I was told if I had questions to call but it took me so long to get a response that calling is insane. So, I was told I could email but that I would not get any information regarding my account specofically despite what information I could provide over email. It's just ridiculous I have never been more frustrated trying to get through to a company."
Robert  Porter,"SIMPLE,QUICK & EASY!! DEPOSIT IN MY ACCOUNT DIDNT EVEN TAKE A FULL 24 HOURS!! Thank you again"
Samantha Jacobs,Easiest and friendliest customer service ever.  I enjoyed my time and she made me smile and laugh.  Amazing.

Sarah Hohwald,The rep was super helpful and walked me through the steps to get to my account online. It was fast and a simple process.  Thank you!
BRAD DIXON,They keep everything easy and straight forward.
unhappy customer,My account was transferred from a tiaa account where it was making money to millennium.  It was not making any money and was subject to high fees. I was not very happy with losing so much money.  It also took 2 tries for my financial advisor and I to get it transferred out.
Omega De Ville Prestige Co,"One of the things that is extremely difficult about working with Millennium Trust is that everything sounds like a scam--from the letters you get in the mail to the people who call your phone asking for you personal information.  They also make it a very big hassle just to create an account online.   When I get calls from people there, I'm asked for my name, birthdate, address, last four of my SSN just to confirm my identity.  But I have no way to confirm that I'm actually getting a call from Millennium Trust.  I attempted a few times to tell them I don't share that information when somebody calls me and told them I would call back using a number on the Millennium Trust website. This just ended with me getting stuck in an endless loop of a phone system that doesn't want to actually get me in touch with somebody; it just repeats over and over again that I need to make an account online.  Which I can't do without providing an unreasonable amount of personal information to someone over the phone apparently.At one point after having to verify all that  information with someone who had called my phone, I was asked to email the company a copy of my driver's license.  I've been trying to make an online account with them for a while now and figure it's my only option.  But this definitely felt like it might be a scam.  And is not a great way for me or the company to protect my personal information.I think if Millennium Trust allowed you to create an account on their website before linking you to the account with the money, it would solve some of this problem.  That way documents could be uploaded to the website on your account, you definitely wouldn't need to email anyone a copy of your driver's license, forms could be approved or not approved through the account, and nobody from the company would need to call you."
Alexander Little,I worked with Bruce in client services.  I was not sure what I needed to do.  I explained to Bruce what I wanted to do with my account.  He walked me through the necessary steps.  It made the process so simple.  I really appreciated his help.  Thank you.
Tamika McLean,Very helpful and easy to talk people thank you
Mrs Nurse,Thank you for serving me. It has truly been a blessing. Your service put food on my table that I otherwise would not have had. Thank you again.
disappointed,Excellent Customer Service !Thank you Robin !!
ANTONIO,"I had a 401K from work and forgot about it when I left my employment, months later I received a notice that my account was transferred to Millenium, I called and I agreed for them to manage it. They managed it in good interest."
Robert Kuehnl,Called to get a statement sent to me either by email or mail. Was told I needed to get take contro of my account was went instruction to get control of my account.  Followed the instructions.
Idzmo,Our agent was very helpful! Thank You…
Tamara Perez,Ease of transaction and a quick transfer. Really smooth. An excellent experience.
Dane Riggenbach,Got card can't activate it ! Phone numbers provided are bogus as well as the websites and apps! Total scam!!!!
Janet Oates,"I had a little bit of a run around with the information needed, but once it was all figured out it was great."
JULIA HATHAWAY,Not apart of ACATS so it takes forever to transfer out.
Matt,Never will I recommend this company to a person. They will take your money in seconds then make you wait weeks to maybe get it back and if your in  emergency they will stall and delay and make you feel air and not give a thought about you. They’ll let you go homeless and loose you car while saying it takes 15 businesses days to get you your money back even tho you bank with a company that it a partner company. Horse poop company and will never put a penny into it company again!!!!
April Bunn,Representative was very helpful in helping me with my distribution and explained the entire process.
Teneka Garrett,The agent who helped me was concise in her explanation of the steps I needed to take in order to close out my account.
Wes G. ,For some reason could not access our account. Staff was very helpful for quickly got us back in.Thank you
TYLER WALK,Very good service! I'm so happy about Millennium! I'm looking forward to continuing an good relationship and also re investing!
SARA WIDMAN,I asked for information regarding account transfer and my questions were answered along with email instructions.
PS,I needed to close my account and originally wanted to transfer the balance to my existing IRA. I found it was very difficult to do that. In the end I opted to have the balance distribution sent directly to me to avoid the hassle and paperwork. I did not find the website user friendly.
LYNN REALE,"In a simple statement ,your staff did awesome. And thank you all."
Archer,"the customer service is terrible, I have an account and I was talking so that they would not charge me for the maintenance of the account and even if I filled out the form they always charged me for the maintenance of the papers, I called customer service and they told me you do not have a user account and I always had one and then they tell me the system changed and they never told me anything?  and they always charged the maintenance bad company I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT"
MARIA LLERENAS,Easy to navigate and find what you're looking for.  Good information available.
Diamond Ridgway,"My account came to Millennium Trust because my former employer changed companies. I contacted Millennium with the intent to roll it over to an existing alternative. However, after speaking with the representative, we decided to keep the account with Millennium. All questions were answered. Clarification was provided when needed. I wish I could remember the name of the rep I spoke with. He represented your company very well. Thank you!"
Timothy Vayhinger,"Customer service representatives are extremely knowledgeable and helpful. I had a tech issue that blocked me from accessing my account. Oftentimes, I find that customer service agents are not well versed in the tech their company uses. I worked with two customer service agents who fully understood my problem and then solved it quickly and easily. It may take a long time to reach customer service (I was waiting for close to 30 minutes), but it is well worth the wait to have my issue resolved."
DAVID WONG,"Working with their online agent was a nightmare. The agent was not accurately reading what I was writing, was intrusive on my rights as a client,  and gave me incorrect information. I will be transferring my assets out of millennium trust ASAP due to this interaction.Also in response to the below response from MTrust. This response perfectly illustrates how you do not listen. Why would you call my cell phone when I made it explicitly clear to your agent (in a well documented conversation) that my phone is NOT WORKING and I cannot use it. Thus why would you contact me via the phone and then recommend me to call you. It's absolutely amazing the incompetence level"
Amber Anderson,Excellent customer service. The process was fast and easy!
Whit W,Super smooth bank transfer and also quite fast. Not a single hiccup.
Lindsey Garrison,I don't remember what it was but it was hard to figure out the password you had it listed as something else
VICTORIA WHITE,I just want say that I'm extremely thankful to the customer service I recieved today.  The person assisting me knew exactly what they were doing and saying from A-Z no question. Thanks Myra
Timothy Jackson,The rep that did the callback was great. The phone system is average. The website is a nightmare to navigate.
Samuel Anthony,Website was easy to use and was helpful in closing out my account since I no longer work for the company who set up the IRA account
JAVIER GUZMAN,"Extremely nice , very patient with my request."
FATIMA REDD,This is good company al you people thank you for you service
More Than Satisfied,"Customer service is excellent when I call and talk to them. Either they are extremely busy or need to hire more people, they require 3 to 4 days to review subscription document for investment."
CONNOR SPROULL,"You can never get ahold of anyone, and emails are never returned."
Elizaveta Karpova,"The automated system is horrible.   Then once I finally was able to talk to a real person, they didn't understand anything and were very unknowledgeable about any questions I had or what I wanted to do with my accounts."
Ellen MoskowitzGross,"I had a traditional IRA account with Millennium Trust that I wanted to close. The client service specialist I spoke with described in detail the steps I must take in order to accomplish this. Because her instructions were clear and concise, I was able to take the first steps in the process of closing this account. The expertise of this client service specialist is the reason for the 5 stars rating."
ROY VICKERY,After many false starts I ended up talking with a real human being. Usinia was very helpful and spent the time required to get me back on track.
LINDA CHAFFEE,Took over a week to get my money. Other companies I can get money within an hour.
NAOMI MURPHY,Easy to make an inquiry about withdrawing from my IRA and I received my money VERY fast via direct deposit. Thank you
PAULA SHELTON,Great help from all the people I spoke to.. I just wish there was a minimum amount for dispersal check where we didn't have to lose more in a closing fee.
MARIA SMITH,FROM THE VERY FIRST PHONE CALL EVERYTHING WAS A 10 FROM THERE ON OUT. KAMILA GETS A 10 FROM ME. SHE KNEW EVERYTHING. GIVE HER A RAISE.DANNY GRAY
Ana Mendoza Sanchez,Took a while to connect with a person but worth the wait.  She was very patient (me being a non-industry person) and helpful!  I always appreciate talking with a person.  Automated calls are annoying and most of the time not very helpful as everyone has extenuating issues an automated system can't help with........and it wastes time!  That's why I recently switched banks!
FELICIANO TAPIA,"Employer told me a check would be sent to me after I left their employment.  In reality the amount was rolled over to Millennium Trust without my knowledge and/or permission.  I have other investment and IRA accounts with other brokerage firms and I don't need another..  As I was required to create an account, I did so, and when I requested a full distribution so I can roll it over, I was charged a $25 ""account close"" fee for all of one day."
Gina Marino,"Like everywhere, not much human help only bots."
Nathaniel Herrera,Personable nice
JULIAN MORAN,"I keep getting calls to call about my account. I call the number provided and am unable to speak with anyone no matter what I do. I keep being told by the virtual assistant that in order to speak with someone, I have to call within certain hours when call volume is less. I have tried numbers times in varying days to call during these specified times and still get this same message. How are other people getting through in order to create high call volumes. I am unable to use any prompts with the assistant because I don’t know what the call is regarding. Time to fire the “virtual assistant” and hire a real person."
NATHIR TADROS,"Easy to use, easy to understand."
Phill,Customer representative was knowledgeable and kind. I was able to get my questions answered.
CAROL WITTER,Millennium Trust has a very good and secure site.  I found it extremely frustrating at first to provide my personal information. I may have been missing part of the information each time I tried. The system continued to respond to me by email to let me know that they see me trying to provide information and to try back later to complete information.  This type of security made me feel very secure about doing business with this company and will continue with my investments.
ANDREW MITCHELL,I Was trying to fill out the transfer forms and got so far and then it wouldn't let me go any further. The investment adviser that I am rolling this over wants a  statement emailed to me so he can do the rollover.  That is what I am trying to accomplish.  CAN YOU EMAIL A COPY OF ALL 3 ACCOUNTS?  I need this to complete the transfer.Thanks.  If you need to call:   1-608-298-8164.
RICHARD,"great service, fast and easy web site. recommended"
JOSEPH DEMARCO,Fast and thorough! Had a 401k transferred to them from my ex employer and after the dust settled I really needed that money and getting it was simple and convenient. Awesome job

Guadalupe Peralta,My account was automatically rolled over from my previous employer. I decided not to keep my account in general and millennium trust helped me close my account in a matter of minutes.
FANNY HEFTY,Good company. Fast results.
Cheryl,"The Agent with whom I spoke with Today was indeed professional, knowledgeable and  precise on the subject matter as well very patient in assisting me. I am grateful for individuals such as herself, also best wishes!"
OMER HIGGINBOTHAM,Overall I had a great first experience with Millenium Trust. Withdrawing funds can be a challenging and daunting process but their online system made it smooth and simple. Creating and accessing my account was done securely and with ease. All the information they provided was clear/concise. I'd recommend this company.
TURNER,Very useful and very easy to use. If given the opportunity I would work with them again.
Chris Postelnick,The person who answered the phone was able to get my account to unlock. I'm now able to access my account as I want.
MARY PAMPLONA,"We spoke with Bruce regarding my  401K - but we are now living in the UK and needed to speak to someone directly about how to transfer these funds to the UK. Bruce was brilliant, really helpful, understood our problem and worked with us to resolve the issue and remain totally in compliance with both US and UK regulations. Thank you Bruce, cannot recommend anyone better!"

Tarrah Davis,"The person on phone I think Keisha from Pittsburgh was cordial, helpful and humble! Great service"
KRISTA LILLY,"There seems to be a bit of a problem with the phone system. I was disconnected twice while waiting for an agent. Both calls went beyond 20-minutes wait time before I was disconnected.  Most of what I did, however was through email. That worked out great. From the moment of my request for partial distribution until the time it hit my bank was just a couple of days. I was impressed. Thank you Robin R"
CHANEL PERRY,Very easy to use
ARLINE NIVENS,"Associate was very polite,knowledgeable and helpful.  Thank you Dolores for providing great customer service."
Pedro P,My account was transferred to you without my knowledge. And then to find out that there was a $30 annual fee that I had to pay without even knowing. That ended up being almost 10% of my balance that I left my account with you I would have just lost more money

Patti Severiano,I closed a 401k from a previous employer. I called to ask for information on how to close it and the woman who answered walked me through how to answer the questions. They also had a video you can view beforehand so you can prepare for what questions you need to answer. They were very friendly and respectful.
STEVEN JOHNSON,My former company rolled my account over to you without my permission. I sent paperwork directing them to roll over to another company. So I have been charged an annual fee of $30.00 without my knowledge or permission. I will also be charged $25.00 to close out the account when the correct company activates the transfer which will close out my account. This is a horrible practice. I will not ever recommend this company after my business transaction is completed.
DOMINO RODRIGUEZ,This company is so easy to work with. I was able to distribute my old 401k to myself within 2-4 business days. I’ve never seen another company like Millennium! Glad I could experience a simple company in such a complicated world. Thank you M Trust!

Lance Braun,Very easy to use web site. Direct deposit very helpful
Suzi_O,"Recently learned through mail that my retirement savings through previous employer was transferred to millennium. All my questions and moves I wanted to make were answered and executed without having to talk to anyone. The site is easy to navigate and they provide tutorials if needed. I will definitely use their services in the future! If I can’t reach a live agent, then I should be able to handle business without one and that’s exactly what happened. Highly recommend!"
CHOSANA LYONS,"The transaction I signed in to make went smoothly and quickly. I had to do some consolidating, which I didn't expect to be done so easily. There were easily laid out steps, and no need for a follow up action."
DEENA MURRAY,My previous job transferred my funds to Millennium but I needed it for private reasons. I called and spoke to a representative who was very helpful and informed me on how I can get my money. I went online and filled out the form and within 2 days the funds were in my account. Thank you all for being so helpful and I will be back in the future to see what you all can do with my money because from this experience I can see great things in the future!

BHAVNA SHARMA,flawless in everything!
James Chen,The website was easy to use. The company is reputable and my transactions were handled accurately and efficiently. Thanks
SALLY BORGERDING,"The automated phone system was incredibly frustrating. The automated system could not accomplish the tasks that I needed done, but would not let me speak to a representative. It told me to call back between 5-8pm central time, when I was calling at 6:30 pm central time. Incredibly frustrating. I only got through to a representative after the system failed to understand my birthdate on the 3rd attempt. Ridiculous."
BILLY JOHNSON,Website is easy and any process is super efficient.  Thank you.
RAMON GONZAGA,You have my money. Just sitting in an account.  Not making money.  Butt YOU CHARGE a fee.
Lenore Smith,"It has been a hassle trying to get access to my accounts and get them linked. The customer service reps I spoke to were extremely helpful. The system they use in not user friendly. I still have not received the email from this company stating that I can log into my account. I has to fill out everything manually which I don't mind but they had all my private information, account balances and I couldn't even get in. Ridiculous."
KATRINA RYNIER,Haven't gotten the invite to get access to my money!! My new phone number is 5053182957. Can you please update it for me. Thanks
LENORA WELLS,"Outrageous and hidden fees make leaving money with this company foolish.  Their website is very hard to navigate, requires many needless (but required) steps to login and is misleading.  The phone lines have crazy long wait times with long and redundant phone trees.  All of it seems designed to make getting access to your account extra hard.  Any funds left with them dwindle away due to the fees.  Even getting it transferred out costs fees.  The fees are so out of control, it feels unethical.   I am angry at my employer for doing business with this company as I lost about 2.5% of my money in fees as soon as it was deposited here."
AUSTIN M.,Nice quick an easy enough transaction thanks
TYLER,The agent was very friendly and professional. This rating doesn't reflect or should not reflect on her performance. She did fantastic.  I had issues waiting for over 90 minutes to talk to an agent.
Rosanne Esse,Good easy safe
CYRUS HALL,Staff was professional and patient with me as I asked many questions.  They walked me through the process of filling out an RMD form for the first time.

Rey,"I found the service I received to be exceptional, very helpful, and very courteous."
EDWARD HOLLAND,I just heard of your company and not sure what to think about it
JOSEPH CAMPBELL,"LOVED MY ONLINE EXPERIENCE!!! I found out that I had money in an IRA account with Millennium. After reading through the paperwork, I called the customer service number, but they were close. I proceeded to access this account, which I have never used before, online. They asked for an account number, which I did not have. Then they asked me to verify other info to make sure it was me. I did and Voila...I was in. I selected the options to withdraw my money and in less than 5mins, I was done. Received confirmation that my request had gone through & that my money would be electronically deposited into my bank account. NO HASSLE!!! Their process was easier than using my credit union. THANK YOU FOR HAVING A SEAMLESS PROCESS!!!"
Sylvia,Wonderful company to be a part of.
NOEL LANE,Helped with my problem great customer service
JOSEPH GONZALEZ MARTINEZ,"I like the options, speed and efficiency"
cdzdenek,"My employer moved my 401-K to M-Trust. I tried calling them when I received the notification of the transfer and received a recording stating high call volumes, call back later (after 6PM). The office hours on the mail I received stated they closed at 6PM. Took me 3 days to get a rep and I was on hold 20 minutes."

YUNG LONG LEE,Needed the money so I had to part ways.No other issues just personal necessities.
ELSA VALIENTE,I was pretty mad. You know it's my money and I want it now. So that's how I reacted to the lady that answered the phone. She quickly assess the situation. Inform me of the information I needed. Calmed me down. Explain everything was for my own safety. And then help me with how to solve the problem. Obviously above and beyond. I wish everybody I talk to me on the phone could be that good.  Give her a raise now !!!
JIMMIE HAYNES,I'm happy finally I can get to my account thank you !!!
Anna Charles,"I called to ask a couple of basic questions. The phone was answered quickly by a pleasant gentleman. He offered to transfer me to the Trades Department but I was not ready for that yet. When I am ready I will definitely call back. He could not answer any questions about rules of Minimum Required Distributions, but suggested that I could ask a banker."
Nelson Sadien,The representative was very helpful and the transactions were done expeditiously.
Keisha Brown,"Cashed out a small IRA, that had just sat around for about 16 years and didn't go anywhere.  I cashed it out and they helped me all the way.  Was not hard getting my funds."
Anne Weaver Clark,"I contacted Millenium Trust to close out a 401K account that my previous employer rolled over to them without my knowledge.  Millenium was very helpful when I had difficulty registering on their website. I was able to close out my account and have my funds direct deposited, they say within 1-2 business days.  We shall see..."

customer,Reply was timely. Information was limited.
DEBRA WAGNER,You keep trying to send a text to a home phone line for code #.  Changing methods did not work
CARLOS SOSA,"I called M in regard to a notice from you about funds from an IRA acct. I had a change of address that didn't reflect the move on my driver's license. All my other info was good and I  answered all questions needed. A phone rep went to a supervisor and they ok'd it as is. I thought I had submitted everything correctly but was told that I had not. I submitted it again and it went through. I was then told to resubmit my drivers license. I explained that I was broke, and that that was one reason the supervisor had ok'd it. I was told misinformation and there are no notes on it. This has caused me problems. No money. I was expecting this money at the beginning of the week. I am still broke so thank you M for your great service!"
T WALTERS,"Great Customer ServiceMillennium Trust Company was very easy to work with! I've been trying to rollover my 401K from a previous employer for some time, but it just fell to the backburner. When I reached out to finally roll it over, I was told my birthdate was filled out incorrectly by the former company's HR department. I worked with BJ specifically and she went ABOVE AND BEYOND to help me get past this road block. We were on the phone for nearly 40 minutes; she was very kind and explained the process in simple terms to help me rollover my 401K.  I hope her superiors see this message and can pass along my praise!"
customer,The Milleninum specialist were so great and helping me out tru the process of guiding me.they were with me on the whole time tru the phone on how to filling out some forms.thank you so much for your excellent service.
JOSHUA MORRISON,Very resourceful. Five starts!
JEFFREY RAWLINS,The worst customer service experience I've ever had.  Trying to have my IRA transferred has been a huge hassle.  They claim to never receive any of my forms so that they can continue to charge their exorbitant fees. I can't wait until I dont have to deal with them any longer.
Amber Dunham,"Easy process, Fast and efficient. Thank you"
MARY GOLDEN-EGGERSDORF,I am still having difficulty trying to register and get verified

Tracey Maney,"The process to sign up was fairly simple. Not totally clear at first, but everything worked out."
ANA G,i didnt get to ask all m questions  so not overly happy. i felt forced into rollover and not able to really ask about just taking lump sum and pay the tax on it. i will call back today
MATT G,My representative that helped me was very nice and extremely helpful. Very satisfying experience.
ALICE CORRENTI,Everything is perfect in a short communication except impolite robotic answer!
JOE LEONARD,The customer service representative was very helpful.
CLAUDIA ALVARADO,"Company took over my old 401(k), turned it into an IRA and then made it a pain to roll it over."
SADRAC RICHEMOND,Trying to get my account number for weeks now. You have my information but I still do not have my account number.
LORI FLANDERS,Can't recommend Millennium Trust. They seem scammy from the get go.  Charge ridiculous fees. Make it hard to transfer my account to another provider.  Odd business hours. Gray UX patterns on their website.  Long wait times. When I did talk to someone they said they would send an email.  The email did not help and has only put me back at square one.  All done to intentionally making it difficult to get away from them.  No wonder they have only 1/5 stars from the BBB.
CHRISTOPHER BAIZE,I was on hold after being transferred to agent . Never got to speak with someone !
RAVI SHANKER,My retirement fund was in a force out due to me not notifying my original company that I had changed jobs it was picked up by millennium and it was super easy to deal with these people on getting my money where I wanted it great company
DANIEL MARTIN,Easy website. Not so great service
JANET RODRIGUEZ,Very friendly platform user friendly prompt responses

Johnny Bravo,"Still waiting to see if my withdrawal went through, but the process was simple.Helpful customer representatives as well."
Lin,Getting someone on the phone was challenging but employee was very helpful and made it easy for me to get everything accomplished.
Jonathan Merison,"My 401k rolled over to them after I left my previous employer. All they do is charge fees and nickel and dime you but do absolutely nothing with your funds. They don't reach out to you to see if you have questions. They do absolutely nothing other than charge ridiculous fees while your account earns $1 or so, if you're lucky. Happy to be moving it over to a place that will actually invest it for me and  help me grow it rather than taking it all for themselves.Edit to respond to their response: That doesn't change the fact that Millennium does nothing but nickel and dime their customers to provide ZERO service. Still glad I am moving away from them."
VIOLA SHECKLES,"I have been with Millennium for about 10 years.  For many years they were great and had wonderful customer service and response time.  However, MTC, like just about every other company in the US that isn't a mom and pop organization, have gone to the default model of not hiring adequate staff.  I have needed to contact them twice in the last few days, and have waited on hold in excess of 45 minutes on both occasions.  This is not on customer service people but on management.  To my way of thinking, wait times of over 15 minutes are absolutely unacceptable.  HIRE SOME MORE PEOPLE!!!"
BRAYAN SALGADO CARBAJAL,Quick excellent on line service!  Thank you!
Sandra Olson,It was super easy and fast to get answers to all my questions.
Frensha Taylor,"I have two (2) MT Trust accounts, however, your system only lets me access 1 account.I am still in need of a call so I can access my second 401k account"
JM,"I like using your online services. The transaction I processed was seamless. No problems, got it done in a matter of minutes."
Shemeka Stills,"I have tried to call multiple times only to be on hold for 20-30 minutes. I left a message for a call back, no call back. I emailed for help. No one contacted me. On top of all of this your company charged $10.00 to an already low balanced account. I am extremely happy I closed my account."
CLARISSA BOATWRIGHT,Nothing to say. Clear and helpful.
MARYBETH MESSINA,Literally everything about working with Millennium Trust was easy.  I got someone on the phone within minutes and they stayed on the line with me while I navigated the system online. I def recommend using them if you can.
ALICIA WILCOX,Very happy with all the help Vibha provided!!! I don't know anything about this stuff and she was patient and gave great easy to follow instruction.
rogelio rodriguez,Cashed out my retirement fund from my previous employer. The lady was very nice and patient. She stayed on the line through the whole process.
Holly McBride,Millennium Trust Company makes it difficult for people to access the money that they have earned. The lady is spoke with in customer service was nice at least.The process is ridiculous.
Gary,I was extremely happy with the 5-star assistance I receive from the Millennium Trust agent that I spoke with! I was able to accomplish my goal and she gets 5-stars! 🙂
TRACEY FLEMING,Was very vague.  I'm waiting on my distribution.  Been a week.
XUAN NGUYEN,The transfer of funds from Millenium Trust was extremely easy. All done online within minutes.
VALERIE KASUNIC,I didn't not care for only being able to reach someone after hours and mainly being directed to the website to process everything.
Steve Stanley,"I felt the operator was guessing, still uncertain of how my rollover will work. Looks like when you want your money out you receive a cold shoulder."
BRENTON HARD,"My hard earned money was stolen from me. I worked for a company, when I left my money was transferred to Millennium. No one ever called me regarding investing the money that was transferred. I was charged way to much money to basically house my money in a Millennium account. A horrible experience. So glad I was finally able to move my money out of this account."
Jill K,Your site was very assessable. I had no problems having my needs met
ERIKA MARQUEZ,Everything was fine easy to use and understand
RIOVINA ALVARO-PEREZ,very.  good service thank you very much

NICENGER,"Did an amazing job, helped me out with a big problem that my daughter and I were having trouble with. Walked us through it step by step! 10/10!!!"
JD,The web site did not tell me how to follow where it is
Madeline Jay,$35 annual fee$10 fee for printed statements (that I received in the mail & did not even request)Less than a quarter of 1% investment income
John Queen,Rep didn’t seem to care about my situation and did the minimal to help.
JAMES GENDREAU,"I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone based only on that they are incredibly hard to get in contact with. That alone was enough to make me withdraw my funds and deposit my funds elsewhere. It took me an entire 2 weeks of calling daily, leaving messages before I was able to get through to someone after a nearly 45 minute wait on hold. they have your money, they should make speaking with them a breeze.  If you are not interested in ever speaking to someone at this company then this is the place for you, but if you value your investment and want to talk to someone I HIGHLY recommend you look elsewhere."
TIM,"This company took over the 401k after a former employer decided to use them. By the time this happened, I had already resigned from my position and moved to another state to attend graduate school. The Millennium Trust Company sent a letter to my former address informing me that my money had been moved to them. After years of NO REPLY from me, no one from this company thought it best to try to reach out to me by any other form. No one searched for a death certificate or anything to know why I was not responding. Worst, while the money was sitting here for about 4 years, they were taking ""admin charges"" or ""maintenance charges"" from the little money that I had no idea was with this company. My money had been sitting at this company for years and by the time I got a letter on the off-chance I returned to my previous address just a few weeks ago, I learned that the money that had originally been with the company had dwindled to roughly 1/2 of the original amount because of the fees they were charging for just holding my money, not even investing it or doing anything with it. No one decided to track me down via any other means except by letter, which was being sent to my parent's address, where I had not lived in years! If this were the other way around and I OWED this company money, I would get calls, emails, and all other forms of communication from this  company so they could recoup their funds. This company preys on the unresponsive nature of their ""clients"" in order to steal from them! I WILL MAKE SURE TO NEVER RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY TO ANYONE. ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE."
PENNY LERMA,Great process which was secured to protect my private information and wishes for a distribution into my previously established personal checking account. I will come back to Millennium Trust in the future.
n/a,I needed my money due to a life event and they are helping to speed up the process
JERRY THOMAS,My prior employer transferred my 401K to Millennium which basically means unless I get it away from them they will take fees until I have a Zero balance!
SANFORD ANTHONY,"Helpful person on the phone. Website was a bit hard to deal with, if I remember."
JOSH CYPHERS,"Said she would send me an email to proceed, which was the entire reason for my call. No email sent/received. Clearly you know my email address, so that isn’t the problem."
NINA PEER,"I am very pleased with the entire process and responsiveness of your service.It simply is about communication and in my case, the experience between us, was great!Thank you so for your help!George GreenGulf War Army Disabled VeteranTampa, Florida, USA"
FROSINA SPASEVSKI,"i called Millennium Trust at the beginning of this month to find out information on how to withdraw a very small amount of money I have had with the company as I continued to be charged a yearly service fee.  Lady was very abrupt and told me to figure it out online in which I tried.  With hearing nothing back I called again this morning to have the woman on the phone be nothing but polite, compassionate, kind and patient to explain to me that when I went online I did not complete the process and walked me through to the very end exactly wanted needed to be done.  If the first Lady was a 1/4 of what the women was today in our world it would have made a simple task not so complicated, confusing, frustrating and lost still waiting for a response from your company.  Kudos to the woman today for remembering what Customer Service is all about.  Thank you"
TIONNE EM,"Had a wonderful telephone conversation with a representative. She was very kind, and very patiently guided me through all of the steps necessary. A truly delightful- and increasingly unique- experience, these days, and much appreciated !"
Fonso Blankenship,I received the service I was inquiring about in a timely manner. Everything was easy to access and easy to navigate.
JEFFREY MILLER,I like to for time being keep the IRA 401k account and also the IRoth traditional account there a little longer because if I take it or close the account I'll get charged.I mean that's what my bank told me or if you could send me a paper check and I would put it in my account without getting any penalty or charges.
CHARLES MEDLEY,Outstanding service The agentWas so informative and patience In addition to interpersonal skillsMaid my experience 10 starMany 🙏🏻 thx
BARRY,Its been 4 years trying to take out my money and they can't help for nothing
EO,"My account was transferred as part of an acquisition of Liberty Trust.  My experience with MTrust since the transfer has been terrible.Claim to work for their clients... seems far from that.Always claim to have high call volumes, hold times are often 30+ minutes and when you reach that threshold the line is hung up.Operations folks are inexperienced and don't know what they are doing."
Jill Chunn,Thanks for help me
Frank Perez,I was informed that I had an IRA retirement account from a previous job with Millennium Trust and was able to log in online and get it transferred to me in minutes. My money appeared 48 hours later.

KRISTEN HECKMAN,The lady I spoke with was very helpful and could tell she didn’t mind helping me with my paperwork.
Meg Rego,"Yikes, this company is a bad joke. Is this even a real company or some kind of mass mailing scam? It’s either a scam or the dumbest, most dysfunctional customer interaction system I’ve ever seen. Wow. I curse my former employer for trusting my money to these clowns,"
ELVIRA ALVARADO,"Nothing to choose from, EVERYTHING is super price inflated! I DO NOT RECOMMEND"
M YOCKEY,Thank you for being simple and thorough !!
KALYAN GADDAM,"It was easy to navigate the website. I only had trouble uploading a copy of my check for my funds to be deposited into my checking account. I just think if you have provided the routing number and account number, you should not have to send a copy too. Just my opinion."

Customer,"You have no way to get a hold of a human on your phone line, your chat is glitching, and no one answers your emails. I made a mistake in requesting a rollover and there is actually NO WAY for me to go back and request it doesn’t happen. This is extremely frustrating and I’m super disappointed in the way your features don’t work."
Haida Mojdehi,"Once I was able to access my account, it was very easy to take care of my business."
nope,I was a repeat of a dispersal and it was very painless. Thank you. I just wasnt told how quickly my funds would transfer is my only concern.
Rebecca Kane,"My experience was not great, I received a letter in the mail, followed the instructions, I was answered by an automated call.. kept asking for a representative.. finally after asking 5x for one I was transferred to some lady, she was rude.. I didn’t even know what I did wrong from the very beginning.. I didn’t even know about the account I had.. she guided me after I told her I didn’t mean to bother her day.. she was mean from the very beginning.. I finally got what I needed .. and finished .. I’m sorry for this but with no information before had I was prepared for guidance.. i felt like I interrupted her day.. I hope nothing else but she treats people a little better.. with more understanding before she got nasty.. I didn’t get a name because I was shocked how it started from the beginning.. just ready to get off that call.. I hope this is helpful.."
MALISSA MARTINEZ,"The process was very easy, the representative was very informative."
ALLAN DSOUZA,"It's good that it takes you step by step,  but it takes longer to hear back about being approved for suretan subjects."
IRYNA GARMASH,"So far the distribution process has been very easy. No hassle. After sending in my ssn card along with my W2 from my previous employer in order to verify my IRA and identity, things are running smoothly. I have a separate mailing address at my moms house a mile away and I use it because some mail boxes were broke into. And adding My mailing address was simple, unlike some companies act like giving an alternative mailing address immediately locks your acct and there are hoops to jump to get it unlocked. Senseless. I also like the fact that I can get my funds on a prepaid card. Very nice touch. Todays day and age keeps us from wanting to put our bank info online , so the fact that I just approve some forms click click and my funds are otw! Organization with Millennium seems to be on point. I’m thinking of getting my funds putting them with my husbands and sending the money back to Millennium to invest and keep safe for retirement. Last step is actually receiving my funds so stay tuned…. But as for now GREAT WORK MILLENNIUM"
Judy,The experience with your company was good but unfortunately I needed my money to pay some bills during these hard times.
Heidi,My first contact with Millennium Trust was friendly and helpful. On the phone they were informative and no waiting. Online the site was easy to use. I found what I needed to do and completed my transaction in one attempt.
JOSH K.,"Retired from that position in 2014.   You had $400.00 for 7 years.   Worthless as Dutch.  No percentage gain, Like holding it in a bank  ;Worthless, just like the job that promoted  it Cash America Pawn.    Don’t rebuttal, no communication at all."
SAMANTHA HERTE,Letter sent to home has only partial account number requires full account number to set up online access
Jessica Mitchell,I'm just average as a computer user . But I managed to do what needed to be done without any help. Much easier to do on line . I called and was put on hold for a half an hour and was then disconnected .
FRANCIS GOESER,"I still don't have my 1099-RThey said they'd call me to tell me where to get it, and that it's in the mail. that was a week ago"
JEZA VEA,I called & requested to have my 401k account closed. The person I spoke with was very courteous & professional. I then received an email from them that I filled out & a check was mailed to me in a timely fashion. Thanks Millennium.
Mark,Quick and easy experience to withdraw money from my IRA.  I had a question concerning my direct deposit and the representative was very helpful in answering my questions.   I highly recommend using this company!
Brian Campbell,"Predatory business which thrives by adding to their bottom line via your money. You're better of with your money in a coffee can buried in the back yard than with this group. Millennium Trust consistently takes everyday peoples hard earned money they are trying to change their future with so they can enjoy their highly privileged lives even more. -1000/10, Strongly Not Recommended!"
Keith Droge,Yikes Yikes Yikes
Morgan,Excellent because they help me out everything that I need to do
MEGAN,The lady that helped me today was amazing
DIANA BUSACK,"Millennium Trust is corrupt.  They accepted a rollover from my retirement fund in the amount of 75.00 and when I closed my account, sent me a check for $25.  This is dishonest to say the least."
EP,What a friendly courteous customer service service representative and she had to wo  t k on a Saturday !!
Shey,"I have $280 in the ira account and Millenium is charging me $40/year to hold money until I retire. So, after money was in account for five months, I now have $240. And, after six years my account will be $0. Millenium will have stolen my money. I guess I will owe them $40 every year after that just for having an account.  I just now took my $215 out of account after the 10% penalty.  A lot better than having $0. heh"
SHO YANG,Very Easy to work with...
THOMAS,The representative was very helpful and did everything fast.
Rafael Quiliche,I withdrew funds for personal use. The online form was easy to fill out!
Thaddeus Mayo,"Everyone there is very pleasant, helpful and patient. I'm very slow on the computer and needed help to finish the set up. I needed to call twice. Dolores of Chicago was so great with all her help."
RICHARD BABB II,Pretty good I'm definitely going to come back
KUMRAGIE SINGH,Very helpful representative. Very accurate step by step instructions!
Kelly Johnson,"I did not choose to have my money sent here and after my experience I never would. Not only did I never receive information from them about the status of them taking over my funds, but when I finally found out they had them, the process to try and make an account to get funds back has been painstaking. I am over a week into making the account and still haven't received the verification to access what to do with my funds. 0/5 stars."
Cheqousia,This was a bad experience!! I tried calling just to simply roll over my 401 to my present job and they said call back later lines were too bad so I went online but it kicked me off so I called then they said I was already registered but I couldn’t get on it to roll it over !!!! Total disaster and a waste of two hours of my time
BRUCE BALDWIN,Excellent Customer service. Very professional. A long with speedy service.
HMatteson,"Called MT as a new client for help accessing their website and my new account. I could not establish access therefore could not peruse the site and my new account. When I called, Bruce the initial customer service rep was nice and pleasant but could not help me so transferred me to another department. The recorded message gave me the option of holding to talk to a rep or pressing 1 to leave a message.  I opted to hold but within seconds I was hung up on. I called back 2 more times and was hung up on both times. Finally, I called back and used the leave message option and was told someone would return my call within 24 hours during normal business hours. We'll see ......"
BRIAN MORRIS,Excellent service and excellent help. Very knowledgeable and helpful staff.
RAMCOOMARIE VEERASAMI,Absolutely no help. I can't even get my money out
gail,This is really hard to get in contact with too much information as we have to  give and then you can’t reach nobody to talk to you live! I didn’t even know I had this account I don’t get no updates or mail about this account I have to get divorced to find out this smh! I am not happy with this I will close my account asap….
ADELA RIVERA,"Good service, good comunicación"
ARTHUR HUGHES,"Millennium trust was very hard to get in touch with or shall I say speak to an actual person. Also, the service was very slow to send me a statement as I had to request one but the have had my money since November. I understand there are processes but dealing with this company for the first time was tougher than expected. My grip is with the communication and retrieving information but the customer service associates were not rude when I could finally speak to one."
Bear Mama,"This company bought out my existing 401k company. And they have seriously been THE WORST. Absolutely impossible to create an online account. Customer service phone number just refers you to use the online account that you can't set up. The only way I got to speak to an actual representative was to say I wanted to open a new account. Even then, it took 6 emails from the representative to complete the one single form I needed to transfer my money out of their service. Then I had to pay a fee just to get my money transferred from a company I didn't want to use anyway! Just stay away."
Christine Morago,It took me awhile to figure out how to make a withdrawal. I needed to talk with customer support a couple of times. They weren't the most helpful
Anonymous,"Excellent service! Site was easy to navigate, documents were easy to read and understand, and my payment was processed rapidly. Definitely will recommend."
TAMARA WINER,Very detailed and thorough instructions and information
John,Representative was very helpful and polite
JOSHUA GUAJARDO,Customer service below average. Makes you feel like you are an intruder interrupting their valuable time.
CANDACE WILLIAMS,"Customer service was very informative, provided all the steps I needed and even waiting for my emails to arrive, stayed in contact, thru the whole process, Aces in my book!"
H Roush,Pleased with service.Questions answered promptly. Representative was courteous and knowledgeable.
Adrianna Crowl,Every person I dealt with was exceedingly helpful. And I ask alot of dumb questions. The customer service was awesome. Thank you for having the training and resources to have a truly great customer service experience.
TRACY RICKETTS,Very user friendly interface.Most of the forms were self explanatory.I was able to request rollover with-in 10 minutes.
JOSHUA BURT,"My phone call today with an agent was very helpful. She was very knowledgeable, and solved my issues quickly. I appreciated her efforts and help.  Thank you"
Courtney Robinson,Really great customer service!
RANDALL NESST,"First things first, I did not choose this company. A leftover bit from a 401K with a previous employer was sent here by that employer.Fortunately it was not a lot of money, because Millennium Trust took over 80 percent of it in fees.This particular transaction was my cashing out what little was left, and that part went smoothly, so there were no issues with that."
Deedee,Great and east
KEVIN BURKE,I needed help with my account and I was emailed a link to help me while I was on the phone.
Grace Canonigo,"I am new to this company but so far, a good experience. One downfall is the hassle to talk to a representative."
Bryan Thomas,I never got the documentation or information I requested in my email
Josh,Fast and easy!!!  Thank you!
CASSIE B.,I spoke with Tara and she assured me I would get a tax form sent to me which I never received. I received a call explaining tax form mailed only if distribution occurred during tax frame. Happy someone followed up and upgraded my rating.
MICHAEL BEYER,"Somehow my account, small as it was, lost money the past year. My savings account at the very least maintains what I have.No, I won't come back to you unless somehow forced to do so, and if that's the case, I'll pull out from you as quickly as possible. That's my review.  Please remove me from your mailing lists, all of them.Thank you."
ROBERT JESSA,"I received courteous, timely and efficient assistance.Much appreciated."
Jodie Kleinhans,"I’m a new costumer in Millennium Trust, but is good to everyone know that the costumer services is great!"
JOSEPH DALTON,"As my account was relatively small, the quarterly management fees exceeded any gains made so I was losing money every quarter. From a financial standpoint, while it doesn't necessarily make sense to close an account, it also doesn't make sense to continue eroding the existing asset over time. Thus the reason for closing the account."
JOHN SWEETING,Millennium trust was very fast at getting my funds to me. I had to withdraw my funds however due to the fees that were slowly eating away at my funds.
Nice!,"When I finally got someone on the phone they were helpful but everything until that point was just unnecessarily arduous. If you've had a pension roll over to MT, I feel your pain"
JON WALZ,"The Web site & user interface worked fine but has a dated feel. It gives the impression that the technology used behind the scenes at Millennium may also be dated. It doesn't build confidence that the company is using modern approaches to shepherd people's assets or that they are safe & secure, tech-wise, from cyberattacks / cybercrime."
M R,Robyn is my hero! Fixed my problem. Awesome!
ANDREA COLEMAN,"I called in to ask a question about the IRA that was transferred to them from my former employer. I was pleasantly surprised that the wait time wasn’t very long at all even though that said it would be. The representative on the phone was polite, knowledgeable and very patient. Great Experience!"
DAVID CARAPELLA,Website was easy to navigate and easy to understand. I executed a transaction in minutes all online.
RENEE SCHAAL,Customer Service is very helpful and informative.
Deanna,"Had a paltry sum in my savings plan with another company. It got transferred to MT after I left my job, charged a $75 transfer fee. I leave it for a couple years, somehow not making even modest returns, and am losing money instead. I’m irritated, cancel the account, charged a $25 fee for a transferred account I never even wanted to be transferred. At this point I have around half of what I started with from fees, losses, and punitive closing because this company is a nightmare. Thanks."
TAMARA BEEBE,"Very nice, courteous and patient person.  Took care of all my questions."
JAMON KUKICH,"After the transfer of the company, I was losing everything I had gained over the years. Fees were more than interest and gains."
Sara Sippel,It is very secure. Thank you
name not disclosed,"Extremely difficult to deal with. Just trying to set up user ID and password too all day and is still not set up. I'm getting away as soon as possible.Oh, and what out for all of the fees."
M. A.,I great Experience. Very helpful
Davis Saunders,I just needed some help with a trustee to trustee transfer of funds from my Millennium Trust self-directed IRA account to another brokerage. The paperwork is always a bit confusing so I called customer service. My wait time was less than a minute before I was talking with a real person. They walked me through the procedure and paperwork quickly and clearly. Problem solved. Excellent customer service.Thanks.
Tammy M,You received my funds via a 3rd party... and charged me to withdraw them. Unscrupulous.
CLICERIA BRIETZKE,The person was extremely helpful in fulfilling my questions and needs. Great job!!!!! Thanks
Alma Lemus,"The email response was boilerplate and didn't answer my question at all.   But when I spoke with the lady on the phone, she was very helpful."
MICHAEL THOMPSON,"It wasn't easy to open the link you sent to me; however, one of your representatives helped me. His name is Luis.I do appreciate his help. He was very professional; He was patient. Thank you very muchl"

jhghufkgjh,I needed a distribution of funds and I could not believe how easy your online platform was to use and how quickly I could complete this task!
MARIA PETROVIC,Very easy to navigate and understand exactly what I needed to do!
Lourdes Perez,I called after my IRA was rolled over from an former employer. I filled out the form to receive an cash out distribution. I received my payment the next week in my personal checking account. I had a good experience with Millennium. Thanks
Elizabeth Coxwell,The person on the phone was very patient and answered everything he could for me.
Zimer Rizvani,"Bailey was great!  She helped with all aspects of my request in a friendly and professional manner. I would have given 5 stars if I hadn't had to make 2 different calls due to long wait times on hold. 30 minutes the first time before I gave up. I called 3 days later and spent 20 minutes on hold before bein transferred to customer service. Luckily, that was only a 5 minute wait before Bailey picked up."
No Name,My experience was good
RONNEEK DEALE,"I am trying to get some help, and all I get is being being sent round in cirles. ""Call this number"" ==> ""Access this website"" ==> ""Call this number"" ==> ""Access this wbsite"" ==> etc., etc., ...This is atrocious.Will somebody please help me?"
Donna Ott,I am on call with customer service for more than 30 minutes but the issue is not resolved. I am being transferred to one dept. to another but no resolution
RONALD ROBERTS,Still waiting to see where my fund is.. I've asked for a distribution and still haven't received it. It's been over a week. Along do I have to wait.
AMY SCHAEFER,i was supposed to receive a call back due to technical difficulties and have not yet heard back.
Ed T.,"Ward was excellent in explaining the 1099-R for my tax filing. He made my mind at ease why I get this document, of which I freaked out. I must say, he’s better than my therapist."
Christopher Whalen,"I found the representative I spoke with to be friendly, respectful and professional in her efforts to help me understand my position.  The steps required for me to remove the small amount your company has not acquired by fees were explained and our plan is to take our loss and separate ourselves as far as we can from your organization.  You are welcome for my small contribution to your wealth."
JESSICA A,"If you can get someone of the phone to assist, it normally works out ok, maybe with some unneeded additional hassle, but it works. Nothing is simple or inexpensive. But getting someone on the phone is an issue. My recent experience causing this poor rating relates to my attempt to call them to discuss what looks like a double fee billing per our most recent account statement. After waiting a long time to get a human, I was told that she was not the right person to speak with so I was placed back on a very long hold, which I eventually hung up on. So I emailed in my issue. The response I got back was to call them since they could not discuss account info over an email communication. This is very far from good customer service."
EMERSON,I appreciate how quickly Millennium Trust completed my request.
JASMINE,Super easy to use and great customer service
ARMINDA QUINTANAR,"I called Millennium Trust when I received a reply to my e-mail to CustomerService.  I was not aware that I had an active IRA dating back to anemployer I had not been employed with for over 20 years.  The CSrepresentative patiently took my information & e-mailed me the formwhich I could complete and submit online.  I received a confirmation regardingthe IRA account within an hour.  Very efficient, professional and excellentcustomer service.  Thank-you very much for persistence in this matter.It was much appreciated."
Jody Navejas,Difficulty requesting direct deposit to close account
Hans Horrigmo-Cook,Rude customer service from the card call center and kept getting hung up on about 8 or 9 times when asking for a supervisor.
Luke,The agent was very helpful.  She stayed on the line with me until my distribution process was complete.
LUTHER ROMO,"I don't like being charged fees just to have my money exist somewhere... Some of my money disappeared before I even got to access the account. Where'd it go?? You could have helped me invest the money, that could have been a win-win for both of us."
RICHARD MEYERS,Asked for hard copy of my accountWas sent email. No way to copyHave no copy machine.  NotEveryone is tech supplied
LUIS DELAVEGA,Everyone was so good to me with helping answer any questions I had
RICHARD MORALES,The process for receiving my distribution was fast and easy. The associates were courteous and knowledgeable and were able to explain the process in terms that were very easy to understand.
LUIS T.,Most difficult process I have ever been through took me a whole year to get my money and figured out all I gotta say is good luck
customer,I was charged a fee equal to 40% of my IRA transfer.  This is usurious for a transaction that essentially cost them nothing as it was executed electronically.  Caveat emptor. Please put your money elsewhere.
ADRIAN WILTSHIRE,Thank you! You site was easy to navigate and I could get done what I needed to do!
Cheryl Casey,Quick and easy process would highlyRecommend.
CELESTE HAGGERTY,They really explained what it was they were trying to do

Robert Brady,Every representative was helpful and understanding.
Natasha,The young lady that helped me was very professional and had great knowledge of my options and was very helpful and guided me in the right direction on how to solve my issue.
KRISTA DAVIS,I have a hard time accessing my account on line and trying to get through to a agent is ridiculous. I will be transferring my account to another company !!!
Jennifer,Ridiculous hoops we had to jump thru to get money transferred to another bank account. Customer service was not helpful and didn’t seem to be consistent with policy.
DAVID SCHADT,Customer service was very good
Kelly Young,it was easy to use and people were really nice and helpful
JOHN A SOLTER,"The phone system will ask you repeatedly if you’re sure you want to speak with a human due to long wait times, after saying yes 5 times it will tell you the long wait time is 2 minutes. I had been speaking to the machine for longer than I had to wait for a representative who was virtually no help as they told me to just log on to complete a form, which I told them the system wasn’t letting me access. It was clear they would be no help so I tried to log in again and the system doesn’t even have the form I was directed to fill out."
JANICE RAMOS,There is no one to help with service. Can't contact customer service for support
Jean d Arc,I appreciated the girl who helped me she’s a real one

MARTIN MENDOZA,Not helpful. Deducted funds from my account and told me I submitted the wrong paperwork! Tried again but no resolution. Took my money out. Customer service reps could be better trained
Lee Marie,Did not like their website and fee structure.
BRITT G.,I spoke with 2 different representatives on 2 separate occasions and both were very helpful and patient with me.  They both walked me through the processes related to my call.
HUAIQUIN HENRIQUEZ,representative was very helpful and handled the issue quickly
Wynton ,The staff was very helpful and understanding when I had questions.
Curry,"Representative does not listen to the issue.  I just need simple information, yet she refers me to online account management which I clearly state that system does not work properly at the beginning of conversation.  I try to explain to her, yet she talks over when I explain.In the end, issue got resolved."
Gabrielle Brieger,Got me the information I needed quickly. thanks
JENNIFER PETERS,Had a GREAT experience. Representative was Great sooo helpful kind and courteous. Such a Pleasure to work with.Thank You

ZACHARY BALDWIN,Everything was very easy to understand and went perfectly smooth. Thank you for all your help.
DANNY TRAN,I had money transferred from my previous employer and was set up as a traditional IRA.I had the unpleasant experience of having a financial problem and needing money. I had the money transferred into my bank account with no problem! I thank you for your assistance and look forward to working with you in the future!
Florence Chen,"I understand “bad” is the option I selected. I wish there was a selection worse than bad. I am in disbelief in the level of accountability this company and its representatives have in helping the consumer. I was told by a supervisor Yesenia P. that it was MY responsibility and the organization does not bare a fiduciary responsibility to the customers because the account was transferred to Millennium Trust from my previous employer. There was no attempt to empathize or understand the situation from the customer viewpoint. I understand parameters and guidelines are created for the best interest of the company, but the customer loses when there are charges put an account every year for 10 years without the customers knowledge nor authorization. I will never do business with a company that values their bottom line and forgoes the customer experience. Maybe losing one more customer does not impact you but the treatment I have received will have a lasting impression on me, my family and every person I tell this story to.Update: when I titled this review as “Disingenuous Representatives” I was referring to the few that I have come in contact with. After speaking with the manager Mike P, I am beginning to think that is the culture of Millennium Trust. Mike P. did not reach out to me to provide help, he wanted to further explain why the company is justified in charging me hundreds of dollars. The justification was: 1) address search they conducted (hard to believe when information is readily available with today’s technology), 2) having the ability to access my account online (even though I never used the service), and 3) the funds were held in their institution (even though I am responsible in managing my own account for any gain). The most insulating part of the conversation is when he offered to waive my fees to close my account. I am not aware of any financial institution that charges $20 because they can not send you a statement, $40 annually because the funds are sitting in an account they do not manage, and $25 to close the account.  The intent of this organization is to deplete the account by any means available. Per Mike P. they will keep charging fees until the account is at a zero balance. This organization doesn’t seem to have an escheatment process, it charges fees until there is no funds left. Why would anyone want to be a customer when their intent is clear."
Aragorn Franklin,The process of obtaining money from my IRA was very easy and the person I spoke with was very helpful.
Luke Gale,Still waiting for my card. Nothing as of yet
LAURA GALLAGHER,"The account statement I received in the mail was very important and when I called to follow up, the response I got to my questions were rather vague and dissatisfactory."

ROXANN ANDERSON,Awesome service
JANICE HALL,Both customer service reps were very knowledgeable and helpful.
Felix Holmes,I like the fact that you guys held on to my retirement funds

DANEEN King,It took less time to recieve the funds than the first time..immediately happened in 3 hours
Maureen Casey,Great & extra fast service Thanks !
AMANDA W,The portal is easy to understand and navigate.  I was able to complete all transactions without having to call someone for assistance.  Very helpful!
Helped by Ms. W in Pittsburgh,"These guys are a royal waste of money. They did absolutely nothing except take money in fees. I took my money out, put it in a Robinhood account and am getting waaay better returns than Millennium Trust. Word of advice: Take your money out and open an account with Robinhood, WeBull, ETrade, etc and put your money in an EFT (if you're uncomfortable investing in individual companies). Mutual funds are managed by a person and you will be charged fees. An EFT is managed by an AI and there are no fees. So the management of the fund has no self-interested bias.Save yourself money and leave these guys."
A GRILL,Good customer service
Andrew Howard,My salesman was very upfront with cost and was able to get me setup with system next day with a very likable technical person who worked with us to learn everything we needed to know about 360 alarm system.
RACHEL LARSEN,Still waiting on tax papers. The last thing to file.
LISA CHELF,I was very pleased with the excellent help from the few people I talked to. The last gentleman I talked to walked me through all the necessary steps and process. I will refer Millennium Trust to others for sure.         THANK YOU
BERNARDO SAENZ,"This has been the most disappointing experience I’ve encountered in all of my financial dealings.  While the personnel were polite, the process is extremely difficult and appears to be geared to obstacles in requesting ones distribution. What’s tragic is in this case we are speaking of under 2,000.00 which I’m sure is nominal in most dollar amounts. Recently I’ve had the experience of dealing with the New York Life Annuities Group and was truly treated professionally, equipped at every juncture to access what was mine, and then offered investment options for consideration. And truthfully they were dealing with over 300,000.00 rather than a mere 1600.00. Night and day is what I would call this experience. The customer service was professional, personable, helpful at every turn with even a follow up two days later to be sure I was pleased with their service and the outcome of my decisions (NY Annuities Group)   And then compare the pervious to this…from the Millennium Group:    The response was simply all of our processing is done online and we don’t have the ability to help you (Milllenium group). Isn’t “customer service” focused on the customers experience and the the convenience of a process designed strictly to be done online?  Or maybe I expect too much!"
NICOLA AYERS,"Horrible,can’t get into my account,been going on for a year.they are NO help."
GERALD HORN,The phone rep.(Jackie) was very helpful and very much appreciated :-)
JAIME MCALARNIS,"Simple, easy, and to the point."

Stephen,It was a wonderful experience Thank you very much
MARK STULTZ,"Hello. In the past I did not have a good experience… basically, it was a bad  communication. Since I started to speak to Pauline. The communication is great. She is knowledgeable, friendly, very easy to talk with. She resolved my problem. She has great customer service skills. Thank you Pauline. Have a great , smiley, safe, sane and healthy day.  Alcinda."
Grouchy subscriber,"I am trying to roll over from my Millennium account and your process makes this very difficult. Someone should look at that.I thought I had a solution once we spoke, but was disappointed again. When I called in wait time was 10-15 minutes. Schwab requested a copy of my most recent statement and when I tried to log into the portal, I could not even update my password. These are IT problems, not customer service problems. Someone on the web apps team needs to check their customer experience better."
Cheryl Dubon,"I got prompt response to my question about how to transfer funds from my Millenium account to current employer's plan, and the online form was easy to fill up to request for a distribution, phone call was also quick, didn't take too long to to reach to a representative and she provided detailed guidance on how to get this done. Thank you!"
MARTHA CHRISTIAN,Website is very unfriendly to users. Frustrating experience just to move a rollover account.
MICHAEL COX II,Easy to use and understand

SEIKA RODRIGUEZ,Good service. Had Millennium Trust since my old job. I was able to get my funds the same day.
DIVINA LUNA,"I did not chose to use Millennium I was forced to by my bankrupt employer who transferred my 401k to Millennium.  To get set up and your money out is very arduous.  I am glad I don't need the money immediately, but would not recommend this group to anyone."
JOHN BROWN,Lady that help me was very kind and patient with me . Thank you
Doug,"I gave you all 5 stars rating for excellent job when I need helped over the phone last week.Thank you,"
JASMINE ALLMOND,I needed a personal withdrawal. Process was easy and quick. Website was very helpful.
Alana Taylor,You charged a fee on my account when I was not contacted that my funds had been transferred to you and then charged me a fee when I closed  the account.No email or phone call to inform me of the situation.
Susan McBroom,"My ex-employer rolled part of my 401K into Millennium. My first statement informed me they were taking $30 for an anual service charge. When I asked for the account funds to be distributed to me, they then charged $25 for that request. Just seems excessive--Update--I received a call from Millennium couple of hours after the original posting agreeing to refund the $30. The $25 us used for filing docs to the IRS after my withdrawal seemed fair. Changing my rating to 4 stars"
Ray,Accomplished what I needed to do!  Very helpful!
HANNAH MAKA,I don’t remember the ladies name but very helpful beyond customer service
SHEILA VEAL,Still have not gotten my card with my funds on it .
VERONICA GRAVES,The fees are often and high. I never wanted to do business here it was an ira rollover from a previous employer. No one should willing want to do business with a company who wants to fee their customers to death.  Even to close account yet another fee. They should be investigated and no one should do business with them. Called to talk to someone its 100% automated and to transfer funds takes forever you have to do it online only. This place needs to go out of business. Hope people files complaints with the district attorneys.  I see the same reply about fees to all. That's why I roll everything to etrade no BS fees like this scam company. They only want to charge fees and suck you dry look at the reviews over and over and over again.
DEBORAH GOMEZ,"Best experience I have had in a long time.Everyone that has helped me with my needs at Millenium Trust has been most excellent.  Extremely polite and knowledgeable.  If I were to say I have had any negative experiences, it would be having to tell the welcome recording 4, 5 or 6 times that I want to speak to an agent.  Thanks and keep up the good work and get the recording fixed please."
Wendy Alviso,Service 10 out of 10! No hassle No fuss.

Jordan Greenlee,"My retirement accounts were transferred to Millenium.  I attempted to log in through the website.  Only one account would show up despite repeated efforts.  I attempted to reach MTC by phone at the number in BOLD at the top of the paperwork.  ""Call volume"" meant the phone system would NOT let me speak to a customer service representative and directed me to call back between 5pm-8pm Central time or 8-noon on Saturday.  Calls at these hours were greeted with ""office is closed, call back during normal business hours.""  I got up at 5 am my time to reach someone in person at MTC after a 5 minute phone tree and a 10 minute wait."
KLAUS OPOKU,The website and working with customer service on the phone was all excellent.

DOUGLAS MOORE,"It's understandable to pay a yearly fee for custody of my account, but since I've been out of work and not contributing since the lockdowns, I have lost about 90$ just in custody fees. It doesn't make sense to keep the account when I'm just going to continue losing money for the foreseeable future."

C NUGENT,A great service that made it easy to utilize and understand all of my options

PATRICIA KIM,"Awesome, direct deposit took only 30 minutes to arrived at my bank account."
valued customer,Terrible customer service. Very slow and it feels like you are being difficult on purpose so I can't pull my money out and you can keep taking high fees. Disgraceful and I can't be done with this company fast enough.
Douglas Center,"I have tried to work with the agency to get my money moved to my new retirement account. Instead they never sent the paperwork they assured me would arrive, and continued to not communicate with me or keep me my investments working. Instead I lost all my money from ""account fees"" and now owe them money to close the account. Never received great customer service and feel preyed upon because I was young investor with no knowledge of how to use my tools/account."
BRAXTON WILLIS,Very easy to use will definitely recommend to my family and friends
C. James,The people at Millennium Trust were most helpful in guiding me. I was quite confused on what to do but now I understand.
MORTON HIBBERT,This is the most useless company to invest in. The bank gives better interest. I got $42 dollars over the year and they took $30 for management. then another $10 for one letter to tell me how poor their service is. Tried to get my money out and they will not even talk to me about it.
DEANNA KNOX,Easy to address what you need to do online.

STEVE REEVES,I need to talk to a person. Please contact me.
Kathryn,"I was new to Millennium Trust because an account with a former employer was rolled over to them.  I appreciated TMT's diligence in reaching me about this account. Once they found me it took several months to get my account open due to some technical glitch and reps kept sending me the same non working solution.  When I was able to reach a person, several months later I was talked into how to solve the glitch and that was great customer service.  I then received another communique about stuff I had to do to verify the opening of my account. Annoying. Did that. Get into my account to see the amount that's been rolled over.  Too small to leave with MTM, BUT I loved how the site worked once inside. Decide to get distribution of that amount but want to keep the TMT for other funds I'd load later in the year.  Getting the distribution, which I want to invest elsewhere I have to leave $200 in or forced to close the account.  I don't like that, decide to take the full  distribution. TMT charges me $25 to close the account I'm forced to close! That feels predatory....Dang, thought this company would be a strong solution to other funds I want to invest.  NOT going to happen because, in the end of all things, too difficult to access and sign up for funds they have told me are in their holdings for me, then too difficult to keep a relationship that I would have wanted with the company going. Not a problem, I have other investment companies that don't have this difficulty or exorbitant fees to the client for following policies the company has put into place in order to have a relationship with its client."
TYLER COLEMAN,"I'm very pleased with the manner with which my account was handled. Very professional, red tape kept to a minimum while security verified my identity. Overall experience - excellent."

ROBERT PORTERFIELD,"I was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer that has spread to my liver, spine and hips. I had to make the decision to close my account so that I could keep my house at the same time that I am going to going through chemo. I don't have enough words to say how helpful and blessed I was to speak with a supervisor that took the time out of her day TODAY to let me know that everything that she and I spoke about yesterday was already in process! I was having issues on my end and she was able to see what was going on and help. She is truly blessed and for that I am grateful! Thank you so very much for being on there when I needed an angel!"
MICHAEL EFRETI,"Very friendly, helpful and responded quickly. Thank you!"
customer,"Our involvement with Millennium Trust was involuntary: TIAA moved funds from a TIAA account to Millennium Trust. We're still not sure why. It was a small amount, but not small enough to ignore.On the negative side: we never heard anything from Millennium Trust: no statements, no investment information, and no acknowledgement that we even had an account.On the positive side: once we initiated contact via email we were furnished with a support number to call, and the support person was helpful.The support person was professional. The company in general has been a disappointment. We will move the funds to a Fidelity IRA."
Margaret,"I do not contact you often. The times I have, someone has been very grateful, professional. I am grateful for the help and aid."

SUSAN A,"The support team from Millennium Trust were very good and responsive to my needs and concerns.  Asking them for their assistance, since they put me on hold to contact the personnel which could get the job done.  I appreciate the concern they showed to me and help they gave me."
THOMAS MIDDLETON,In all honesty this is a great company to have an investment in! The reason I only rated them with 3 stars is for a couple reasons. First: There is a penalty for early withdrawal for anyone under 59.5yrs old. -What if you become disabled and ‘like me’ are forced into early retirement before that age?? Secondly: Trying to take personal control of your account in order to have access to ‘your own money’ is like trying to fit a camel through the eye of a needle. Way to many hurdles to jump through in my opinion. If either of these two things aren’t a real concern for you them yes I definitely recommend using MillenniumTrust for any and all your future investments.
JOHANNA DURAN,It has been a complete nightmare for the last few years to try and transfer my accounts.  I cannot wait to be done with this mess!

ANITA CANSLER,"For the entire time you had custody of my money it consistently decreased. Both my Roth IRA and my Traditional IRA that were transfer to you from TIAA. There were excessive fees on one of my accounts, which only contained a few hundred dollars.  For the last year (before I closed it) it paid a whopping 24 cents in dividends, while accumulating $45.00 in fees.  To add to the injury you charged $25.00 to transfer the remaining money to my bank account."
CAL PFLUGRATH,"Representative was very helpful, efficient, and professional. Thank you and have a good weekend !"
JOSE PEREZ,"Very Helpful,"
JAMES WEEMS,Have tried calling customer service several times because I was left a message to do so but with no reason why. Each time the wait has been 20 minutes or more. My day is busy enough and cannot be kept on hold every time I call this company.
WILLIAM STANFORD,Great support with an immediate solution to my access problem.
Lucy,"Your associates are top notch, the people answering the phone calls, but your automated voice service is the worst I’ve ever had the displeasure of dealing with.I’m hearing impaired and your automated service does not provide equal access. I’ll make a strong guess that the automated system is not ADA compliant by ANY means, based on the several times I’ve called."
JONATHAN URIAS SERNA,My account was moved to MT from a previous employer. MT kept me informed of activity on my account. It was very easy to transfer my money and close the account.

Will be transferring account else where."
CLARITA MORRIS,Mtrust is a very good company to do business.
EMILY WILLIAMS,"I received notice a left over portion of a 401k plan was dispersed and Millennium Trust now handled it.I followed the procedures outlined in the notice and on their website.  The money was transferred out seamlessly and within a few days.  I saw several negative reviews and don't understand why they would have issues.  It mostly sounded like user error.  All I know is that I had a short, efficient, and productive interaction."

Anonymous,"All good once I found out funds had been transferred from another provider to open up account at Millennium Trust.  Surprised and disappointed Millennium Trust didn't contact me alerting me that an account had been initiated.  I had to find out on my own, over a year after the account had been opened.  Would also have been nice to know terms and conditions of the account, not the least of which included a $ 30 annual fee."
ALISON DENTON,The gentleman was so kind patient and polite he walked me through step by step until I got it and then we ended the call.
KEIRRA,You have stolen my few dollar i had with your company in outrageous fees. No wonder you keep on getting richer. You never notify me of this fees and don’t receive a statement. Last time I contacted you was in 2014 and at that time there were no fees incurred.
RAMMOORAT SHARMA,"When I call customer service they are very nice and try to help. However, I have yet to receive my welcome letter and it is very frustrating because I need to be able to log into my online account. When I try to get help from customer service they can't tell me anything other then I should get the email in 3 to 5 days. No one has been able to give me any other information about my account and why I have yet to receive an email or anything from the company. So as of right now I can only give a 3 star review"

The people who answer your calls - like the woman I spoke with today - are clearly in the US and are knowledgable, articulate and just seem to be good folks."
JOSEPH ALFARO,"There are some things that worked well, once I discovered that my IRA funds were deposited in Millennium. Registering and signing into the web site were a pleasure. Navigating the website was less so. Instructions on where to go to do something were not accurate, as things were in subheadings and were not visible on opening a menu, and this was not indicated in the instructions.Somebody in IT should have a newbie to the site and ask them to accomplish tasks, and see how incoherent it is at times, at least for a layperson like myself."

Antonio Norman,Good customer service
HELEN BENOIT,My money was transferred from my previous employer in the amount of 2000.00.  Over the past 4 years I received statements with the balance reducing each time.  Nothing was done to increase it or to ask if I wanted to add or do something different with it.

DONALD DUNCAN,401k was moved here and converted to an IRA. Money was no longer invested in the funds that I thought it was. I did not realize this happened for quite some time. They claim I was sent a welcome package but I do not recall seeing it. After I got my yearly statement it was dissapointing to see that I lost money due to fees despite my other mutual funds doing so well.
CHRISTOPHER MALAWICH,"It felt overwhelming and confusing to rollover my funds. I feel like the instructions to roll over can be made in a more user friendly format instead of a monolith of a list. Customer service was a little impatient when I was asking questions. Understandable, but also didn't feel nice."
CHARLES LINDAS,"I’m pleased with the company & their customer service. I needed to withdraw funds and their process was easy to follow. This went smooth and I had no issues. I did have to call a couple times for help with some specifics and the agents were very helpful, friendly and knowledgeable."

In addition your representative, Jacquee Porter Renfro, was very disrespectful and unhelpful in trying to resolve this issue before she escalated it."
RYAN T,Well my experience was absolutely terrific from contacting customer support depending on the time you call.although they do offer a call back service.  The nature of my call was a distribution of funds. The customer support sent me a link to my email address. I followed the instructions and I had the money in my checking with in 30 minutes of completion of the online forms.
Sabrina  Do,"I spoke with Katie and she was not the first representative I advised of my website problem. Katie immediately knew how to solve my problem and it was an immediate solution. I was actually thinking of leaving your company because the problem prevented me from accessing my assets on your site. She not only fixed the problem within minutes but she notified the prior rep that the problem had been resolved so he didn’t have to follow up unnecessily. I was so pleased with her genuineness to want to help. She is a definite asset to your company and she should be recognized for her excellent recognition of your customer’s needs. Sincerely, Phyllis KatzPS:I now enjoy your website…."

Very happy that I will not ever have to deal with your customer service in the future!! As a customer service professional myself, I urge you to hire more competent employees!"
CONNIE GOEBEL,The representatives I spoke with were extremely helpful. They sent emails while I was still on the phone outlining step by step what to do for my rollover. The website was simple as easy to navigate.
MARK MILLER,This was a smooth simple transaction. I did have to wait a long time to speak to a CSR!! She was very helpful told me what I needed to do and that was that.
CALSHUAN TOLIVER,Completely satisfied web site user friendly and staff was on it from the initial call
JASMINE,"The online account set up process was simple and took just a few minutes. I wanted to withdraw funds from my account, and that paperwork also was quick to complete. I was stunned to see the funds in my checking account later that same day!"
Brittanie Thomas,Great and easy going experience. Thank you!

Alina,"Just very help team, everything went smoothly."
Daniel Contreras,"The representive was absolutely amazing! She was very kind, patient, and extremely efficient. She walked me through the process regarding my IRA account. She treated me with ultimate respect. I felt valued."
Tom,"Hard to get ahold of and when you need them to send forms to you it takes them forever ehile they continue to nickle and dime you! I would not recommend Millennium to anyone, so many fees to go along with so much bull crap! Not worth your time, money or effort! Save yourself the hassle and look else where!"
Richard Guzman,"The previous times I spoke with customer service reps, I was met with NO patience and NO help, this time was different. The reps. name was Baily, and she was very patient and completely helpful. She is a great rep. for your company!"
Joshua Wuensche,The associate was very.helping in recommending what i.should do
ALLAN MATTS,I have been attempting to rollover my plan and have been hung up on several times. This is a very poorly run organization.
WILLIAM TROCHMANN,Great service and easy to use. Would definitely recommend this company!
Jennacz.,"On the phone forever waiting for a representative. Left my number for a call back, no one called me back. It's because of the pandemic?"
DAVID W.,"The process for accessing and transferring my funds held by Millennium Trust is complicated and burdensome.  A option should exist for persons to access and manage their account that it is not digitally based.  When I realized that my money was sitting with Millennium and had not collected any interest for an entire year, I was sorely dispappointed and simply wanted to transfer those funds to my existing IRA, managed by my financial planner."
SCOTT B,"Poor customer support. Endless waiting on phone lines and chat. No transparency of transactions or waiting periods in the online account. Overall, a negative experience"
NARINE PETROSYAN,Make it to difficult to access. After being verified
JORGE RODRIQUEZ,Hard to get a human
ROCHELLE PARROTT,Excellent customer care.  Very helpful. Thanks again
Cynthia,charge redicoulous fees for transferring an account that should be free
BRANDON CARDWELL,You directly stated in a phone call you made to me that you would waive the $10 close account fee as a courtesy due to the small account balance.  You told me this at 2:30 pm. I closed the account at 8 pm the same day. The next day the account close fee of $10 was taken. A complete lack of integrity by Millennium Trust.
David Smith,Website is not helpful. Unable to access account and complete actions. Website sends you back to old forms.
MELISSA Cabrera,I could not log in to my account even after providing required security questions. Iwas told to call or email support. I emailed and then was required to call support for assistance when available. I called after work and had to wait for a call back after 30+minutes. They took my security info and removed block so I could access my account. Agent was polite and helpful.
Michael Warner,"Good service team member, but I needed the back end team to release the restriction on my account and it still isn’t doneEDIT: eventually it was resolved a few days later so I’ll give back one star"
Denice :),MT was used by a previous employer to hold my 401k I had with them. I opted to cash out as opposed to roll over. Simple process. Wish everything online was this easy. Thanks.
KAYLA THOMPSON,Great customer service
TOI SHELBY,Fast and efficient.. I'll be back!
DONNA OCONNELL,"I am retired and live full time in La Paz bcs Mexico.I have no ties in the USA. I am a resident of Mexico.It took at least 5 different Client services people to complete my information approval.And when it was said and done, I received $2700, not the $3003 dollars that was quoted to me. Also there was Zero follow up after I was finally approved.I had no idea I had completed the paperwork correctly until the wrong dollar amount showed up in my Bank account.I was told by the last representative that she would call me back in 1/2 hour to update me on what was going on. She called 3-1/2 hours latter when I was in my car driving and couldn't answer the phone.A simple remedy would be to assign a client service to my case so I wouldn't have to repeat everything each time I spoke to a new person. Plus your wait time sucks!After reviewing your response I dropped your rating to the lowest available.In your own words""The reason why you received what you did was you indicated for us to withhold 10% for tax purposes. I have a copy of the document I submitted and it is clearly marked- I DO NOT want 10% with held. Please correct your mistake"
Tashina Weathers,Very helpful and quick access to my account.
Donald Seals,Knowledgeable representative and very pleasant
Rosemarie Chance,"A+, great experience. Very easy portal to use."
Jason Sandoval,We were not in formed when our account was transferred to Millenium and lost 8 years of income from having it invested or even in a bank.
MELISSA PAYNE-WESCOTT,The representative I worked with via phone answered all my questions in detail and was exceptional
RIKEVIA WELLS,"I had called to inquire about my withdraw, though the wait time was roughly 20 minutes that is to be expected. The fact there is an option to be put on hold, and then called back later at the number you called from was great. Typcially websites like this will give you all options when it comes to sending in legal documentation. However, on the website for withdrawing it does not tell you that you can send in a voided check via email too, it only lists mailing it in, or attaching one at the withdraw process. When I called, I was given far more and applicative information then I had expected, and found I could email in what I needed too."
SHAUN,I was charged $30. In an account I didn't k ow I had. Just toClose it
JORDAN MILLS,Thank you.  I was dissolvong my account and you made the process easy and quick.  Often times your money is tied up too long before you have access to it.
LINDA MCKENZIE,Customer Service rep called me back and i was able to handle my transaction with her help. Service works best with call back option.
Renee Cheatham,"I closed my account and took out all my 401k and after I put the request in, I immediately got it in my account.  Super fast and very friendly on the phone"
WHITE/JAMES ROY,"There was quite a wait for actually speaking with someone but when the rep came online, David. He was very pleasant polite and very helpful in getting me the information that i needed to transact my queries."
ADAM DETROY,Customer service was outstanding. The employee knew what she was talking about and gave me specific and complete directions.The website needs some work. I was given a tracking number but I could not find a page to use it on. I have no idea to the status of the closure of my account with your company.
LEO TYLER,Excellent customer service ! Did what they said they would do ! Very good communication ! This Sr citizen appreciates that !
sjr,"HORRIBLE experience on telephone.  Waited over 30 minutes only for a very rude person to say:  ""you have been transferred to the wrong department.  I will put you in the proper queue""    No explanation.  Just click and back on HOLD."
ERIKA LARSON,The representative I spoke with was very helpful and kind. Thank you for being great!!
Paul Blart,Agent was very polite and extremely helpful. Gave me a complete understanding of what I needed to know.
Holly,The only issue I have is that it was difficult to get thru to a live representative.  Hold times were very long and I had to call back during various times in the day to get to a live person.  Once I connect with a live representative they were extremely helpful and stayed on the line answering all my questions.Thank you
Curtis Watkins,"Little confusing, at first. Worked out just fine."
Phil Byrne,Know nothing about the company.  The website is not user friendly.  Trying to contact a customer service representative is impossible
MILDRED WEBBER,"Just found out about this account.  Only had 47.00 in it after a 20 fee was charged to the account.  Took over 4 hours to close the account.  Multiple phone calls and emails.  Wasted more time than it was worth, just needed to close it so they could not take it all and give them the satisfaction.  1st person I spoke with was rude and not helpful."
David,I have been trying to do something with my account for months. I finally got the help I needed.
JEFFREY CLINTON,Agent was knowledgable and helpful
Kimberly Holmes,Easy to use. Just waiting on payment
Marci,"I want only one account because I’m nearly retire soon, thanks to helping me"
Steven Wodiuk,It is impossible to get a to a live person. My previous employer transferred my account against my wished even though I had already requested disbursement through previous company. Then in order to have my account opened and closed within a few minutes I was charged both an annual fee as well as an account closing fee. This is ridiculous. There was no work or effort done. I had your account for a total of 5 minutes yet you justify taking $55 out of my money for what exactly. This is a total joke and would never even considering investing with you guys. Apart from that tried to use your customer chat which is not a chat. It is is simply a commonly asked questions search. Then emailed your company 3 separate times and have yet to receive a single response yet it says you will contact same day or at latest 24-48 hours later. Horrible service
H.J. Wil,A surprise message from you informed me of a 401K balance I had from a previous employer. Your directions to help me cash it out were seamless and very user friendly. My money arrived in my account within a day.
ABU SAMMAH,COMPANIES SHOULD CONSIDER NOT EVERY ONE. LIVES BY COMPUTERS SOME OF US DETEST THE HIJACKING OF THE WORLD BY COMPUTERS !!!!!! RLJ

Lyndal Gilliland,So easy to use!
stanley ordman,"Customer service rep was awesome.  She walked me thru the entire paperwork process.  There were questions and she was on the spot asking them which lead to me understanding.  Again, thank you Ms. Rep for your professional.  Marcus"
Eric Bodrick,It was quick and easy
Becky,Process was extremely easy and quick. Thank you
Jesse Renteria,The fact that you take 30 dollars a month as a service fee for a retirement account is dumb.
MISTY SAWYER,You need to do a better job informing those who accounts were transfered by way of a former employer.  I have two complaints (1) I assumed the transfer funds would be invested (as before) and garner profit and growth.  Since May of 2020 my money basically sat and was not invested in the market and I did not gain money consequently.Secondly and equally egregious is the lack.of quarterly statements which would have alerted me to ask why am I not seeing any increase in the value of my account.
Kelly,the processed was fast and easy. I appreciate the easy process
Alicia Parker,"Take your money elsewhere, monthly service fee, closing fee."
Millennium Victim,Funds were quickly deposited in my bank account once I closed out my account

SHAWN KAPTUR,"I received something in a mail today (February 5, 2022) stating that this company that I have never heard of somehow had my RothIRA in their possession. I was charged a $40 fee to open the account and then charged a $25 fee to close the account.I received a phone call on February 8, 2022 from Frank. He explained what happened and we came to a satisfactory resolution to the issue."
BRIAN AKERSON,"Your customer service was terrible!, but navigation of your sight was quick and easy,  thank you"
ALA,Real fast and made sure everything was correct
JOHN CARTER,I was very pleased with Millennium Trust and would definitely recommend anyone to them in the future. Every situation others have I realize is different but it's all in how you handle the client or customer. In my case they were so professional and kind and considerate in my situation. I was totally impressed. I received a letter in the mail from them didn't know them and had never heard of Millennium Trust I actually started to throw the letter in the trash thinking it was a scam and I looked at it again and Googled them checked the B.B.B on them and then called them. They were exceptionally nice. When it comes to money changing hands you have to be wise. In this case I'm thankful they researched and found me after several moves on my part. Very highly recommend this company. I hope everyone can have the same experience as I did with them. 10 stars everyone at Millennium Trust.  Oh and I'm not an employee or friend I'm for real just a working single cautious woman. Thank you  for all you did for me Millennium Trust 🙏 Valarie

Iman Nikinejad,"Thank you ,You company was very knowledgeable and very patient with me , customer service is outstanding . I gave a 4 star only because the wait time is very long i stay on for 60 minutes. Other than thatIf i didn’t need the monies due to covid  i would have left my money there. Thank you in advance for your service and Hopefully i can come back and invest Lorene"
Rashaad Barber,Made it all but impossible to get my money to spite me never willingly having an account with them. Still don’t have it after years of trying.
Kori Ryan,For years this company held my funds safe till i was ready to do business very professional online secure site they verified who I was several  ways before giving any info I’ll certainly use millennium again
DOLORES GARCIA,It was very helpful the help they provide i would recommend friends and family to this company100 percent.
BRADLEY MAINES,Quick and easy distribution. Website is easy to navigate.
IMELDA FARRELL SCALLION,I’ve been trying for over a year to transfer my money. The good- the customer service reps are always nice and seemingly helpful on the phone. The bad- it never actually gets done.

MEM,Great staff person assisted me on phone. Person explained how to navigate the website
YOLANDA SANCHEZ-LAARIF,"Excellent service, wait time was horrific, my wait was over 30min."
Swarley,"The customer service process has gotten much better since I last called a few years ago.  I had a very patient nice woman on the other line.  It was nice that it was an American.  No disrespect to India or their fine people, but those call centers there are not always expeditious or fruitful.  I would have given the process a 5 except that I had to spend 15 minutes after the call filling out computer forms, ostensibly to prove my identity, which I had done over the phone. That was frustrating to me"
Linda Whitmore,Vert east to work withHelpful in explaining all the forms I had to fill out and verify the information. A++ Customer service.

che,"I had questions which were answered quickly, succinctly, and professionally"

TYMESHA HARGIS,"I’m just bitter that I got charged an annual fee on a prior employer’s 401(k) force out to IRA.  I think advanced notice would have been received better, so I could have transferred the funds before getting charged. I got notice of the conversion in December and got charged the annual fee in January."
KHU REH,I called few weeks back and used prompting system to have them call me back … nobody ever called me back.   I had to call them.   I asked for paperwork to be mailed which I finally received .    Today I called there and due to their being busy and nobody picking up I used the prompting system again.   Once again nobody got back to me.   I recalled again few hours later and as of now no response back.   I am disgusted  with this company.

ROBERT REYNNELLS,Great customer service and even called me back when we were disconnected super helpful
LAURIE THOMPSON,Very efficient! Thank you!

LAURIE,Thanks for helping and answering all my questions. You did an excellent job.
KAREN LUCAS,Great service!. Easy to used online.
NK,First time working with the company and  I had a good experience. The Customer service rep was nice and pleasant to talk to and very helpful. I made a withdrawn and the process was easy and the transaction was completed at the time they gave me.  Very happy with the company.
Eric Taht,"Takes forever to get the account verified, and really disappointed about having to pay $25 to close the account."
T Money Millionaire,"The distburment process is easy enough,  but it's listed that the process only takes 1-2 business days and that's not true.  I would suggest listing it as 1-5 business days so you have time to actually get the money into clients account."

WILLIE GUZMAN,Awesome thanks

TERESA CABELLO CORP,"They call back in the afternoon and when i called back i could not get past the automated system to a live person. Can't get to a live person to answer my questions.Web page did not work well enough for me to get answers either. Automated system will not allow connectio n to a person and hung up on me...

PEGGY TYSON,This was an effective and speedy process. I was able to navigate through the process without any major issues. The professional manner in which this was handled was awesome! Again l thank you for your professionalism.

DEBRA HORTON,"Attentive to my needs, customer service was phenomenal."
Brian,"Friendly, and Quick to expedite my request."
abby,"I would give Millennium 0 stars if that were possible.  Considering that they are a company handling my money, they were evasive, oppositional, and used circular conversation tactics to not deal with my problems. My money was transferring from my 403 b into an IRA with them and I wanted to move it back into my work account. It appeared they hired specifically trained people to work to not make this happen, and to make it so difficult to move money out of their company that the customer would just give up. Since I want my money with a company that I feel I can trust, they did everything I can think of that would make me not trust them."
RAY,Jessica was amazing and answered all my questions
PAUL LAIRD,Unable to help over phone they only want to give website. I am having trouble with that.
Ronnie,I called to get help and I was directed to the website. I made a login which was super easy. The only difficulty I’m having is trying to figure out how to put money into my Roth IRA. The person I was speaking with seemed pushy to get off the phone so I didn’t get to ask them much on how to at least get to where i can link my bank to my IRA.
Ruben Flores,Customer Service personnel was extremely knowledgeable and able to explain and assist me in <6 minutes.  Greatly appreciate your team!
MOLLY HIRSHFELD,The lady that provided assistance was very patient and helpful. She answered all my questions and even went above and beyond to give me access to more information about the type of accounts offered.
TERESE Urbach,No wait time. Obtained what I needed and got help updating my info. Great service.
Mary Casey,"The customer service was awesome! Although the recording said HIGH CALL VOLUME it was only like a hold time of 30 seconds. The rep was kind, patient, and provided step-by-step instructions. I just wish the account management side was half as good."
Saul Berland,I was very please with both my phone conversation and my online closure of my account.
Tanner Colton,Customer is fast and easy.
TIFFANY RODGERS,"Phone tree is awful- doesn’t answer questions and takes forever to get an agent (I’m not including hold time in this)Agent didn’t have answers as to why document isn’t working correctly (one section says to skip section E if you select it, but then the document forces you to complete section E anyway). Agent also has no explanation as to why I was receiving emails telling me to complete paperwork. Sorry, but this is why I am leaving Millenium Trust. I don’t want my money with a place that can’t even get the basics of customer service right. I don’t wanna know what they would do with my investments."
DONEE,Very easy to navigate through each portal.
Anthony Catoggio,The process was simple. Representative was knowledgeable and ready to help. This was a flawless experience.
NOLLY CALIMLIM,I have tried to get money out four separate times and it wouldn’t let me or cancel my request and am still trying to pull my money out
BRIAN SEVERNS,"Easy to use online system, hassle free."
DONNA,Very easy to navigate web site and process my 401k plan
Danny Wedgeworth,The company I was working for was sold and the 401k was transferred to Millennium Trust. I did nothing to monitor the account and still it grew in value with your choices for me. I'm only taking the funds because I'm having a house built. Thank you for all the hard work and decision making that has made the new house possible.
SHAWN BALLOU,Wonderful help perfect customer service y'all go above an beyond to help with what ever may be to get what the customer need I appreciate all your help thank you

Brenda Lynn,Easy and fast.  No problems.
JESSICA TIDWELL,"Had a few hundred dollars, from my job as a medical technician, that I told them before I got hired that I do not want any form of 401k or anything like that but care one cupola went ahead and made one for me anyways and the money they stole from me to put into this fake account I never approved was stolen by your company's fees. I will never invest money this way because of this and I will always advise everyone to go for crypto or NFTs before wasting their life and money on this."
Bernadette Bisda,Very simple to work with. Website was easy to use.
MANSOOR NASEEM,"After multiple attempts (over several months) to log into my account or reach a phone rep, I was about to give up. Tried calling today and after a 20 minute wait spoke with a very patient rep who walked me through the online form/close my account."
AUDREY BROWN-WELLS,I was able to fill out the form online and they processed my paperwork in a timely matter.
kim,I expected a hassle and I’ll finally you know I spoke to someone and I’m not the computer savvy and she stayed on the phone with me the entire time until I was done very satisfied very easy and I already got my money 💴🥳👍🏻
TIFFANY COLEMAN,"My 401K was moved here by a previous employer because my new employer could not roll it over right away. They took well over a couple hundred dollars, and then when I could finally transfer my money out they charged me a $25 closing fee. What a joke. The only good thing I do have to say is transferring my money out was easy and we got the check in the next couple days."
RYAN CASTRO,"Payout still has not been received, customer service never returned call after being prompted for a call back… When finally speaking to a rep, rep seemed to not know the process or how long it takes… Stated it would be expedited that was over a week ago… It was a week ago that it was stated it would be expedited, paperwork had already been received… Request was submitted on Jan. 19th, it is now Feb. 4th… More than 10 days…"
MICHELLE MALONE,"Not only was my money transferred here without my knowledge, MT didn't tell me for over a year that they had it and they had taken out several fees by then. It then was difficult process to move my money out and by that time, and after more fees, more than half of my money had been taken by MT, a company I never asked for."
Katie,I spoke with a representative today well versed answered question that I had I was very satisfied with the customer service I was given today.
Gretchen Glass,"The web site is very well organized, explanatory, and easy to navigate. Customer service was also very helpful and professional."
Joe Joe the Dog-Faced Boy,"My money lost value and your UI/UX did not help me figure out how to make money from your services. It made zero interest, and was attached to no investments, just cash sitting there dwindling in value by your fees. When I wanted to distribute/withdrawal my money a few years back, I had to get a banker from my network to liaison such a transfer since at that time I could not directly withdraw my funds. All in all, I made the mistake of keeping my money there for so long, and no one bothered to reach out to me, to at least guide me to use your services and have us both make money. Your company was the only party in this arrangement to profit. That’s too bad, because I could’ve invested more money, but I had no incentive.Sincerely,Luciano"
Leandra Hansen,It was a wonderful experience working with you guy's
MICHAEL BRUMLEY,"There are delays when calling for help , also delays when getting my money / distribution out . A process of 2 and half weeks !!! It’s crazy."
Teal Battin,The application was easy to manage through for my request. When I called and spoke to a representative he was very helpful and explained what I needed to do in order to file for my request step by step.
GARY OLSON,Thank you for your service
New user,Extremely helpful. Pleasant and knowledgeable.
ROBERT MAGUIRE,Provide me with my distribution timely
SHEILA HUNTER,"helpful, polite and knowledgeable"
GEORGE CHIONG,Awful customer service as in none
LAUREN WRIGHT,"Had to change distribution of funds was easy only issue was detting the ID verfication form to load, but phone and Email helped to make finishinf this task"
Kelly Folz,"Followed instructions. I am a technical person. I solve other people’s tech problems, but the system never allowed me to do what they said."
DAVID BARNES,"I never asked for my funds to be dispersed to these clowns. my old company lied about how they were going to deal with my 401k and these guys just drained fees from it for a year until i finally was told it was in their possession. get your money out of this company as soon as possible, or better yet don't let your old employer disperse your funds in the first place.just an edit because they replied - this company does not pick up the phone. i'm not going to go through the trouble of wasting hours of my time or hassling their phone representatives over $20 or so of fees, either. To be clear about the ""it's your responsibility"" line - My old company made no efforts to contact me at my updated addresses to let me know that this was being done, and MTC took their sweet time finding me as well despite all my address changes being a matter of public record with the postal service. MTC operates fully within the broad auspices of finance law, but that doesn't mean their service is worth using or that their business practices will benefit you in any way, shape, or form. My review stands. This company's purpose for existing is to buy up 401ks from lazy employers and to skim fees off busy people."
customer,Millennium received my 401k from another company that was supposed to send my funds to me. Millennium took the 35$ annual fee for an account that was not to happen then told me to take it up with the prior company.  This is not acceptable business behavior and i will not do any business with them in the future if this is standard policy.
Keith Richardson,"They don’t call you back and mentioned, when on hold."
Alan Lau,"Worse experience of my life, company gives terrible instruction and explanations and just gives you run around after run around I don't know how anyone can get their retirement."
Amy Waugh,"Called to find out about account info, directed to go online to get the information, then online directed me to call in again. After a 30 min hold, got what I needed. I understand security, but the circles you go through to get simple information is ridiculous. However, the agent I spoke to last was very professional and polite."
BILLY WILSON,Professional - much appreciated.
ASHLEIGH WRIGHT,"I was down and out , had to draw money for emergency ,and it was fast and covienient . Thank you very much ! God bless."
MINNIE ELDRIDGE,Happy with all services. Thanks!
MARIANNE,"Very hard website to understand, the staff was not helpful at all. I will not be doing business with them"
TH,Didn’t know what the money was but it was easy to find out! Very easy process to either cash out or transfer to another IRA. Thank you!
Andrew,Everything went very smooth and efficiently. The person I dealt with was very helpful.
SP,Help was swift and efficient. Much appreciated.
STEPHANIE SAUCIER,Very fast. Really helped my family out. Got rid of credit card debt in mins. Payments were reasonable. Lower than what I was paying out in minimums a month. Thank you team for everything!
Samuel Clark,"My previous employer without warning rolled my IRA over to MT, who then began sucking it dry little by little with ""monthly fees"". Every attempt to close the account or transfer the funds to an actually trusted company was slowed down by MT to the utmost degree. Over 8 hours were spent on hold trying to get answers or information, and to add insult to injury when the complete extrication from MT finally got worked out the company had to act as vampirically as possible and suck as much money from the account as possible with the account closure fee."
RHONNA CARTER,I still do not have my money! Frustrated
JAMES JONES,"Ridiculous and painful, frankly.  It appears obvious as to why you drag people through such a tedious and arduous process but I suppose you don't care a single iota while you sit back and collect fees (penalties) while the accounts sit idle.   Most people, myself included, don't have time to deal with the process, especially for such a minimal amount that we either dismiss it or eventually get around to it when we receive a year end statement, in my case this has been sitting in your account for 3 years. I suspect you all sleep well at night.  Sleep tight :-)"
June Hernandez,"Exceptionally high management fees for cash just sitting in an account.  Fee to obtain the money was a high transaction fee.Customer service with Maurice was fantastic!  He was patient, polite and knowledgable.  Those are the rare characteristics of someone that actually cares about all customers, even those with virtually no money in their account."
GLENN STOLLE,"The company over charges in fees $45.00 a year on a account that makes $1.45 in interest. That's a total loss of $43.55 a year, they are a worthless investment company when you actually run the numbers."
ROBERT LAFERTE,Utterly useless.  All I needed was a 1 page statement faxed or mailed and they couldn't do it.  Then talking about charging me $25 for it.  I didn't choose you for some reason Trans America transferred my account.
Riley ,I still don't have access to my account and it's been weeks.
Grace,"I had a great experience talking to an agent, they did a great job helping me out!"
RICHARD LEWIS,Jesus Christ my Lord and Savior blessed me in a great way! This did a great job. I was able to receive my money with ease.
TODD BAGGETT,Helpful even though I was closing an account
JANE OYLER,Vicky was very knowledgeable and resourceful. She even emailed me the link needed for my concern. I appreciate all of your help!
Magda Davies,"Their business model is a complete scam. An annual fee of 25$, a withdrawal fee of $25.. and the worst thing is I never even chose them to hold my money— my 401k got rolled over to them by transamerica."
JOSEPH MONACO,I get an automated “assistant” everytime I call. Can you please provide a phone number to a person please.
BELEN GARAY FIGUEROA,Thank you for you service
ORLANDO C.,Very proffessional. Process was easy to do. Thank you so much!!
PAUL JAKUSZ,"The attention was GREAT. What more can I say? My matter was taken care of on the same day. Great company, I recommend EVERYONE to Millennium Trust. Thank you."
CINDY FINK,I had no problems with getting to talk to a customer service person. Everyone was helpful.
FERNANDO AVINA Ibarra,I spoke with the customer representative named Bruce. He was able to understand my query quickly and guided me through the next steps. He explained the solution with utmost clarity and with enormous patience. He ensured that I was given the right directions. He is certainly an asset bringing credibility to Millenium Trust through his excellent customer service
BONNIE RODRIGUEZ,"I had an issue accessing my account today- it seemed to be an issue with website. After doing some research I reached out on facebook messenger and received a reply to contact Kamila and was given a phone number. I was skeptical that Kamila was even a real person because I'd seen this same reply to other people on fb and twitter. But I called and reached Kamila's voicemail. After leaving a message I quickly received a call back- she's a real person! She was very helpful, diagnosed what the issue was (a recent change in their web page with a rerouting to a now invalid page) and walked me through exactly what I needed to complete my transaction. Thanks for your help today, Kamila!"
George Greene,long waits ok
KENNETH DYKES,"I received notification that Millenium Trust had taken over my IRA from a previous employer and noticed immediately that they had already charged an annual fee that was more than my interest earned. I was not notified of this change to my plan so I immediately closed the account and requested my money be returned to me. Millennium Trust, without any advance notification, charged $30 for an annual fee and then charged $25 processing fee for me to have my money returned to me. This all feels very dishonest, inspite of their explanation for their actions."
LATASHA BURTON,Millennium trust has a very user friendly website. Also they respond to your messages fairly quickly.  No complaints!
BOLDING,The literal worst customer service. You cannot talk to a human being and I have had nothing but problems with them.
HOWARD E,Appreciate the representative Vickie's assistance in walking me through the steps. Kindness included..
KMG,"The representative was friendly and listened to my concerns. The email Chandra sent was very informative. I should be able to make an informed decision concerning my funds. The wait was just under 30 min and your representative apologized, due to the time of the month."
HICHEM BELHADJ MOHAMED,I probably should have left my number with you sooner instead of waiting on the phone for almost 1 hour. But you did call back as promised before the end of the day. Answered my question so I'm pleased.  Thank you.
Linda,My employer moved my 401k to this company. First day my account was charged $35. Same day I closed my account and was charged another $25. Ridiculous amount of fees. I would never use or recommend this company to anyone.
Elease,Simple & easy. Great customer service!
Jim Irsik,The person I was speaking with was very patient and very helpful through everything that was done. I do appreciate the person I was talking with being patient and it was very helpful.
SCOTT SOMERS,"Short and simple, my 401k was transferred from Transamerica retirement plan to the millennium trust. My account gained only $5 in a 12 month period. On the other hand , I was charged by Millenium trust $30(annual account fee) and $25 (closing account fee) for moving funds to my bank account. Just do the math, horrible experience from beginning to end."
GWYNETTA HILL,This company has cost me so much money. I know I didn't have much but you took over $65. And have only had the account for 6 months. Thank you for raking us little guys over the coals.
Kathleen,"Good experience with the agent. He was patient, helpful and polite. He helped me get accomplished what I needed done."
JOHN NEAL,"Horrible customer service. Then I’m charged a 25.00 to close out my account that was recently transferred to your firm.I tried several times to get on the site to close it out and unable to do so,Then called to talk with someone and was disconnected 3x. Actually you should not be deducting anything from me. I am new to your company and didn’t chose your firm."
TIARA,"Vicky was awesome, she got me back on track with sending me the information I needed to create an account!"
VinnybKing,I experience several things when I found out that a precious company that I had work for had moved my 401K account to Millennium Trust.  I first had to upload a lot of my personal information to be able to see what was in my account and this made me uncomfortable.  due to so many scams going on.  Then I kept getting information back stating that some of my documents were either not readable or not acceptable.  So then I had to try to reach out to the company to see who I could talk to assist me so I could get through this problem.  Once I was able to talk to an representative I was able to finally get through the initial login to setup an account.    overall the site was easy to use and request for information.
Joseph Herald,Great service. Very professional
ALEJANDRA LOPEZ,I want to thank you guys for a great experience. I will be back when the economy changes.
DANA KLEIMAN,Person I interacted with was quite helpful. She answered my questions satisfactorily. The only holdup was waiting for legal to answer one of my questions.
Alejandrina Ovalle-mayorga,web site worked easy to use.
Ivee Maughan,Made trying to roll over my old 401k to my new employer sponsored one. Sent multiple emails telling me I'm trying to do something else and telling me to fill out forms already completed. Ended up just taking the hit too withdraw the funds early. Useless.
JAMES PARKER,"I just received a statement from your firm a couple of days ago.  The.funds were a very small amount, but on the statement a $35 account expense for the year of 2022.  I don't think this should be charged on a small account and I just asked for the account to be liquidated.  This fee. Should be prorated ."
TIM MEINTASIS,"She was helpful on finding out who the IRA cane from , an old employer . I was caught by surprise.  I'm glad everything is settled now ."
Frederick,Customer service was a great help. The only problem I had was with Erica in POA accounts. She hung up on me and I had to call back at that point she didn’t answer her phone and Gwen helped me thru the whole process. Kudos to Gwen in POA.
DANIELLE WHITE,"Wait time on the phone was > 1 hr, which unacceptable. My money was transferred to you without my knowledge, there are also fees involved, I have small amount of savings and you are ripping me off with all these small fees!Thanks"
MARY KISHBAUGH,Had to close a account an it was a breeze
RAMON ROSALES ARTEAGA,Extremely helpful. Answered all questions.

Cj,Thank you for answering all my questions! Got what I needed to know instantly.
LUPITA GENAO,Very easy and simple. I was able to get my money in seconds after completing forms online
SIOBHAN SOUCIE,"EDITED: I had a really stressful experience with an IRA that had been rolled over to Millenium Trust -- ultimately, through many long waits on hold and one public callout on social media, I got the issue resolved to a moderately acceptable level. To be honest, I don't know if that's Millenium Trust's fault, or a symptom of the general financial industry. If you have a rollover account with them, all I can say is be proactive, read every word of everything they send you, and don't assume anything."
ANA DE LA HOZ DEMARRERO,"Great, easy, simple"
Sabrina Trout,"I had moved on from a company that I had worked for years ago. My 401k account was transferred to Millenium Trust. I wanted to withdraw the money to pay for extensive auto repairs. The young lady I spoke with gave me top-notch customer service. She literally stayed on the phone and walked me thru the process of how to withdraw the funds from my account. I received my money within 72 hours. Thank you so much for your assistance, MT. I was truly in a bind. You helped me to again access to much needed funds!!!!!"
Debra Nordgaard,"To whom ever this concerns:I met the Millennium Trust personnel through my employer... and I have to say that Millennium Trust has treated me with respect..., and the patience that was needed; because of the fears that I had from the experience I gained through my previous employer, that fear was derived form the transferring of my money or let’s say savings, to someone other than myself.So you do realize that something was gained by the transfer that I didn't think was possible, until now.THANKS!Millennium Trust and keep up the ""GOOD WORK""!Just for the record I plan to become a ""MILLIONAIRE INVENTOR ""!"
Ruma Saha,The wait on the phone was way too long for them to tell me a 5 min answer to my question.
KORI,"Explanations and instructions were unclear, felt like I had to ask several questions to understand what was going on (rather than customer service guiding me)."
SUZI ZAZA,"re; Robert Sundeen Millennium Trust account #1v73REF753679.  Please request Millennial Trust contact me at 1847-927-3100 regarding the reason for my calls placed today. Extremely important.Called the 630-386-5600 twice today.  This morning, first time calling was on hold listening to your sales pitch for around 30 minutes.  Then I chose to leave a voicemail then was told I would get a call back.  That never happened.So I called back at 3 PM CST, 4 EST.  Once again, I am on hold so far for 40 minutes, then requested a call back. That is terrible service.  I need to speak only with a person who issues the 1099-R for account holders.   I received, incorrectly,, a 1099-R showing $136,067.50 a distribution for tax reporting.  When in fact no $ funds where distributed in that amount.  I simply had Cytometix issue a stock certificate equal to the number of shares of Cytometix stock that Millennium Trust had been holding in my account.  So no transaction took place.  Once Cytometix company advised Millennium Trust that that had issued a stock certificate to me, my account was then closed. I need Millennium Trust tax / accounting department to send a new ""corrected"" or reverse the 1099-R for no distribution of funds took place.  Instead at my request, Cytometix company contacted Millennial Trust to let it know that they were issuing a stock certificate for the amount of my share holding.   So no 1099-R is required since no transaction or funds distribution took place through Millennium Trust.   I am holding the stock certificate that was issued by Cytometix.  Unfortunately there is no market for selling my shares, which make them actually worthless.I did also receive 1099-R for cash, $236.36, that was in my Millennial Account.  When I closed my account Millennium Trust sent me a check for   $236.36.  The 1099-R is correct."

NICHOLAS DYKES,It has been a very hard and confusing process just to get my account roll over processed.  I was told different things by different representatives and have had several go backs.

DERRICK RUDOLPH,Millennium Trust truly acts as a partner in managing your retirement funds. Easy to use online services and great customer service when speaking with their knowledgeable agents.
GENEVIEVE KIRBY,Millennium Trust was consistent in tracking me down after move after move. Online process was fast and secure. I would definitely use them in the future. My experience was short but 5 stars all the way for my interactions and needs.

CA MARCIALES,They were always attentive. Fast to answers. All questions answered with no rush. Helped me out through my application process. Thanks
Chris Webster,"The login screen and ""which portal to choose"" experience is one of my worst ever. Some serious coding problems when it comes to login, and login recovery. Definitely not friendly."
Andreas,The phone numbers provided on the website and in their emails aren't functioning. The website is difficult to navigate. I haven't been able to speak to an actual human regarding my account YET so I'm not even sure I made the correct selections. NONE of this does ANYTHING to instill trust at all.
AL,The representative helped me understand how the money I had invested rolled over into an IRA that I never even knew existed. I was grateful to have spoken with someone so knowledgeable and honest. It was a pleasure.
Angela Africa,My representative stayed on the phone and walk me through the entire process. She was nice to talk to fill in the gaps while waiting for pages to load etc
ROY DANIELS,"For years I’ve trying to speak with someone at this company.  It was almost impossible.  Everything takes you back to a website.  I finally was able yo speak with someone after being on hold for a very long time.  Although I still had to go to the website, she was able to at least answer the general questions."
Jo Momma,"I tried t get a normal distribution via online, and received an error that said I had to contact a representative. After calling and finally getting rid of the robot, who did not want to contact a real person for me, I was told it would be a three hour wait. So I gave them my number and a woman did call me back later that afternoon. She sounded tired, but was able to help me get the form filled out (did not receive the error using my phone. The first time I was on my desktop). Then I was charged $25.00 for the process. Glad to be rid of Millennium trust. They took $35.00 each year as a ""Maintenance"" fee."
PHILLIP ROBEY,"The representative who assisted me was very professional while still being human! He helped me with the issue quickly and effectively, expanded the conversation beyond my initial request, and ensured that everything I needed and even issues I hadn't thought of, was addressed.

ctax,"Super frustrated that I didn't know you took over my Rollover. No letter received but thanks so much for charging me monthly so I am down more than $40 in 3 months. Horrible customer service. All the rep said was you should have received a letter. BUT I DIDN'T. And since you KNOW I hadn't logged on, maybe follow up."
Erica Carnahan,Wasn't happy I was charged to close my account.
Britain Reynolds,"I was about contacted  by your service  in over a year after my 403b was  transferred.

Cecelia McGovern,Transaction was easy and smooth. I am now awaiting the arrival my distribution thru a VISA debit card.
MELISSA TURNER,"My prior employer transferred my IRA to Millenium without my knowledge.  The Millenium staff was very good with helping me understand how that happened and what my options are.  Millenium also had some website glitches at this time, but those I talked to helped with workarounds.  So in spite of frustration with my prior employer, an all around good experience with Millenium."
B.,"Excellent work. Fast, easy, zero complaints from me.  Cashed out and directly deposited sooner than expected."
DYLON,"I never authorized this account, it was automatically rolled over to them from an old employer even though I never received any type of communication in the mail about my 401K closing/being rolled over. This company made it SO hard to get my money, I finally was able to do it online but I'm not even sure if I did it right since I never got a hold of their customer service, and no one emailed me back. THey charge SO many hidden fees, to open the account, to close one, to have it annually, insane. it is MY MONEY. Will be putting it in a savings from now on, I no longer trust any 401K or IRA companies thanks to this one. Terrible."

Elijah Swartz,This was a quick and painless transition. Thank you
Lisa McGehee-Rabey,"I would like to say Lawrence was extremely professional. I called already hostile, and he alleviated that hostility and provided exceptional customer service. Y'all should probably give him a raise or move him up."
Rosetta F.,I did not give my employer permission to move my 401k to millennium trust.It is disgusting that both companies are willing to steal money from hard working people.

Jason,Really great customer service explained very all i needed to fo to withdraw
GUSTAVO ROMERO,Poor communication.  WHen my 401K rolled over to you I was never sent anything.  I had to track you down with information from Fidelity.  I asked that my money be transferred to Washington Trust and so far it has taken two months.  You NEED to do better!!
Wendy Hall,I get to talk with a very kind and patient person. Thank you so much

Debra Birns,"Millennium Trust, tracked me down after I was laid off from a job in the year of 2019. Millennium Trust found me in January of 2022. And explained where my 401K had turned into an IRA. After logging on to the website and having the option of cashing out my IRA. The money was deposited into my account the next day. Was so happy because all the business that I do with big Corporations, Millennium Trust was the only Corporation that was honest. I will be investing with Millennium Trust in the future. Thank you"
Alexis,It was nice experience
VIVIAN HARDY,Millennium Trust was easy to access when I left my previous employer and my pension was swept to an account with them. They did a great job of informing me of my options and were swift to action when I made my decision.
KAREN DOMINY,"I did not choose you! My old employer did. When he gave you my money, I had over $1000.oo. Now you took over 2 hundred dollars from me. I expected mu retirement to grow not get smaller and smaller."
N/A,Too long to register my account. It loads and keeps loading. Website does not work.
Dg,Always hard to get connected with service line. Recent attempts all failed.
Leroy Jackson,The customer service representative was very friendly and helpful.  Josh
BRYANT NOLASCO,Funds came instantly. Thank you for the great service.
Lindsey Hall,"Tried calling the phone service and the only part that worked was the Spanish side on the touchtone options. Asked them about it in an email and did not receive an answer as to why. Also, had to just early withdraw my account because of not being able to roll it into my current employer's account. No one wanted to help at this company."
Nathan Rakita,"Joanna from the Chicago offices was extremely helpful and professional. She also was very patient as I needed way more handholding than someone my age should. The website is pretty streamlined, I’d like to compliment whoever works on it. And Joanna is just wonderful, she deserves a big raise!"
MONICA SAWYER,Besides being on hold for 1hour and 57 minutes awaiting transfer to another department. Which no one picked up. Plus having to figure out the online application process to withdraw my own $$$$. I'm appreciative that the $35.00 fee was waived. Just wanna suggest that a over the phone process should be used to help those that are technologically challenged and/or not computer savvy.
WRH,Very nice young man helping me but then the call was dropped so don't know if everything was taken care of.
Gisselle,Horrible experience with trying to get my IRAs transferred to another company so hopefully it gets done and completed within the 9 business days as promised
Timothy Schroeter,"The Operator was very knowledgeable, very polite, and extremely helpful; she even stayed with me on the phone call and she walked me through the entire process. I really appreciate her expertise and you need more people like her working for you!!!!!!! People like her are very rare and hard to find; she's a keeper. Thanks a whole lot. Please give her a big promotion for me.Reginald Gatling"
Bev,"This company deducted $30 initially from my account when my previous employer, who I had been getting correspondence from through the years, sent this account to this Trust Company. Then this company charged another $10 to refund money owed to me."
CLAIRE FISHER,My first 2 calls were a waste of my time and those that I spoke to.  3rd call gave me info I needed to get the process I needed done

Rosalie Haro,Helpful and knowledgeable customer service agents
MOISES LOMBERA,"Once I got someone on the phone, they were very helpful. Thank you!"
Sheila Baker,The process was quick and easy.  Got my deposit very quickly and no hidden charges.
AYO ALAKA-BRIGHT,"The reason I closed the account was because of all of the service fees attached with the account. How can you justify charging me to hold my money? I had well over $200 in my account when my account was handed over to you and by the time I checked again and withdrew you took more than your share of MY money that I busted my ass for. So much for the word ""trust""."
GABRIEL OCAMPO,My former employer sent my funds to them and I still haven't been able to excess the portal to view my funds. Called 3 times already.
DIANE REEDER,thank you for your service.
REFUGIO GODINEZ,The process was trouble free and money was transfered in a reasonable time.
SURETTA GREENE,I just wish i had a response to my request sooner instead of having to wait for someone to tell me i can get money thats already mine.
Lou Perez,"I spoke to the most polite, mist kind, most patient, most helpful agent anyone would dream of. Talking to customer service is always frustrating. You really cannot expect much but this call totally changes my impression. She made me want to be nicer. I can’t be happier having someone like her to help me."
H. HUANG,Wonderful. Thank you.
Joseph Kuefner,Everything was fine.  Thanks.
LANIESHA LAMBERT,"I was forced into thier services by my POS former employer. They charge me to keep my money, charge for a paper statement and charge you to withdrawl it. You cant win, theyre just takers."
Steve Chapple,Helped out alot 5*
Crystal Jimenez,Fantastic customer service!!! Fast and efficient!!!
BENJAMIN SWANUM,Ridiculously hard to communicate with. System glitches make it impossible to self-service.
Jessi,Great! They walked me through the process answered all my questions and stayed on the phone till I completed the forms.
Dana,This company lacks a user-friendly customer interface both on-line and for live-person interaction.  No correspondence was sent to me to indicate a locked account and that some type of personal contact was necessary.  I found this out after 2.5 hours online trying to login with passwords and usernames and then a 35 minute wait online. Finally the agent was helpful and provided the information needed and also informed me of service charges being reversed.  In an age of virtual connectivity they have an opportunity to improve their image and customer service and I hope this helps that endeavor.
SANDRA Baker,It was I couldn’t even get anyone on the phone and I still have yet to receive my withdraw from your  company it’s been close to over a week.

JM,"Hi, My experience was exceptional! I just got off the phone with Kavarsha D. in Chicago Customer Service. I called in with questions regarding my IRA. Kavarsha answered all my questions, was patient and product knowledgeable, and very welcoming. She walked me through each step and provided service with a ""smile"" in her voice. She made what could have been a confusing situation more like a walk in the park! I felt like she really wanted to help me have a wonderful experience and outcome  . . .a big YES to both!! What a fabulous representative for Millennium Trust! Thank you Kavarsha D.   : )"

Stephanie,"Using Millennium was easy, I would recommend to  others"

FRANCISCO E UMANZOR REYES,"I called on Wednesday morning at 09:15 (+/-). I was greeted by Carla who listened to my need, then directed me to Louis. Carla and Louis were very helpful. Louis listened, answered questions, and provided me the assistance I needed to receive a distribution. He offered to stay on the line while I went to the website. The website was user friendly. I completed the process by 09:35. Thank you for making this process quick and painless. I know the real pain will be next year when I have to pay my taxes on the distribution! Thank you, Millennium Trust! You've been great!"
William Ni,I appreciate you guys for taking care of business all in 1 day!!!!! Thanks

MARIAN GERGES,"Was on hold for awhile, then was told there was a flag on my account and tonhold while it was cleared. I ended up being transferred to someone else who gave me the exact same information."
PAMELA BROWN,You have to jump through hoop after hoop to get your money after waiting on hold on the phone you get told to do it online which is fine until you receive error messages prompting you to call again and wait on hold for another 20  plus minutes to just get told that their programs don’t communicate with safari well… then to find a friend to use their computer instead of your own iPad or iPhone just to be told you have to print off more paper work and turn that in by mail before they will process your request don’t waste your time with this company i would not recommend them to anyone if you ever want to see your money it’s a joke

Amarilis Tavarez,Easy transaction. Thank you!

JT,ive been trying to withdrawal money from a traditional ira for 3 days now and at first my account kept on freezing as i was trying to verify my phone number. then i couldnt get through to anyone on the phone. the automated responses dont reconize anything i say and twice it just hung up on me. terrible service
Terrel Ellison,I’m mad because your group couldn’t care less about the people who have to use this company.
JASON,"Millennium Trust enrolled me in paper statements then charged me 10 dollars for ONE mailing.   I asked to be taken off of paper statements.  Was told they would not do that without ME opening on online account and changing to paperless that way.  AFTER opening online account, read in fine print that a 25 dollar fee will apply to creating an online account???!!!!.  Either way, 10 and 25 dollars were taken out of my account just for having an account with this company."
FERMIN ESCAMILLA,"Website is easily navigable, however it does not work with Safari, only Google Chrome. Customer service representative was helpful and the wait was about 15 minutes. I cannot leave a complete review at this time because I have just made contact with this company regarding my retirement."

TUNYA BYLES,Easy to go through
GReg HENTON,"When calling in to learn about processes such as depositing new checks into my account, and the requirements to withdrawal funds from my account, I was given false information multiple times. What should have been handled in 2 phone calls to the company, was more like 5 or 6. The staff is not trained and some are truly not professional. I spoke to one person who actually took their time to learn what needed to be done. I won’t be using this company again."
Kimberly Daugherty,I login to Millennium Trust with my user name / password and it appears to log me in then its asking me for for my user name  / password again and will not allow me to login. I am at a loss for words about my displeasure with the login process and have had someone try to help and they do not understand why it will not work for me because it works for them. I would prefer my money be transferred to my Vanguard account.
Cheyenne Davis,Very easy..Thanks
Tony Gillis,"When I called the customer service number I was on hold for awhile, however,  as I was connected,  the rep was so nice and very thorough in explaining my options.

Kudos to this company. Thank you!"

JOSHUA GONZALEZ,I called Millennium Trust to close my account which had the remnants of a 401k rollover. The representative was courteous and friendly and directed me to complete the process online. Because of the small amount I was advised to take a distribution.
JANET SPAIN,Tried to access my account on the website and the site froze. Called in and used the call back feature only to miss the call. Called again and tried to do the call back feature and never received a call. Poor service and I hope they improve on it.

Jan Howell ,"My previous employer rolled over 2 amounts of money and it was put into 2 accounts. Makes no sense to me, but thats how it shows up. I took out one account, but the other is still there. Once the money from the first account hit my bank I tried to take out the remaining funds I had. I'm not able to do so because millennium trust says I have to have an active account. I don't want to have an active account with them. I just want to take my money out, but no one seems to be able to help. They just send me the instructions that I read up on before I emailed them for help. All I want is my money."
BARBARA FITZGIBBON,I still do not know where my money is being sent or when.   Will it be a check?  Will it go into my bank account directly?   Do you have my correct California and not Washington address?

I received a confirmation email and hopefully it will be just as easy to have my funds deposited in my bank account...... Jan. 25th--- Update! I have to say I'm quite impressed with how prompt my distribution was processed and how quickly funds were credited to my banking institution; 24 business hours to be precise. Remarkable customer service!! 👏👏👏 Thank you very much!"

COREANA GIAQUINTO,"I confess that I dreaded the thought of having to contact Millennium Trust to discuss assets that had been rolled over to them from a previous employer.  I knew nothing about Millennium Trust and so I wasn't sure how this would go.It turns out that what I needed to do was quite easy.  When I called it was Vicki from Chicago who answered, listened, and helped me to understand my options.  From there i was able to do exactly what Vicki said that I was able to do.I am very pleased with the results and with the service that I received from Vicki and Millennium Trust.Thank you!A Happy Customer!"

One day recently I decided to look into my funds only to find out I was being charged $40 annually for maintaining an open account with a very minimal return on my IRA that I lost about $200! To make things worse, the little money I had left was charged another $10 fee just to close the account."

Fix your system,The gentleman that helped me was great thank you
DOLORES VALLE,Easy and hassle free to operateon the portal!
Just Nina ,"Very helpful, considerate staff and the transactions posted quickly."
TIMOTHY KELLEHER,"One of the most expensive rip off financial companies I have ever encountered.  Your fees are ridiculous.  You make your website so cryptic and information unavailable.  Try to reach a live person for help is a joke.  So glad to have removed our funds from your company.Update 1/21/2022: I received your reply to my review.  Thank you.  I see you acknowledged you have fees associated with each account.  What you failed to acknowledge is how ridiculously high the fees are in comparison to other companies.  Not to mention how difficult you make it to request a disbursement.  We did not choose you...our previous employer did.  Thus, the ""benefit"" was to you for being able to bleed your clients account with such high fees.  Again, I am GLAD to have removed our funds from your company to a new funds manager."
Cindya Carrozza,"Millennium Trust has always been thorough, efficient and courteous with any and all interactions. I highly recommend them for any of your financial needs."
ERIN V,"Phone service people were unable to identify funds coming into their company for an extended period of time. Multiple calls back and interaction from 401k administrator involved finally identified the funds. 10 days after transfer was made to Millenium, a form was mailed to me at mercy of the US mail. Registered for online account which took days to be available. I am moving monies before I get same lack of timeliness and knowledge on day to day investing.UPDATE: I received a call from Millenium and individual was truly concerned about the comments I left behind. He explained Millenium's process to use these comments to improve. Frankly it was impressive and took the edge off of my feelings on Millenium. I answer all surveys I am asked to complete- good or bad. I did not know companies followed up on bad surveys- good for Millenium as that is how a company gets better."
JOSE RIVERA,Excellent customer service! Highly recommend!
DAVID HEBERT,The representative I spoke with over the phone was extremely helpful and patient.

SHAZIA AZGHAR,Website was straightforward and easy to use 😊
ASHIF JUMA,I was able to withdraw my funds online. it's pretty quick n easy.
Rino Reyes,Too much documentation via email to receive my money.
Joanne Danaher,I have no feelings bad or good for Millennium Trust. An old employer made a profit sharing contribution to an old account and somehow Millennium trust got the money.  I closed my Millennium within a few weeks of opening so I could put that profit sharing into my current 401K account.
JEROME LEONCE,My tiny IRA was rolled over to Millenium Trust from an old job. When I got the information to check the account I was disappointed to see the huge fees being charged to maintain the account. The fees were so large that the amount in the account was actually shrinking.
JENELLE KAMIENSKI,Easy to work with and answered all my questions.
RUTH MARTIN,Account creation and its association to another fund created in Millennium Trust was quite easy.
HEIDI MAY,Pleased how representative guided men thru steps. Big Thanks to Pauline.  Thanks again

DIANE ROSSI MACKAY,I loved it - it was fast and easy to get my money.  They make it very user friendly!
DUANGDAO KEIR,The website doesn’t work correctly. Can’t get thru to a representative. On hold times are ridiculously long. Representatives do not have the tools or knowledge to help. Took three days to just get my account number. Also this company makes it difficult to transfer OUT your money to another company.
Ser Vang,The online feature is very easy to maneuver through. The service is quick and painless.
Savannah Beard,"My interaction with Millennium was on point and very positive. i was nit sure who I was working with at first, howevere the security measures in placed allowed my interaction to flow smoothly.  thanks again"
MATTHEW QUEZADA,Friendly service. quick response. Issue resolved..
WENIFRED FASONG,"The lady I spoke to on the phone basically had me fill out the forms myself to withdraw my funds from my 401k that got transfered to your company. She was rude and had me on mute and whenever I asked a question she would respond as you see on your screen. She was being very snarky. Aside from that, although I've submitted all the information your company asked for, I have not received the transfer to my bank account as requested. It has been over 2 weeks now. I would like a status update but whenever I've called no one was there to answer my call and was on hold for a long extended time."
LAUREL VICUNA-HERNANDEZ,The site was very easy to use.  Transactions were seamless.
BOB GILBERT,It was easy and efficient
AMBIORY ALMONTE,Great 5 star. I had no problem or issues with anything. Thanks again.
PEGGY OROSCO,"The last two times I used the service it worked great. Don't know yet how today's will work, great I suspect. I pulled money the first time to pay off all my bills. The second time was just to make sure I had enough. This time it was just because I needed to make a withdrawal."
Altaf Ahmed,"Awesome customer service, super easy early withdraw process online!"
GEOFFREY HARCOURT,"My experience with Millennium Trust has been horrid from my first experience about 8 years ago. While trying to claim the funds today, It took over 2.5 hours and 3 phone calls over a 4 hours period, doing the same stuff over and over and over. Finally, I had to start all over again after 2 hours of frustration to do it ""manually."" The website kept glitching out at different points. It's like the computer programmers never tested the system. I froze while trying to ""verify"" my email, spun for 5 minutes only to be told ""we're busy today. Try back again later."" So when I came back later. Then it kept hanging up while trying to verify my phone. Incredibly frustrating!I was told that Google Chrome or Safari would fix the problem onlly to have BOTH search engines give me a blank page--worse than the firefox that I was working on. If you have software that only works on certain search engines, it would be SMART to disclose that to your customers to save their time and  your employees time. I STRONGLY DO NOT RECOMMEND recommend Millennium Trust to anyone."
JUDI REEVES,The site malfunctuons a lot! One issue was when i was trying to log in to a resumed document it would load on its own non stop to staying on the questions page. One day it was slowly loading so i managed to type in my answers before loading and it took. Stuff was easy when it worked. Spoke with 2 people on issues i thought they seemed helpful but did not get me where i needed. Finally got an email that got what eaxctly what i needed so easily.
DEBORAH  T,Phone prompts got me to a live person in a couple of minutes. From that moment on the representative guided me threw all the steps and waited to confirm desired final result.Good fellings through out entire interaction
SHIRLEY MARTIN,She was really nice and helpful made it really easy to understand what to do
APRIL,"Customer service was great. I gave millennium trust a bad review because they changed my previous employer's 403b into a traditional IRA, not a rollover IRA. Therefore, I was unable to roll it over into my new employer's retirement account; this obviously cost me a lot of money in penalties and taxes."
SALOMON LAZO,Helpful and expedient. Highly recommend.
Orlando Escolar,Received my money quickly and the customer service reps were very helpful.

ROBERT GEVING,"My representative was Chevon (I'm so sorry if i spelt that wrong)She was sooo helpful and kind. She answered each question I had, and made sure I was prepared to move forward with what I needed."
Rachel S.,"THE WORST company I've ever dealt with in my life. It took EIGHT FACKING WEEKS to cash out my 401k, and the majority of verification questions were related to my mom's ex husband from 20 years ago, because we had the same last name in the 90s. When I brought this up to a rep because I literally COULD NOT ANSWER MY OWN BXLLSH!T FACKING SECURITY QUESTIONS, I was very snidely dismissed. And NOW, its taking literal weeks for the tax form I need! You'd be better off burning your money or shoving it up Jeffrey Epstein's @sshole than trusting this company at all, ever."
Larry Alexander,"Can’t get access to account, says their system is down."
UZIEL DIXON,"the man I spoke to was very helpful and understanding ya see i am not very good with computers he help me from start to finnish,,,,, very happy for the help and direction so thank you   markst"

Dee,"While setting up my account for me to be able to view, I ran into an issue it was so simple. The woman that answered the phone was so PATIENT with me talking me through each step and stayed on with me until I was done the whole process. I so mad I can’t remember her name. You know sometimes a lot of times customer service is the worst and that call was the last call of me taking care of business before getting ready to fix lunch for my daycare kids and that call caused them to have the best lunch 😊. I really hope that Patience that’s what I’m naming the woman that helped me that day that she has a chance to read this about how just the tone in her  voice and not making someone feel stupid about not being able to figure out filling out forms via web goes a long way. Again Patience thank you so much for making that day easy for me."

michelle Hilpert,Has been impossible logging into my account since my account was rolled over to Millennium Trust Company. Don't know how long it will take for this to be fixed.
Deanne Anderson,They took money that did not belong to them. They took “fees” from me in order for me to just get back part of what they were holding against my will. I will never willingly do business with this shady company. Their website was deliberately murky and hard to navigate and their agent was profoundly unhelpful.
HARVEY DEIHL,My retirement fund was transferred from TIAA without my notice. I called TIAA and they referred me to Millennium Trust. I called Millennium Trust agent who directed me to create an account to be able to access my fund. Great customer service. Keep up

ButchC,Transactions are hard to complete with poor communication on how to do them.
ANGELA THOMPSON,Great customer service. Knowledgeable and my wait time was less than 2 mi minutes!
LIZBETH MIRANDA,The worst.  Systems are antiquated.  Extremely difficult to process transfers out.  Does not participate in any of the financial institution electronic transfer systems which makes transfers very difficult.  Will only mail checks unless you pay a $30 wire transfer fee.  This is a process apparently designed to make it extremely difficult to transfer funds from Millennium to a major funds manager.MY SUGGESTION IS TO NEVER USE MILLENNIUM TRUST!
RUSSELL ROWLANDS,Dealt with them on their website to withdraw. Was easy enough that I didn't need help. Thanks
Smooth,"Transfer of assets to another company was requested in mid-December 2021. The documents were ""not received"" and has not been processed as of mid-January 2022."

I'm in the process of moving my entire Millennium Trust account to combine with another IRA and wanted to complete this before the end of Januar.  The person was very nice however told me they could not provide me with this information over the phone. They told me I would have to wait for the document being sent by Millennium around Jan. 26th. They also suggested I provide my financial planner with my close statement as of 12/31/2021 and he should be able to determine the RMD.
DAVE WILSON,"Not a welcome feeling! The acct rep that I spoke to on the phone showed very little patience to explain things to me.

Samuel Cardona,Still haven't received any explanation to where my funds are. Thanks.
RASHID JAVED,"For a first time user of Millennium Trust's website and contact information, expect poor information and guidelines, error prone pages that don't execute as described, and very long delays on its direct call lines.  Don't try calling later in the day.  Call first thing in the morning and pay attention to Central Time, the open for business timeframe is not that wide."
Katherine,The lady I spoke with was very helpful and easy to talk to.
DEBORA SEWELL,"I am not yet finished doing business with you because I am still waiting for my check which I intend to rollover to my current retirement plan with T.

Zaccary Evans,Dolores and Davina were an extreme help during a stressful time. I did not authorize my previous employer to rollover my plan to this company and needed assistance to correct the issue as best as I can to have a direct rollover. Dolores listened to my concerns and connected me to Davina for further assistance of what steps to complete to make this change happen. I appreciate both of these ladies for taking the time to fully listen to my concerns and providing guidance that lead to my ultimate goal of moving my plan to my new employee with little to no hassle.
LINDA FLANNERY,"Your entire business structure is unethical. The account disclosures were never sent to me indicating that you would be assessing fees to my IRA account. You have neglected to comply with the The Truth in Savings Act. Furthermore, your practice for an online portal to view your account neglects the consumer the right to opt-out any fees in order to view their account information in accordance with the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act. Your company charged me fees without my consent and it is against the financial institution's act. Out of the $90 plus the closure fee that you are assessing to me you only return $40. This is called theft."

David RILEY,"I had to speak with a few different people to get my issue handled.  3 of the people I spoke with were totally awesome.  Bent over backwards.  The other two, lets just say I would never allow them to be part of my customer service team.  My situation was sadly an emergency situation and I still have not gotten a response."
ROBERT PREHER,Never have logged in on first try.Always have to call and get special link.They have nice list of availble investments.
CRYSTAL HUNTER,"This was my second experience working with MT. I wish I remember the name of the women who I worked with but she was based in PA.

It would be great if Millennium would send me infomation about my account.  Of course Millennium Trust could mail my information to my home address, which you should have on file.  ( 1973 Poplar Ridge)"

While trying to distribute the funds for my use, I ran into a little hick-up on the the website.  The customer service agent I spoke with was very helpful and professional.  She even emailed me some ""back up"" forms I could fill out send in if I continued to have problems on the website so I wouldn't have to call back just to get the same forms.  Only problem I have with the company is the automated assistant you get when you first call in does not give you a lot of options and really tries to keep redirecting you away from talking to a real person.  Just say ""Agent"" twice and you will get to talk to a real person, but I found it insulting when the automated assistant told me it was ""Safer"" to speak to it than a real person... implies they have mistrustful employess, not a good message to send."
Miranda Sparks,Should make it simply easier for individuals to attain their fines as a livid too complicated person student had to go to all of the necessary checkpoints to change your mind if I

Deborah Robichaud,Fast and prompt
Patrick Reed,"I switched employers and my 401k needed to be transferred to my new company.

STEVEN LAGARDE,"Your fees and policies are a nightmare and anyone that does business with you is obviously getting con'd in some way. Fees to close out your account, what kind of illegal is that? This account was not even opened with my knowledge, it was transferred from a company I used to work for with a 401k I didn't even realize I had.... so for me to come to the realization I had money just sitting in an account and on top of it you (they) are going to take some out just so I can get said money is complete bullshark to me.Your reply missed my point, I was unaware an account was opened in my name and if it was up to me, I would not have obviously opened the account. The complaint is with your closing the account policy in it's entirety, especially for those employees in my exact situation. Maybe you'll consider a change in your ""fees"" not to jip people out of what's rightfully theirs."

DEON MILLER,your company just steals money from people. and your customer service rep is awful and sounds like she hates life.
JODIE JONES,David helped me through my distribution.  Very easy
JERRY SCHIMPF,"Once I got past the MT automated answering, actual agent/person service has been good.  Automated system is not setup for new users or persons without an account. I was even hung up on by the system at one point even though I requested an agent/operator.  Getting an account setup/access takes days not hours with their system."

JEFFREY WEBB,"customer service representative was AWESOME !  Look, I've NEVER stayed at a facility (Respiratory Therapist) more than 3 years; I was always chasing new technologies or specific physicians that were progressive in treatment. I tell you this because I have zero experience with pension funds. I'm no fool, I know the basics but have not actively contributed ti any fund at any hospital Your representative answered my questions and expressed patience. Knowledgeable and engaging, those are key to good customer service. I would have given 5 stars BUT....the fees for such a small amount of money were exorbitant. To close, from the contact I made with Millenium on Monday morning, January 3rd 2022 until this morning, 01/05/22 the ACH deposit with my funds has been deposited and is pending due to banks not being open at 0430.  Thank You ** Especially the person I communicated with ! )Respectfully,John"

Also was quick to deposit for our use . Thank you to all who helped ..
JESSE BARTEE,Gaining access to online portal for rollover IRA was very difficult. Customer Service Rep Dawn however was very helpful in getting us online access.
COURTNEY TINNIN,Jennifer was very professional from the time she picked up the phone until the business transaction was completed.I found her very sensitive and engaging the entire time.Most of all Jennifer had lots of patience with me trying to type my information into the system(I'm 64 years old).At my age we aren't the fastest in inputting information into systems.Jennifer I just want to say Thank you.You made my day

Hernandez Parker,"Quick, east and friendly."
Cher Quarles,"Every step of using the website is bad. I still haven't even been able to access my account. The fees are ridiculous, to the point where it's literally cheaper to take the penalty for cashing out of my IRA early, even with a fee just for closing my account.Oh, and I never agreed to have an account with millennium trust. That's right, millennium trust is charging me to close an account I never agreed to open.UPDATE 1: since I can't just reply, here's my response to the ""Reply from Millennium Trust"":Regarding ""When the account gets rolled over and it moves into an IRA, it’s the individual who is responsible for the maintenance of the account."": I have no idea why you're putting this on me. How can you hold me responsible for an account you don't allow me to control?Regarding ""if you would like to further discuss fees on your account"", what is to discuss? You charged me to close my account. Your ""fee disclosure"" was quite clear about this fact. Even before then, you somehow managed to have about 10% of my money vanish before I withdrew I even saw the account. If you ever return this money, I'll update this review to reflect that you eventually did so.To anyone reading this, if you are reading this, Millennium Trust has not done so yet.UPDATE 2: ""Frank"", a manager from Millennium Trust, has now left messages for me twice and still has not left a callback number. He said on January 12 that the fees would be reversed. As of January 18, no fees have been reversed.UPDATE 3 (March 21): Millennium Trust has reversed the majority of the fees they charged. Thank you to Trustpilot for making some accountability possible."

JULIE MCCORMACK,Easy company to navigate.  All my needs were met.
POLLY WILLIS,"I had money left in my company 401k account after I retired that I was unaware of, you folks were charged with administering that money by AEP for me. You folks handled that transaction very professionally, thank you"
SKYE YODER,"Staff were very helpful with my questions, providing me with answers and solutions. Thank You."
MEGAN GAINEY,"I felt as if your agents was not helpful to me during my entire dealings with each and everyone one of then. Especially,  Tim from your Pittsburgh, Pa. office. This agent seem to string me along, instead of making my transition from MILLENNIUM TRUST COMPANY back to FIDELITY. Your company needs to have a sensitive training course, especially when you are dealing with someone Retirement benifits, instead of legal rhetric and a condensing undertone. I hope that your company would change how you will deal with your clients in the immediate future. I cannot see myself recommend your company to anyone in this world in the near future."
Mark Nolen,"Great customer service with friendly ,helpful phone agents!Easy to use website --when you get to the right one sent via link ! Otherwise main one is confusing and not user friendly Unimpressed by ""gains"" .. might as well stick your money under your mattress and save on yearly fees at that rate imo **not going to increase your retirement funds by enough to matter unfortunately"

SUMANA RAMAYANAM,Helpful staff member was extremely polite.
JEANIE CLERICO,"The operator  I talked with was willing to assist me with my issue and also had no problem when it turned out my mother also needed the same kind of help. She walked me through the process of resolving my issue, including finding an alternative method to resolve it. When my mother asked for help she also advised her on how she can find her account so that they could help her later."
REBECCA CASTILLO,Staff was very helpful. It was nice to speak with an actual person and not having to waite
E. Rogers,Thank you for finding me and making sure I didn’t forget about my 401k!
Nah,"Millennium Trust became the caretaker of a small 403B account that I had through a former employer. I hoped that I could basically allow it to sit and earn interest until I could withdraw it without a penalty. The problem is that they literally did nothing with it and never contacted me. The account not only gained NO interest over about five years, it also actually decreased in value. I just withdrew my funds and closed my account."
TUONG NGUYEN,"The employee was rushed and rude. She did not listen to the questions being asked and often talked over this writer when clarifying questions were asked. The employee was not clear regarding her instructions often referencing more than one process at a time. The employee made disparaging comments regarding the other financial institutions process without having full knowledge of the situation. This writer had to ask for a manager in order to obtain information which this writer was not connected to at all. The employee eventually did give this writer some of the information requested after supposedly speaking to the manager. This writer still has not access to the website and no ability to get the information required to set up a transfer of funds. I am disgusted with the customer service provided by this company,"
Mellaniece Jackson,wait for 20 mins on hold for a response from inpatient customer service representative. Same as other people's reviews.
Keondray Simmons,"She called & was pleasant. I still don't know anymore now than before because I told her I have no knowledge of what to do with this account. It says; restricted for trading. It's ok. It will probably just sit there because it's not a lot and I don't need it right now.  I have no idea who to ask what I can do with it. ***UPDATEAlmost immediately after posting the above review, I received another call from Frank, a manager with Millennium Trust. He was professional and pleasant with specific helpful information that gave me direction as to where I could get help with my funds. I now have a starting point. Thank you, Frank. Your call was greatly appreciated and I feel valued as a customer.Again, thank you."

After 20 seconds explaining my situation, I was transferred and then put on hold again. 10 minutes later, that rep returned to me (thank you for that, hence 2 stars and not 1) to indicate the new line was not being answered. He said they would call me back. Over a week later, no call back."

Mark Castaneda,I have to thank you guys this loan was an emergency and you guys got it to me at the right time!!!
Chris Clement,"Little more than a scam.I was in TIAA due to a brief employment and accumulated a small sum.After a few years, the employer transferred my account to Millennium Trust. Fortunately I called immediately and found I was now going to be hit with fees that would drain my account to zero.  However getting my money from Millennium Trust is a monumental task, indeed, a long journey I have not yet completed."

MEB,Asked for password update 3 hrs ago still have not received anything but trust pilot email. Well that’s a half of a day wasted .
Ryan Banes,401K transferred here 12/15/21 without my notification (prior company closed accounts). Have received no information from Millennium before today so had to call to find out about my account. I don't trust a company when the agent tells me only Chrome browser works to get thru the account setup so I can see my money. Chrome is frequently hacked and even yesterday was on the news with another hack. I was able to use Safari without any issues.
Yolanda Dobbins,10/10 great experience
DENISE LOCKE,Call in and The Agent I talked to was super professional and friendly.
John Leuchtman,"I was having a problem accessing my account and contacted Millenium by phone. Paulina walked me through every step of trying to correct the problem, but the problem persisted. She then contacted her I.T. people to correct a problem on their end and called me back shortly thereafter to walk me through the fix. Everything is working perfectly now. Thanks Paulina! and Millenium!"

RHONDA,Easy to access account. Website is user friendly.
JANELLE HUMPHREY,A good place to watch the money you earned die and help pay for someone’s third yacht
Tori-Lyn Berens,"Very unhelpful/rude customer service!A previous employer had put thousands of dollars of money that I had invested into my retirement into APB Retirement. A month ago APB transferred my money to Millennium Trust without any notification to me. There was no warning that this would take place. They just withdrew the money out of my account. I spent almost 2 weeks trying to track down where the money was. When someone FINALLY got back to me and let me know it was at Millennium Trust, I contacted them (Millennium Trust). They stated they sent me a ""welcome package"" which was NEVER received. I'm currently trying to figure out how to move my money out of Millennium Trust and close the account. The customer service agent was extremely rude and unhelpful. Unbelievably horrible and sketchy experience with all companies involved. I will be reporting this to the federal SCC."
ERIC S.,"My information was transferred to this company sometime along in the last two years. I did not know the account had been transferred until February 2021. I contacted the company and found that nothing has been done with the funds.  It is a cash account and has only garnered interest in the time it has been in their hands. I have not received any communication from Millennium Trust since they took over the account. Once I received the information to create an online account, I find the fees are excessive and are charged annually, or when when a transaction occurs. This means that Millennium Trust gets more of my funds than the interest being garnered. It is a no win situation in which I will be transferring my funds from Millennium soon."
NATASHA WRIGHT,Efficient curteous informative
JOSE GONZALEZ,My account had been transferred from another investment firm to Millennium. I had so much apprehension because it had been so long that I check on them at retirement account. Would they believe me? Would they treat me skepticism? Would they be difficult? The operator/ receptionist was welcoming. I breathed a sigh of relief but was still cautious about procedures and red tape. She then transferred the call to an “agent”. His name was Bruce. To this day I can’t believe the hospitality I was given. The service was so fast. Genuine. My funds were in my bank account an hour later. Amazing. Incredible.
Trevor Buckson,I was told there was money in my name from a previous company I had worked for and they put that money into Millennium Trust. When I got ahold of a representative from millennium trust they helped me very quickly with all the information I needed to provided them and the information that they had for me and I was able to get my money in less then a week! Thank you for the amazing service millennium Trust!
CYNTHIA CLARK,Good service !Please keep it up !
DAVID UNDERWOOD,I have no complaint with the company The customer service was very helpful and very nice and helpful
Justin Welch,The woman who assisted me(wish I had caught her name) deserves a raise as she has the patience of a sand sculptor during a tornado.
Stanley Kurunwune,"Broken Website. The website is broken, the chat is fully automated and unhelpful, the phone support sent me back to the broken website. :|"
RICHARD DRAYTON,"The agent talked to fast on the phone and when I politely asked her to repeat and slow down, she continued to speak and not listening to a word I said- continued to speak and when I asked her again she just kept talking and not paying any attention to me!!! I would give this agent a 0 star but it's not letting me- she was from Nebraska"
KAREN HEID,The website was very easy to use I had no problems whatsoever there you
Sam,"Excellent customer service. Carolina was very friendly, patient and helpful in helping me find what I was looking for."
WILLIAM SCARBROUGH,Good service. The rep was patient and knowledgeable.
JOHN LUNCEFORD,"A former employer removed one of my retirement accounts from TIAA and sent it to Millennium Trust. I never wanted to do business with Millennium Trust but they had my money so I had no choice. Attempting to set up their account has been a month-long nightmare that still hasn't resolved itself; they requested that I mail a form and copies of documents to them, which I did, but they pretended to have never receive in the mail. They don't publish their toll-free number and the representatives who call you on request are not helpful. My money is being held hostage by Millennium Trust. Now I have been forced to wage a months-long battle against them to get my money out of this sketchy and untrustworthy company.UPDATE: On January 7th, Millennium's nameless truspilot hack responded to my negative comment with this statement: ""I see you spoke with Terri, one of our Sr. Specialists on 1/3/22 and she assisted you with completing your online agreement."" This is nothing but a bold-faced lie. First of all, Millennium Trust claims I spoke with a female representative named Terri on 1/3/22. I spoke with a male representative. Second, Millennium Trust falsely claims that in this conversation, she assisted me with completing my online agreement. Again, this is a lie - the man (not a woman named Terri) who I spoke with simply made excuses, holding fast to the claim that I would NOT have access to my account because the information I mailed to them had not been received three weeks after I mailed it to them. Lies and poor record-keeping. Millennium Trust is a company with serious problems. It's January 7th and Millennium Trust is still holding my money hostage with their lies, excuses, and delays."
Upset Millennium Trust User,It's always simple to do what I need to online. Info needed is always readily available. I appreciate the service!
KALESE SARGEANT,"Very helpful staff, very quick processing"
Jacqueline Pinto,Unable to login to account. Tried resetting password and not working
COLIN NICHOLL,"I was not aware that I had any money in a 401K when I worked with Intuit.  I received a letter indicating that my distribution had been transferred to Millennium.  Once I contacted Millennium, it was a fast process.  After my account was verified or confirmed, my distribution was deposited in my account via direct deposit in less than one day.  I experienced exemplary customer service, and I am very happy with the way my distribution was handled!  I am a Happy Camper!"

AZ RV owner,I got my funds in the time that was given and it was easy to request!

CHAYA Villarreal,Had to call for some help registering my account. The lady that helped me was great. Took her time answering all my questions. If everyone else is going to be like her this will a be a good place for my money.
WANDA FORD,A lot of administration fees.  My rating (1 star) says it all.
Remy Kavukcu,Very interesting7B
V Says,"Simply wanted to rollover my millennium account into my current 403b but millennium made it more complicated then necessary. All papers that we were told we needed were completed &?submitted, then weeks later we were asked to do another. All done, but then only option given was to have a check mailed to our home, despite having all of my current fund info that could’ve been electronically sent directly. Just more delays. Frustrating, unacceptable.  Everything should be done electronically."
EDWIN BLACK,Very helpful person when I talked with a customer representative.Setting up my account was confusing. I twice (Aug 21 and Nov 21) got a message saying that my account was not processed. Finally called in Dec 21 and was able to get things set up.
JUSTIN HAWLEY,Pauline was very helpful and patient. It was a much easier experience than when I called a few years ago.
JERRY L LEMBACH,From the day my money was invested with Millinium Trust I saw an increase in funds every day. I wish I could continue to use them with the new company I am with or if they would mimic what Millinium Trust is doing it would make me sleep good at night
BRUCE TIMM,Great problem solving skills were provided as well as customer service.
Toni,I was impressed with how fast they took care of my situation.
JustAnswer Customer,"The company creates unnecessary barriers and processes to maximize fees. I had an undesired account created by a former employer. MT charged $25 to get the account, $25 to close the account. They won't release your account number until make you jump through multiple hoops. I'm expecting another $25 charge for the privilege of waiting for MT to complete a transaction. This is a scam company designed to harm low income investors with predatory processes and fees. Avoid at all costs."
ASHLEY SZELAGOWSKI,"Not familiar with Millennium Trust but once I got acquainted, I was able to get done what I needed and completed the tasks. The representative was helpful too."

VALERIE WHITE,The best customer care experience I've ever had she needs a raise!!!!!!!!!
CRISTINA V,Although I am closing my account I was very pleased with the process. It was easy yet very secure. My identity was checked at each step. The process was not intrusive. The only complaint I have is that there are not more options for transferring funds. I would have liked to be able to transfer directly to my daughter's account. A small complaint!
KPadden,"Too many fees, not easy to transfer"
Stephani Ravenel,The process of working with this company was very smooth and efficient
Kenneth,"The website was hard to use and not easy to do simple things. For example, seeing multiple accounts on my page and roll over IRAs. For the multiple accounts it was not explained that they had to be added separately despite them both being in my name. Overall, very frustrating to use."

LUIS ARMIJO GONZALEZ,"I do not have enough experience navigating your website to give any exemplary knowledge of good, bad or otherwise...so when I have a problem, I call. Problem solved...great service...I will be calling again soon to ask a few questions...and I know I will have answers.Mike A. Shriver"

DAVID RUSNESS,Working with millennium trust was efficient and easy to navigate. I had a 401K that had been sitting in an account for a number of years.  With one simple transaction I was able to get that money managed and and it was a really positive experience. it only took about 15 minutes.
Donna Mitchell,"CapitalOne has informed me in November that they will stop providing retirement plan services and will move my money to this Millenium Trust Company UNLESS I transfer my IRA to some other financial institution myself.So I have requested my IRA account to be transferred to another bank by submitting transfer request through that bank. They sent the paperwork  once in November, but nothing was transferred. They resent it again in mid December, no action again.I am now seeing this is as a tacit agreement between CapitalOne and Millenium Trust to get hold of clients money against their wishes.I have now consulted my lawyer and he will be filing a lawsuit in case my IRA account is moved to Millenium Trust even though I requested it to be transferred to a different financial institution.And now I am finding out that Millenium Trust Company was a few years ago involved in a ponzi scheme with IRA accounts and there were class action law suits. This is a disaster.I am sending letters to the SEC and will raise this with my contacts in the media who will follow up on this and make it newsworthy. I am not letting you touch my money. Enough is enough."
VANESSA B,I love your customer service the gal who helped me is so nice and easy going keep up the fantastic work
RAUDYS BREA,Trust a company to deal with your money
JEFFREY H.,The rep was so amazing! She was extremely knowledgeable and did not make me feel silly for not knowing what I was doing. She stayed with me through the entire process instead of throwing info at me and moving on. I am so glad I encountered such a caring and fun spirited rep for this company!
KK,Representative was professional answered all my questions.
Ben Berger,"I have been trying to correct the fact my funds should have rolled to mass mutual back in April and instead were sent to you.  I have done the paperwork and it still has not been dine, why is it taking so long!"
Tareva Borges-Foster,Customer Service was very helpful and knowledgeable.
PAMELA NEIL,"I was told my funds were transferred from TIAA to Millennium. When I went to transfer the funds from Millennium to another IRA, the person said I didn't have an account nor any funds in it and told me to contact TIAA. TIAA told me they had sent the funds. I bounced back and forth between Millennium and TIAA and no one on either end could help me and told me to reach out to the other party for help. Each party told me it was the other party's fault. This went on for about 6 weeks until finally, someone at TIAA personally handled the situation. Finally, the funds appeared at Millennium and I was able to instigate a transfer of the funds. I STILL haven't gotten the funds transferred, but I am hopeful the process is underway.  In my opinion, after the second call to Millennium, they should have reached out to TIAA to find out what went wrong. This was exceptionally poor customer service that has kept my money out of market for 2 months now!"
Juliann Warnes Western Dental Patient,Very thorough and professional customer service.
PHILIP HANVY,"Thanks for assisting me with my account, knowledgable.."

RAYMOND BROOME,I never consented to have my money put into an account with Millennium.  And now I'm being charged fees for moving it to a bank of my choice. Trying to close the account with Millennium Trust has been one hassle after another.
DEVIN,"My 401k was transferred to Millenium by my former company, even though I requested a distribution. I received a welcome letter from Millenium. I pressed the link for the customer portal & have verify & reverify my information with no account information given. I went into the portal a few hours later & finally received my balance. I attempted to request a distribution & was told that there is NO MONEY AVAILABLE.  I have total lack of trust in this company & hope that I will eventually get my money. This is extremely disturbing. Not professional money management."
MICHAEL DIRUSCIO,Easy transaction.
JENNA MCGARR,"The chat was ok. Downfall of the chat is that it was just for general questions. I was told by someone on my last call that I needed to set up a new user ID which was not what I needed to do so I had to call. Wish I could've been helped in the chat but the lady I talked to was very kind, patient and helpful. I appreciated that she was willing to stay on the phone with me if I wanted."
Chris Massimi,Terrible to work with and didn’t consent for them to hold my money.

Dwight Flegel,The 👍 good news 🙌 do
Mattilyn Rasmusson,They may be great or whatever. I don’t really know. But my only experience with them is bad and their customer service rep Michele was rude as (kcuf) when I was trying to ask her questions so I understood what was going on with my account. I lost hundreds of dollars in my small retirement fund cause of the experience I had. I’m definitely not happy and I’ll definitely not recommend or be doing business with these people. It may be crappy of me. But first impressions are everything and Millennium Trust Company didn’t leave me with a smile on my face…. So take this review how you will. They asked for a survey. And I gave it to them. I actually told my partner when I hung up with the rep that she was lucky they didn’t ask me for one on the phone. Then I saw the email asking for one today….. I guess I’m still salty about everything.
KIMBERLY SWAIN,I was assisted immediately with my questions and the rep was very patient

JASON KULWICKI,The customer service representative we spoke to was very nice and explained every question we had. Navigating our online account is super easy as well.
AURA MIRANDA,"Thought it went very well. We (J&I) weren't 100% prepared for the meeting, but 90% at least. Things we talked about were in line with where we were thinking. Mostly I have quite a few 401K accounts hanging out there to likely consolidate, and some long term ones we've been in quite a while. Plus a few other maybe not the norm assets that we discussed. My wife was comfortable with the meeting, Dominic has some 'homework' for us with some things I'm still tracking down. Overall, I'm looking forward to his thoughts and ideas based on our discussion. I've dreaded and procrastinated doing this for a few years now, but they were highly recommended from a long friend of ours. So, we'll see what shakes out. It was definitely a worthwhile meeting."
KENDRA HALSELL,Customer service was very helpful and I had no problems. Thank you.
Barbara,Super difficult to transfer my money out of this company.
CHERYL BALDWIN-TAYLOR,I am very pleased with my experience with the Millennium Trust representative. He was very kind and considerate and I had a smooth transition reconnecting with my IRA.

SHANE DANIELSON,Agent was friendly and professional and quick.  Excellent

Anonymous,"401k  was transferred to this company. Chose to withdraw money seemed friendly and helpful was told would take 7 to 10 days. Money was transferred to a card on December 7th. Called today December 20th after not receiving anything was told it could take up to 15 business days, this was not what I was initially told. Company refused to give number of card service they transferred funds to , only that I would have to wait till the 27th."
Babam,"This is the 2nd time I’ve requested a dispersement, which should only take 5-10 business days and has taken 20+ days.  I will be pulling my remaining money at the start of the new year and will find another company."
Johnny,"The representative that assisted me was so very patient,  and extremely  helpful every step of the way. She was INCREDIBLE!!!!!! WHAT AN ASSET SHE IS TO YOUR COMPANY !!  I don't  remember her name though. I wouldn't  have been able to navigate through the portal by myself if it wasn't for her extreme patience. She is terrific."
RENEE,I did a withdraw online and access code given for tracking..The website is so darn hard to get to that process. You go through multiple screens but never to the one you need for 5h8s process..
None,Still not able to get on to the form to withdraw

Andrea Wilson,"I am trying to trans my funds to a different manager. I can not get anyone to help me get the account number that I need. I am not good with the computer and kept hitting road blocks and no one there was willing to help ""just go to the website"". I didn't choose this company and will never recommend it to anyone"
JESSICA DEROSE,I recently needed to rollover funds from Millennium to my company's 401(k).  The process was very simple and every was handled very efficiently and quickly.
Victor Blanco,I need help accessing my account. I misplaced my login information.  I sent a request for someone to help me find out where my money is.  I feel like someone is holding my money.
CARL MARTIN,It was great experience
Martin,Millennium Trust was very helpful by guiding me through the navigation of their website.  The customer Service was both professional and understanding ready to assist me with any questions and provide excellent responses and information for a really a great online experience.
JESSE SMITH,I found this platform friendly and easy to manage
Moose,I have tried to close my account it has been so difficult and impossible I simply just want to close the account and have my money sent out to my personal IRA or bank account I was lied to and stated that I could do it just simply going online and I haven’t been able to accomplish that as there’s no tab that state may close this account
BRANDON OLDRO,"Good service,  very professional and helpful, thank you for the support, Happy Holidays."

NORMA BURNETT,Nicole was extremely helpful and very friendly
LINDSEY WHEELER,"MT has a great customer service department!  They continued to contact me so that I could make decisions that could one day effect my family.

LISA REDWOOD-BURCH,I had to take money out of my IRA. The rep who helped me was polite and knowledgeable. Great communication.
RACHEL WHITE,"Initially paid $45 to move $157. Upon seeing my review, I was reimbursed $35 and only had to pay for account closure.  Appreciate them for reaching out and returning the excess funds."
MICHAEL B,The company is not proactive and does not provide much help in transfers. This is my first impression. Not easy to get an agent on the phone.
AMH,Through the process of doing my withdrawal and sign in issues. You were very helpful.
TABAKA OSONDUAGWUIKE,The process seems too slow and still paper based. My 401k was rolled over to the Millennium trust and it took a week just to setup the account with the customer service agents asking me to email them my SSN and giving the reasoning that their system still does not accept any electronic docs. Not sure why financial institutions do not understand how vulnerable to identity theft such transfer of confidential information is. The fee are high. I lost a sizeable amount of my 401k contributions to all the fees charged.
Paulo Zanardo,Great service and very respectful and responsive.
SHANIQUE SHELTON,"My modest 401k was rolled over automatically into Millennium Trust when I quit my job. After rollover fees, annual fees, pathetic interest, and more rollover fees to put it in my personal credit union, I have approximately 1/4 of what was originally put in an IRA with Millennium Trust.I am beyond livid. This bank is a scam."
Mohamed Iman,I’m not sure what the woman's name was that helped me but she was great stayed on phone with me to help me complete everything I needed to. She was very kind helpful and even though I had a lot of questions she did not mind answering them! Never gave me the feeling I was bothering or annoying her with all my questions wish I could remember her name but I’m pretty sure she was in NC.
Tim,The whole process of transferring my funds was wonderful
BRANDON M,"Greatly appreciate the fast response,  and timely manner,"
Brian Schutt,It was fast and easy. Can't beat that.
MARY HARRIS,Customer rep was very patient and kind to help. She was also very knowledgeable and helped me navigate the site. As far as the company Millennium goes. It’s been a read bad experience.
Grant Jones,I'm not happy about not getting my money right away why do we have to wait on our money it's ours not ur money
Charles Dilts,"Distributions should be done over the phone with an agent as well as on-line. Not everyone believes in using a computer for certain transactions, for multiple reasons. It’s frustrating to call for assistance and not get it. It feels like another cut in service and like I’m doing the agents job for them."
Hiram Rodriguez,The online services were easy to use. I was able to locate the tabs I needed.

PETER CLAIN,very quick to create an account and process what i needed. website modern and easy to navigate
Philip Ageh,Well I'm glad they were trying to verify that I was the owner of the account but they asked so many questions and I hadn't looked at the statement in months! So it was difficult to answer but i knew how much was in the account and how much I was transferring allowing more $ if needed for the service
Fee victim,No problems.  The app walked me through the task.

LAWRENCE MCEACHIN,I found the website difficult to use from the 'first time' login to the completion of forms.
SHANIAH ATHAY,Slow processes. Causing delays in accessing my own money. Wasn’t ever notified account was moved from one company to this one.
JOHN KLEIN,"The yearly service charge of $35 is causing a reevaluation of the need for multiple accounts and now consolidating and rolling over to my current employer. By bye Millennium Trust!! I will not be back, ever!!"
Anna Olshove,At first process seemed troublesome since it had to be done all online. But a quick follow up call with a rep helped me through it and got it moving. Thanks

Maggie,"Customer service was very helpful and the wait time wasn't very long even though they were busy. All my questions and concerns were answered and I was guided through some of the processes even though it wasn't necessary, it was extremely helpful 10/10 would recommend. Thank you 😁"

PHILLIP JACOBS,"Thus far, I am very satisfied with my experience with MTC. Each Client Experience Agents that I have spoken to (Ms. Bailey, Ms. Jackie and, the first agent- which I apologize for not having her name available) have been knowledgeable, informative, professional, helpful and friendly at the same time. It reflects the standards of those in higher management, too. Great job!"
LESLIE DOUGLAS,"My experience during this call far exceeded my expectations. Years ago I placed a call for assistance in setting my account up and that was the most unfriendly encounter I had experienced in banking/investment in all my experiences. Therefore I avoided having any concerns addressed via telephone as I felt certain I would be be placed in a conversation that led me to believe I was a total inconvenience.This most recent call, thanks to Christina M., Client Services I Retirement Services, was to polar opposite. After my telephone interaction years ago I called my employer associated with the account and shared my horrific experience. Today, I will be calling that same employer and letting them know what a friendly, most helpful and considerate experience I had. I will also follow that up with a letter to the company, Viacom/CBS Corporation.My recent experience with Christina made me feel valued, important and understood. Christina listened to my concerns, addressed them with courtesy and professionalism. Christina explained the new website, she further took the time to review what exactly I would be reading in the email that followed. Christina made a transaction that I have been putting off for years process flawlessly.The Millennium Trust website is now likely the most user friendly banking site I have used. It was easy to navigate, make changes and process the requests. Your website is a true added bonus to your investment platform.Thank you Christina M and Millennium for the years of watching over my IRA. If I ever have the opportunity to come back, I most certainly will."
ERIK MONTOYA,"I find it difficult to navigate your website. I consider myself reasonably computer literate, but I found your website to be confusing. Your decision tree matrix is hard to navigate."
steven moore,Customer service was very helpful...process was easy. Thank you
TRACY SCHLIEP,The process was very easy to follow even though I don't use computers that much.I was given pretty clear direction to follow and was given important information to read so I would be able to navigate through the process in the future.

JORGE BARRAGAN-MACIAS,"I am so sorry I forget the name of the lady that helped me, but she was fantastic! Super helpful, very kind, and very quick. No issues whatsoever. An employee you should be proud of."
ELIZABETH H,"Outside management fund transfer request to my main outside retirement account was rejected as my MT account was not ""Activated"".  Frustrating how difficult is was for me to get the MT account ""activated"".  It almost feels like Millennium Trust wanted to hold onto my money like it's their money and a small account can be quickly eaten up by the annual fee until my money actually is their money. (Bad on me for not following up in a timely manner after my MT account was finally ""activated"" to allow for that to happen.)  MT - enjoy my annual fee.  Sorry you won't get the rest.Update:  12/15/21 - Even though the account ""Close Fee"" was going to be waived as a courtesy with such a small balance, a $10 small account close fee was subtracted from my $22 transfer.  (I guess I could have left a penny to avoid the close fee.)  I did call to discuss.  MT is currently in the process of reimbursing the $10 fee.  Should be completed within 3 days.Customer support has generally been nice, courteous, and professional.  However, MT has their policies and procedures and as titled, rules are rules.  Suggest that if your company retirement funds get transferred to MT, get your MT account ""Activated"" and move the funds out ASAP to avoid the fees."
JASON WANG,No issues at all in making my account. Waiting to see how cashing my 401k out goes.  But so far a pleasant experience
Nate,"I have only had one interaction with MTC so far, since my previous employer's retirement plan moved to them. I called in to get info on my account since I knew nothing. The woman I spoke to was patient and cheerful and helpful - and my wait on the phone was brief! The website is easy to navigate, and the option of paperless statements was made available right away. No complaints so far."
Mekkah Abdul-Khaliq,They worked very fast to answer my questions and were very helpful
TRACEY YEAGER,I needed to withdraw some money from my account & I was able to to do this without any hassle after filling out some forms. I received the money the following week. I appreciate how easy this process was.

Suzie Momrik,Excellent service! Really appreciate the way my case was handled with professionalism and empathy!
Maria Dedvukaj,"The process was really easy;however, I wish that it would be totally clear the total amount that I would be receiving. If there was a way to let you know the total deposit after taxes and fees. The deposit amount was a little confusing"
NAHOM KIFLE,"Not much to say except that the process of using your platform was very easy. Along with that, my money came to my account in a flash. I do have chime which speeds things up a little bit but that makes me know that within 24hrs of my request being processed, my payment was authorized and sent my way. You won my vote."
BARBARA,"Online form very easy to use, liked the fact that I didn't have to send a voided check to get direct deposite to my bank"
ROB,the process seems fine. what i don't understand is it takes milliseconds for MIllennium Trust to obtain one's funds from a prior 401K.  Upon completing the process to get a check from Millenium Trust I'm sitting on over a week.
Dean Zanedis,"I thought that this change over from company's would be a real pain, but the people and website was very easy to manage."
Daniel Ozanne,My account was transferred to Millennium Trust from another servicer. I had to pay a fee to close a Millennium Trust account that I never agreed to open in the first place.
DAMIEN,Unfortunately Millenium Trust was given my investments by mistake of the previous carrier. The only problem I had concerning Millenium Trust was not being able to access my account number without opening up an account causing my funds to be delayed in delivery to the correct  company. I do realize your commitment to keeping personal information secure and appreciate it. I apologize for your being placed in this awkward position by the previous holder of my account. As of yet I have not received my funds to be released to PNB and hope to have the transition completed very soon. Thank you for help in this matter.
VALERIE SCHALTER,Total waste.  Spent 2 years with my money just sitting there while the market skyrocketed  while you charged me fees each year so I was in theory losing money.  I actually took my money out and am willing to incur the fees rather than have sit here doing nothing for me.
FLORENE KENNEDY,I never received the promised invitation!
G.White,"I wanted to transfer funds to my bank. It took me some time to sign in by creating my account first, but once fully verified, which was reassuringly thorough, every step was easy and quick. Though I was advised the transaction may require a day or two once completed, I immediately logged in to my bank and the funds were already pending. Thank you. Nice doing business with you."
WALT F,"Lost my account number,   Staffer was very helpful in retrieving it."
Christopher Buckles,"Had a phone call to have information regarding access to my account. Jackie had a terrible attitude and did not help at all. If anything, she talked down like i was an idiot. As my first experience with Millenium Trust, it showed me it's unprofessionalism."
Michelle Cole,It’s too confusing to figure out how I’m supposed to get my money.
DANIELLE IVEY,Tim did a great job of helping me figure out my error in logging into my account. Took about 5-7 min and I was good to go.

Cassie  Olson,Trisha did an outstanding job of helping me with my concerns getting online and active.
MICHAEL HAYWARD,I don’t like the recorded message system that kept looping around even though I asked to speak to representative.
CINDY CANTARANO,Scam.  Hit me with tons of fees at the end of the relationship.
Bonnie Jenkins,The website was easy and self explanatory
JULIO,Your website is a nightmare I will be making my third attempt to activate the card I'm beginning to think that this is just a bunch of b***$*!it and I will be unable to do it and I will not be able to get my money
JOSEPH CLARK,Only worked with MT a short while but my interface with them was always very professional and clear that they valued me as a client even with only a relative small amount of money involved.
CARLOS REYES,Won't stop bugging me for a review. You get 1 star.
Vanessa,"Both times I’ve called, I’ve gotten a lot of help. Thank you so much! They will walk you through something if you don’t know what you are doing. Also very patient."
Tom,It was a very good experience I had a little problems at first but that was because I’m not computer smart but we got the money already so we appreciate all the hard work you guys done

Shawanda Davis,"Very frustrating process to transfer account to a different provider. It has taken multiple phone calls, website searching, and paperwork submission. Each time I talk with someone they seem to have a different idea of how Millenium Trust can process transfers."
NACHHATER SINGH,They were very helpful thanks for everything
Stonium,Very helpful indeed.. responded to every email sent with promptness and guided me thru the registration process.
JULIAN JOHNSON,I was very grateful for the information that was shared with me. My questions were very basic. I was not familiar with the services that were offered to me. I still have more to read so that I may know what to expect when I transfer money into other accounts.
PHAT TRAN,It’s really hard to navigate around on their site
Accidental Customer,Site is very easy to navigate. Top Notch
Melony Madsen,They are a good company and know what theoff year doing.
Mary Vandagriff,"My funds were transferred from T Rose Price on 11/10/2021 via electronic transfer and for several weeks no one was able to locate the funds. I called countless times to both companies and went online but neither of you had record of the funds until 12/6/2021they suddenly appeared without any explanation to me. That's unacceptable and doesn't instill a lot of confidence in either firm. Now I find out that each of you automatically took out annual maintenance fees, them as it left and you the first day it arrived even though I never wanted you to handle my funds. In a month's time, I have paid a few of $120 in combination and I have had no say. This may be normal business practice to you but it's unfair to the client, especially the client that didn't ask to be a client and one that has been served so poorly over the last couple weeks."
ANDREW COUFAL,Excellent customer service Their customer service phone calls 5minute waiting time very fast with this pandemic right now and they are straightforward very helpful and very satisfied with the service.
Roseann Farinacci,"As a first-time user, I was having trouble accessing my account. I called 877-682-4727 and a very kind and patient person named Bruce listened carefully and walked me through everything very deftly. Thank you for not making me feel stupid. :-)"
GG,This was an easy transaction thanks
Smith,"If I could give them a half star or less I would do so. Once my money was established in an account with MT, I was locked out for over a week from doing anything with it. They said it was due to an address change but even after that was addressed I was still locked out. I asked to get escalated to a manager to have it unlocked and the common response even from them was give it a couple hours. Another response was that I could move my money out. They failed from an IT, managerial, and customer support perspective. I would think twice about trusting my money with this company."
Douglas Myers ,Easy process. Representative that I spoke to was very helpful.
VALENTIN GARCIA,Website was straightforward and quite navigable.
MATT P,"I signed onto their website for the first time in order to take a distribution for a retirement account that has been forgotten for years.  They made it quick and easy, the money was in my bank account within 20 minutes and they took the taxes out for me before distributing. Great service!"
EDWARD BERNARDO,"It's hard to actually speak with someone with questions you may have and the website is not user friendly...for Example..If you do not remember your log in or password, where is the link for help? Or redirecting where to go to find it?Not user friendly at all. Especially for clients who are new to the site."
TERRELL SMITH,"Quick, easy and trustworthy."

I am very pleased with the service they provided!"

Christopher Simmons,"Zahide went beyond my expectations. She really took the time to listen and sort out my problem, and she did.  It took us some time, but she guided me through and even waited on the phone for me to do all the steps. I really appreciate her diligence and dedication."
ROBERT NOWLEN,Scam .. a 200$ rollover gets him with 35$ setup fee and 25$ to close it. Banksters without a conscience
BlueCollar,Good company
Dorie,"people were nice, still jumping through loops trying to get my moneyTOTALY SUCKS"
ELIZABETH,Good help thanks
QUANEISHA HILL,"Terrible platform and slow platform, absurd trading fees. They do have a friendly customer service team but not helpful. I really wish I moved my 401k from my old employer before it transferred to millineum trust. Prior to 2020 didn’t even have an online investment platform and had to call in to make a trade. I’m happy to take the penalty fees to withdraw my money so I never have to deal with millineum trust again. I would like to see commission free trading, a more intuitive and easier to use platform. There are so many other options that I would recommend over millineum trust"
ANNETTE NELSON,The lady I talked to on the phone was very patient and knew how to help me.  I was able to get all the information that I needed.  Please thank her for me.
Karen Corey,Phone agent was able to answer my inquiry and set expectations when my case would be resolved.

NICHOLAS URSINI,It was super easy to get my money. It was deposited into my bank quickly as well.
BERLINDA BENITEZ,I needed to move my money fast and though the website seemed difficult to manage and navigate I called customer service and they walked me through it. Very happy with their service and would definitely recommend them again.
Millennium trust customer,"Millennium provides very little, if any service, and only serves as a ""middleman"" for an alternative investment that is necessitated by law. And then charges what I consider to be an exorbitant fee for doing so. I'm sorry I ever went with them, but it's not worth it now to try and find another vehicle. Do yourself a favor and shop around before engaging them."
David L.,Everyone I spoke to was courteous and helpful.  I appreciated the fact that I didn't have to go through a complicated password ritual to identify myself.
ERMA MARZAN,"I sent you forms for an RMD distribution. I didn't hear anything so I called, after I repeatedly tried to do it on line, which never worked. Three times and the ""robot"" hung up on me twice, after I asked for a representative. Finally, the woman who answered told me I hadn't sent any identification. I said yes I did. And if I hadn't, Why didn't they Tell me!! After holding again, she found it then told me it was a temporary license and they couldn't use it. Retailers accept it, Police accept it! Finally she said that she ""thought"" it was ok. It was going to take awhile to get the distribution because they had to sell the stock and then issue me a check. I'm still really ticked off at your whole system and its complete lack of function. I'm still not sure I'll get my distribution at all, let alone before the end of the year. I hope so."
CECILIA HARRIS,"I received a letter about some past employer having switched investors and letting me know I would have options with money I didn't even know was available. Although the letter included instructions that were perhaps outdated or typed incorrectly, once I emailed Millennium Trust directly, they promptly sent a helpful email with working links. The distribution ""wizard"" process was very transparent and straight-forward - the highest marks available in my vocabulary. The process walked me through step-by-step without wasting a second of my time. I really appreciate the level of care and professionalism I have seen in my brief contact with Millennium Trust and I will feel confident about any future accounts I may entrust to them."
MICHAEL LINCOLN,I like the speedy process. No unnecessary questions
JUDITH BLOCHINGER,Great experience
PIA LEE,Web site was easy to use and information was well displayed!

RYAN FRANK,Wonderful customer service. Thank you
THEODORE HEDGLEN,"I am new to Millennium Trust and I wanted to set up my on line account.  I was having a rough time, so called for help.  Stephanie was extremely patient and helpful in getting my account set up.  Many thanks for a great job Thanks William Graham"
Stacey Chapman,"I am more or less satisfied with the phone call information provided by the representative.This is my first time talking to Millennium about my IRA because the Co. I had worked with transfer my IRA funds to Millennium. There are questions and details that the representative could not answer, as I had to fill all the required information to open/confirm an account with Millennium ( which I did). Will discuss further with my financial advisor who manages my IRA account (in a different Bank)."
ABDY JALILVAND,"Waited a long time to speak to someone, but had the option to leave my number for a call back. Had the time so decided to wait and be sure. Got treated very well and accomplished everything I needed to"

Ian,The people I spoke with were very knowledgeable and professional.
CHELSEA SANCHEZ,"Rather than earning money, my retirement account lost about 9%.  This is in large part because of the excessive charges for ""taking care"" of my account, however, I don't see where any care was given other than regularly taking money out for Millennium.  I also do not appreciate that I have to give you permission to my personal information because I want to make potential clients aware of Millennium's malpractice.  As a matter of fact you do not have permission to send me anything or give out my information outside of what I am publishing in this box. DO NOT CALL ME, GIVE OUT MY PHONE NUMBER OR EMAIL INFO TO ANYONE.  I am on the National Do Not Call List. Thank you.  Do not contact me with newsletters or helpful hints.  This is the end of our relationship. Thank you."
MICHELLE NEWNHAM,I was not helped with the questions I had about using the app. The gentleman on the phone actually hung up on me.

Peter Santaniello,"I never Recieved a ""welcome"" email that told me where my money went or giving me options to choose how to invest or cash out. Very sketchy company. Was upset that my former employer chose to roll our 401 k funds to this company. I DO NOT TRUST THEM AND HAVE NO ACCESS TO MY MONEY!!!! THEY ROBBED ME! If you are legit I should get a response if not you are crooks."
ANDY JOHNSON,It was an excellent experience working with your personnel. The were extremely helpful  and expedited the process to receive my funds. Thank you!

DarleneRiddley,"Website was awful Agent was great.As an individual with a rolled over IRA account, I found the website difficult to navigate and nearly impossible to find any helpful information when I had trouble with a form. I tried the chat feature and found that to be completely useless. Once I found the phone number to call, the automated recording was obnoxious and very unhelpful. I was finally connected with a live agent who was wonderful. I can't think of her name now (Starts with an M from the Chicago branch) but she was very pleasant to speak with. She was quickly able to answer my questions and resolve the issue I had. Thanks M!"
Julio Arceo,This site is the worse to navigate through!!!
TERRY BUCKMORE,Millennium Trust representative was very courteous and helpful with getting me logged into my account!

Racquel,There was some confusion on the form I completed for a withdrawal and when I called the customer service line she was so helpful and informative and even taught me the differences between my accounts. I appreciated her service.
EDWARD THOMPSON,"MAC'S online site is confusing.  There is incomplete information pertaining to current statements, very little useful for  online RMD info, and I had to jump from screen to screen to find,  unsuccessfully I should add, useful information.  Trying to speak with a live contact was an effort.  Among my multiple calls, online searches, and directions from several individuals, I accomplished very little.  I was obviously frustrated, but at least one agent did not listen to what I was saying...they insisted on emailing me the RMD for even though I told him/her that I had completed the forms and needed help finding the most expeditious way to send it.  My lateness in requesting the RMD was exacerbated by the fact I had no meaningful written communications about or from MTC nor the former employer which transferred my account.I apologize for venting, but over the past few weeks I have tried to open account access, was told MTC would send me an email explaining my next steps about a week ago, and had to start all over today."
Irma Melendez,Called the support agent who is very friendly and helpful.

I tried logging in to my old MT account and saw only a zero balance, and I tried setting up a new account and the site said I couldn't because I already had an account.  Then when my financial advisor and I called to get my account information, the woman helping us was rude and talked over us. It has been a truly terrible experience all around."

JEFFREY BAER,"The customer service was not bad when I called and actually spoke with someone. But the online system is not user friendly and it made it very hard to know whether or not what I was asking for was being accurately processed, and the process has taken a lot longer than was told multiple times. Would be difficult to choose them again should I ever open another account unless their system changes."

EMILY BLANKENSTEIN,The customer service was helpful. I had to call because the website was not easy to navigate and left me with questions. My questions could have been answered by more information in the windows.
LORI BARR,You partner with these companies and take people's money moving around without their permission or consent and then when requested to put the money back you forced him to jump through all these hoops and create all these accounts in order to even be able to look where access their money even though you were moving around without any of that same process before in order for them just to get it back you need to refine your process and streamline the ability for people to access their money and make sure that you were notifying people in advance before you start moving things around and allow it for a better system and process transfer or rollover money even with needing to be accountable to the i r s
Michael Furminger,Thank you for your assistance.
TL Parsons,"They gave me a tracking number for a large withdrawal from Millennium to my bank I had made, but there was absolute nowhere to enter that information to check on it. I was in the dark for a week and a half before the deposit hit my primary account."
Tyler H,My account was affected with an former employer and I had a hard time figuring out how to either combine the retirement account or cash it out.  I absolutely no assistance from my former employer or your company.  If someone is holding my money I expect some sort of customer service.  I will never use this company in the future.
SCOTT QUICK,"When a previous employer finally shut down operations my 401k was sent to Millennium trust. 5 and half months later no further contact. I did get a welcome letter, but no further contact.  All this time the funds have just been in cash.  I think better marketing or calls might have given Millennium trust an opportunity to manage this account but it will be transferred shortly somewhere."
RICHARD DEVITO,It was easy to sign up and then make a withdrawal from my account.
Lezley,The phone representative was knowledgeable and concise with his answers. Thank you.
SELENA CONTRERAS,Your online service for a senior citizen is very difficult to use
Kara Logwood,"Really disappointed with the service. The woman on the phone when I called was quite terse and unfriendly. The folks at TIAA and Vanguard are helpful and friendly when you call, so that’s a better option I think."

Drew Brown,"Great company.  Withdrawn the account for financial hardship reasons, and needed the money."

JILL KING Cyr,"I initially received notification in the mail from Millennium Trust circa 2019 but I thought it was a hoax. Since, I have moved to another state. I received another notification in NOV 2021. I took a chance and made the call. SURPRISE, SURPRISE. No hoax. The representative explained it was my retirement holdings from a previous employer from 1991. The rep was fantastic (I forget her name). She provided the options of keeping my retirement money with their company, rolling over to a different company, or cashing out with a penalty of being under 59 1/2. Two days from the call was my birthday. I accepted the money as a happy birthday to me. The money was EFT into my account within the hour. And BONUS, she shared if I choose to go to Disney Land on my birthday, I will be treated as a princess of the day. 2022 Princess! I Millennium Trust for managing my money all those years and proactively seeking me out. Thank you."

Handy Customer,"The website is crap, very not user friendly and when I called the customer service for help the lady hung up the phone on me. she was rude and always had a decondesending tone of voice. To top it off this crap of company a TOOK MONEY THAT DID NOT BELONG TO THEM❗❗❗ I never signed anything approving of my money being touched by anyone ❗❗"
HANNAH MCNEIL,Money was transferred to their business helped me make a decision. Also transfer was super fast thanks!
Dorothy M Mcgee,"Representative was a bit condescending. Her tone seemed annoyed and she provided limited info and little options for my concern. This company earns money by taking on rollover accounts just to charge them money for no service at all. They make you pay to close your account when it is rolled over to them without your consent, plus an annual fee. They do little to manage your account, yet they charge like you are getting an actual service from them. There is no way around their frivolous fees. They are a predatory company that takes advantage of individuals. Talk about getting money for nothing."
DENISE KELLEY,Quick easy that is all I want to say.  Yes
Linda Zuckerman,I got charged so many fees it’s not even funny. My account was opened by mistake and only open for a week. They refused to budge off of “that’s not our problem” would never recommend
Tiffany,"Very professional, quick and easy process in helping me out wit my rollover."
MATTHEW CRIST,Knowledgeable and polite
Zoneisha Griffin,Got to WITHDRAW all of an amount in one day. Fast and easy service!
William Newhart,"Agents Good...Website BadI've had nothing but great CS when interacting with agents but always seem to have trouble with the website and trying to access information. Also, the phone IVR is annoying because it will not give you want but make you repeat several times that you want to talk with an Agent. Thank God for the great Agents."
JULIO E,Awesome would recommend them to anyone

JERRY LANDRY,"The gentlemen that I spoke with (I believe David was his name) was extremely helpful and patient. He answered all of my questions and was extremely kind.

SHAUNA MONKS,"I had a 401k from prior employer had moved over to Millennium.  The instructions I originally received for getting logged in were incorrect, and the error message I received was unclear.  I called for assistance, got someone quickly, she was very helpful, and all was resolved by the next day."
SONJA Farrell,"Unknown to me my retirement got transfered to Millennium, has been a pain in the neck since trying to even get my account set up to access my funds. Pathetic system they have, seek somewhere more user friendly to place your money!"
BRIANA DUARTE,Alicia was very nice and very helpful.  She went above and beyond to help me.
BRITTANNY GILPIN,"junk website, ridiculous fees"
Raphael Brown,"Your onboarding experience is shady. I basically uploaded an identity theft goldmine without two factor authentication, and the whole site seems very low quality.  I called and talked to someone for help to ensure I was not being scammed, and they just told me to use the site.  That sounds like a phishing experience.  I did some online searching and called another financial institution to ask about Millenium, they had never heard of Millenium.  All in all, had i not got mailers, called, etc, 0% chance I would have ever tried working with you.  The only reason I do, is bc my old institution sold you my 401k"
Pooja Shah,Got very good person on ph .. answer all my questions.
Wykame Jones,Try to call to get more information about why my rollover IRA was rejected and the customer service is no help as they say they don't do processing. All my correct info was labeled and still rejected and nobody can seem to assist.
Thomas Dierich,Very helpful and very prompt. What I experienced with them was professional and they made the process very simple.
F COOPER,"I recently received an email from Millennium Trust that both surprised and pleased me. It seems that they had an old 401 K account for me,  from a place I worked at for a couple of years in the late '80s ; 33 years ago !  The agent that I talked to was very helpful in providing me the steps I needed  to take to claim the money that was in my account.  While the amount involved was not very large (about $135.00) - it was still an unexpected bonus - as I am recently retired and disabled on a modest fixed income from Social Security.  I really appreciate the diligence and perseverance that Millennium Trust displayed in connecting me with my long forgotten funds - regardless of the relatively small dollar amount. Thank you Millennium Trust!"
MARTINA APILADO,Very easy to work with and navigate web site.
MICHAEL SANDEZ,I've never had any problems with the company. The one time I've had to call for assistance I found the representative friendly and helpful.

VALERIE FINCHER,Great experience! Most helpful🙂
Olutayo Ojo,Great job ! Keep up great work
SHAMEERA SHARPE,I had an account from a previous job I didn't know of. They informed me of the transfer to their care. When I decided to distribute the funds they were prompt and professional giving me the information in such a way it was easy to understand.
S. SHAY,"Karon was very helpful with resolving my logon problem as well as with a couple of account issues I was having.  While one item is still to be completed, I feel confident that it will be resolved by Millenium.I did think that the initial phone call wait time was rather long, especially when the ""answering system"" said my wait time was 2 minutes! It was close to 15 minutes!"
STEVEN ESPINOZA,Customer service provides information that I am inquiring. I am just not satisfied with the yearly fee that is being charged on my fixed retirement IRA.
Mohoganie,I seem to have gotten conflicting instructions on transferring an IRA to another company causing a delay for a month +.I'm still not sure what the status is for this effort.Is there more paperwork to redo?Has a check been cut? Is the check in the Mail? When can I expect it? Why can't the funds just be transferred directly to the new provider?

JOSEFELIX RAMOS,Easy and secured. Thanks
ALETHEA TENEYCK-SANDERS,"I found creating a login to be confusing and excessive. I got through the process far enough to create my own password but then I couldn't access my account. I had to call and have someone look into the issue and remove a hurdle that I did not know about. I was also appalled at the poor performance of my funds and lack of options to invest. I'll consider this a lesson learned that any large employer can choose a minimalist company to move 401k funds into. I'm beyond delighted to say my funds are being moved into my new 401k account, back with Fidelity."
CHARLES BOGGIO,It would have helped me if I were advised of where this account came from. It took some research to determine its origin. It also took much longer than it should to have this event completed.
SAMSON MURRAY,"Customer service was polite, efficient, and complete. I was completely satified by my phone conversation."
Joy H,"It's technology still needs to be improved as there are sometimes errors accessing to the accounts or updating profiles when you leave overseas like UK. But the Customer Service people are great, and they try to resolve your issue asap."
DI,"Simple process, and very responsive. Appreciate simplicity in this day and age. Thank you."
CG,"If your so concerned with a response, why do you have cookies attached to it.????? AND, I can’t post this unless I agree to the terms below. What a joke."
Dale,"Very detailed, predictive in what to expect from the next step of the agent. Worked very considerate to my hearing issue - never better service received in this regard."
B.G.,"Great communication, answered all my questions and transferred me to the correct department l."
Eileen Cappelletty,This process is quite literally pissing me off
Vanessa Anderson,"I was contacted by certified mail and signed for the envelope.  I did not know I had an account in my name.  The verification process was very long and detailed; but VERY necessary!  Employees were polite and took me through the process, explaining options as we went through each step."
NICK BREWBAKER,The representative was knowledgeable and precise with information.
customer,"I called for help filling out my distribution request form because, upon arrival in the snail mail, it appeared intimidating.  Alisha Washington was all in.  She began with, ""I can do these in my sleep.""  I knew I had reached the one that could put up with my self-doubt.  With the weight lifted from my shoulders and all my fears gone, we took off.  She walked me through each page, section by section, ensuring thoroughness and completeness.  Answering all my questions and finding the best solution for my needs; patient & kind - customer service from the good ole days - not like today's ""this is the way it is, take it or leave it"" attitude.  And I AM the definition of customer service - my 1st career was 20 yrs in retail management...up the ladder from a 12hr/wk part timer to a District Manager in 3yrs.  Alisha would be my right hand if she were working for me.I'm hoping she reads this herself because I know public praise is few and far between.  Thank you for giving me the opportunity to toot Alisha's horn.Sincerely & gratefully,Lissie Watts"
DANIEL MOLINA,Robin was super patient with me and funny too.
Primrose Johnson,"Wonderful, customer service"
TAMMY BRLETRICK,Delores was great.  Invested her time and experience to help me navigate my on line access and gave great advice on processing my investments.
Unsatisfied Customer,"I have been trying for weeks, if not months, to transfer a rollover IRA to another financial institution. I have never been able to access my account online and efforts to get help from support staff went nowhere. I was told repeatedly that I would receive an email from staff with instructions to set up my online account, but no email was ever sent. Meanwhile, I have been getting paper statements from the Company indicating that no investments of the IRA were ever made, so the account never produced any returns. All the company did was continue to charge me substantial annual account maintenance fees, which only had the effect of depleting the account by hundreds of dollars over time. After repeated attempts to get help, I finally got a representative to tell me that I did not need online access to close the account and that it all could be done intra-institutionally. Hopefully that is happening now, but I have every expectation that Millennium will create yet more roadblock to get in the way. Extremely disappointed and frustrated by the overall experience."
William HAMMOND,The agents were very informative and helpful.
CHRISTOPHER MURCHISON,"Very helpful, thanks!"
CAREN GUTHRIE,"Easy to use, amazingly quick service!"
Deredama Saga,Rep provided me with great service

Ms. Ragland,"Millennium Trust has excellent customer service. I was always helped thoroughly, they will even step by step walk you through whatever you're having issues with."
Mary Duncan Shouvlin,Well done by the team for I an all set. Thanks!
CHRISTOPHER BRADLEY,"They do cash sweeps where the use your money to make them money yet you dont see a penny. I saw where they used my money to buy a $1,000 worth of stock for a penny a stock and sold for 10 dollars a stock but i made 0.00 even though it was my money invested. Ive lost money because when i wanted to sell a stock the website was down. . . customer service is a joke💯 🤡 you have to call customer service just to withdrawl money and its on hold for 9 days. . they nickle and dimed my account down to nothing until i invested it myself. 10 years and nothing to show as far as a investment on their part."
Happy customer,Easy peasy website and quick to update info.   Good experience so far
Philip Taylor,My rollover agent (CS) FAX Submitted my rollover transfer paperwork three times to Millennium over a two month period. Was told never received.

CORTNEY,Executive who attended my request was very professional and helpful . My problem was resolved successfully. Thank you
Jerry,Awesome experience would change anything
DEBRA PEARSON,"The automated system is pretty useless and only irritates people dealing with it and having to provide information 3 times.The first guy I spoke to (I think his name was Troy, he had an India-sounding accent to his voice) wasn't helpful in the slightest and lead to more issues occurring.The second guy I talked to, Lawrence, was amazing!! He was very professional and definitely went above and beyond to help and was very easy to talk with.

JUAN MARTINEZ,"My IRA was transferred from a previous employer to millennium trust. I had since went back to school and forgotten about that IRA until I recently graduated college and found a job with benefits. When I went to roll over my IRA from millennium trust, I found out that I had to Start an account which would cost me (if I remember right) $45, and then I finally got logged in to find out It had been accruing fees for multiple years without notifying me at all. They took out over $300 of my hard earned money in fees. Rolling it over to the new employer was even a pain in the a*s. AND it involves a closing fee.  (They love to charge you)Make sure to click on the tab that says withdrawals"" instead of ""transfer out"". That should save you multiple phone calls and weeks of waiting for extra documentation that you dont actually need to arrive in the mail. I have absolutely nothing good to say about these thieves. Hopefully you can find a better company to invest your money with."

This was 6 weeks ago."
MICHAEL LATTARI,Great customer service and very knowledgeable of the system
BRIAN CLARK,"The person I talked to wouldn't listen to what I had to say and kept talking over me. She cited an email that was sent to me when the account was opened (6 yrs ago), which I wouldn't have any longer. She couldn't really answer my questions or direct me on the website. Disappointing."

Glenn,At first I puzzle why my check had not been posted to my account having been informed the check had been cashed - yet not posted - It took 2 calls back and forth.  Second time I called to give additional prove of canceled check  I was inforned the check had just been posted to my account  ( 2 days after first call) I promptly requested a transfer to my checking account and this was done on a timely fashion. Must admit I loss confidence in the company.  The 2 initial customer service representatives requested date of cancell check like if it had come from me not a rollover from Columbia University. 3rd time I was informed check had just been deposited on my account at which point I requested information as how to withdraw it. That was done in a timely and professional manner.

They transferred my account to Millennium Trust w/o proper notification. I then had to set-up my new account, just to turnaround and dissolve (close) it to acquire the funds. This process was immediately processed. I was able to obtain my funds within 24 hours. One highlight of M-Trust platform, was the option they gave me to withhold any federal and state taxes before they released my funds!! This allowed me to have a more accurate understanding or estimate of how much money I would actually be receiving AND eased my mind about paying taxes down the road. M-Trust is a great platform"

MAN ANGEL CHOY,"My experience with Millennium has been nothing short of brilliant. I lost track of a small investment rollover from a former employer and received a note indicating a need to contact Millenium Trust. I was very pleasantly walked thru the online login process and happily found my investment had been honestly nurtured over the years to a handy sum. Every time I contact their customer service, they have been very, very helpful. They have my complete thanks and endorsement."
HASAN SPARKS,"Multiple logon options are confusing.  Agent put me on hold twice without telling me she was going to.  No way to update beneficiary online.  Never received information from company when another company rolled over my 401k and haven't made a dime on $235,000 account in the last year while market has gone up drastically."

ADRIAN TAPIA,Very helpful answered my question quickly.
CHRISTOPHER GIBBS,I never wanted to come over to this company. When I called to get this transferred I had to set everything up just to send it over to somewhere else. Why a rep couldn’t just email me a statement is beyond me and bad customer service. Had to call back since I didn’t know what I was doing and I got a rep that was talking to me so unprofessional. Attitude and all. I will never recommend and I can’t move my accounts fast enough.
SUSAN MANSFIELD,Too many fees! This company will slowly suck away your funds with their fees.
Trace,"Prompt, courteous. Efficient."
Cynthia Coleman,I called and waited 2 months for some time of response. I called again and no proper information was given. I had to apply 6 times in order to process my request. After almost two months I am able to log into my account. Please get better customer service representative. It’s frustrating being put in mute when I’m talking and having to repeat my self. Also having someone who’s a smart ass on the phone doesn't help. I’m calling because I need assistance and you are being paid to provide that. It’s ridiculous.
CRAIG WILLIAMS,A former company I had worked for transferred my 401k to Millennium Trust. I had previously had an online account with Millennium Trust so my account needed to be updated and verified.

APRIL,"The agent was helpful and accomplished what I needed in an efficient manner.  Even called me back when we lost connection, to help me complete my access."

Leslie V.,Very easy site to navigate. Everything I needed was right at my fingertips and I was able to handle my requests pain-free and in less than 10 minutes.
Carolyn Holton,Called and customer service agent assisted me with logging in. Due last year when I called previous agent advised that I had no account. Turned I do have one. Today's agent (11-11-21) was very helpful and knowledgeable.
Juan Gonzalez,I contacted a customer support specialist to inquire how to confirm two accounts and how they can be combined. The specialist immediately sent an email with detailed instructions and answered my follow-up questions. The steps outline in the email we easy to follow to complete the IRA form.
TRUDY TILLER,Lots of fees. Horrible customer service. Bad website.
Richard,Well you we're supposed to refund my $35 back but that never happened. So if could've put zero stars.  I would've

Shanta,"I was surprised by being told my Paychex ira was ended and in 30 days it would be sent to Millennium Trust. I was helped by Judy, a wonderful patient easy-to-follow lead through the portals. The next day I needed to call back as the time passed for something to happen and got Judy again! Actually, the whole process was easy when you have careful directions and a guide taking you through all the steps. She knew all the places that one could get lost because I took all of them. She was awesome and so is Millennium Trust for having a very safe place for our little or big money to store."
MARIA SALTER,Each time I called I was given contradictory instructions I meticulously followed first set of instructions Then I was informed that my application was incomplete Then was asked to send in a direct deposit letter from the bank Called the representative she said that was not appropriate So difficult to get my own monies back !!!

TOMA WOO,"The distribution process is convoluted. Should have been a simple money transfer into my bank account but instead it's going through this stupid money card company. Still waiting for the card. It was advertised as 9 to 10 business day. That is two weeks. Still waiting,  three weeks"

Lawrence Conner,Everything I needed was quickly completed and everything went smoothly. Thank you.
EDWARD SMITH,They said they were going to send a welcome letter within 72 hours. It's been over a week. Having to do this all on line instead of over the phone is bull crap. The fact I'm being charged is also nonsense. Can't wait till I'm done with this company. Give me my lousy 2 k and let's be done!!
FELICIA ECKISS,"STEALING with loopholes...Awesome there is a real person on customer service!Since all they do is read a script and forward emails, maybe consider using an automated services and stop charging accounts HORIBLE fees for EVERYTHING!!!!!"
ELSIE LAU,Very helpful .. Thank You for your service..

ALEX MCLACHLAN,"I was informed by another company that my 401k trust funds had been transferred to Millennium Trust. I had to contact this company personally and have since learned my initial 401k funds had been reduced by half the total amount. In my opinion I would not ""trust"" this ""Trust"" company!!"
DEMITRIA COLLINS-LOVE,"Helpful, courteous, clear guidance and helped me with my question regarding my rollover accounts."
Dawnya,Customer service was professional and helpful
BRITTANY,"I needed to close out my small account. It was relatively quick and easy to do. The only reason I didn't give five stars is because that implies perfection.

DORINA TUCKER,I was not happy with this company at all. They took half of my money in fees alone. Very disappointed!

MP,The customer service staff helped with this transaction in professional manner and explained everything very well.
serione,"It was easy to set up an online account, and the interface is very user friendly."
DEBORAH GAMBLIN,"They’re a predatory financial company who holds funds most people probably don’t realize even exists, charging management fees and doing nothing with the money. I’d tell you to avoid this company at all costs, but their business model depends on you not knowing they’re holding your money in the first place."
MICHAEL NELSON,Awesome I’m grateful
James,Great customer service. Easy access to portal!!!

V.A.,Good work yall
VALERIE CANGRO,She lied and said i would still have access even though i closed the account.  now i am having issues accessing the account.
DIANE HARRIS,I 100% understand the need for security.One of my past employer moved my 401K to you.Not my choice not your fault.However you whole process seems to have a goal of making a person give up and lose the funds!orAt least pay fees they are not even aware of for years.
Rich,"Vicky provided excellent information, was clear, concise and explained things to me when I wasn't understanding the processes. Vicky was professional and straightforward, and worked with me till I could express understanding of what she was informing me of, in terms of my options, and what was required of me to complete to make the choices I wanted to make with my account. She sent me the information promised, immediately after our phone call ended. I would want to work with Vicky again if I had a need to."
MELISSA,My O'Reilly 401 was transfered to them without my knowledge after separation. They contacted me about about managing or withdrawing. I chose to withdraw and the talked me through the process. Professional and helpful. Had the amount been greater I would have been comfortable leaving it with them.
MICHAEL DAVINO,My funds were transferred here without my consent and then I was charged for claiming my money.
KEVIN LITTLE,"My retirement funds were “given” to this company without consultation or consent on my part. Although that is the fault of my former employer, Millennium withdrew funds for the privilege of taking my money and made the process of recovering my money complicated & arduous. The whole experience was unpleasant."
JOSE HERNANDEZ,"I found your website not user friendly—too many steps to get to what you’re searching for. I couldn’t easily find ‘print my statement’. I had to watch the video that did show how to get to my account statements. Too many steps involved.Also when setting up the accounts, it ask if you want paper or paperless. When choosing paper the site tells you there will be a fee, but it doesn’t tell you how much should you choose paper statements."
MICHAEL SETHNA,"Associate was very knowledgeable,patient and helpful."
Jennifer Clough,"Poor service. I went online 10/8/21 to initiate a distribution/rollover. Site issue- I set up my logon/password and when I tried to enter site, it wouldn't let me in. I had to call a rep.  She sent me a link to access the rollover form. I processed the form while on the phone with her, providing ALL info requested, and submitted it. Weeks later...no check. I called on 10/25/21 to inquire.  The first rep I got, put me on hold for 10 minutes then disconnected the call. I called back, the 2nd rep confirmed Millenium had all info needed and didn't know why the check was held up. She ""expedited"" the distribution. As of 11/6, still no check. Working with Millenium has been a hassle for something that should be quite straight forward."
Name DRE,Website is easy to use and associates are extremely helpful to meet my needs.
JONATHAN B,Fees fees & more fees. Unfortunately my ex employers sent my retirement money to this place. Before I even knew what happened I had already been hit with fees. They split my balance in two so trying yo move it out have to pay 2 different fees as well.
Jose Miranda,I spoke with a rep and asked for a form to be emailed to me to make a roll over from my Roth IRA he said he would take care of it right away when I open his email it was for a fee statement and not the form I needed! I called back an hour later waiting on the phone 32 minutes to be exact I left my number and asked for call back that took another half an hour finally the 2nd rep emailed the form I needed I really was disappointed today with Millennium I did spend over an hour and 2 phone calls to deal with one form! Feh. Poor use of my time today.
WILLIAM TUIDER,Only down fall issue when you call customer support they just referr you to the website
JERRY LARIVE,It sometimes was hard to change information- depended who I spoken with
Tp,Representative over the phone was very helpful.
Joyce Etheridge,"If you want or like your money being held hostage by ""a deliberate complicated website""....then you're in the right spot...horrible website functions design...so you can't resolve anything with your money; and it takes a day or two for someone to get back too you (if they do). So annoyed with this company...can't wait till I figure how to get my money out of this company."
EeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeL,This was the most grateful experience I've had fast and simple very helpful customer service keep up the good work
PAULA COMPTON,"After one month i had to get the other vendor on line and discussed where the check was.  You started with that the check had been return.  Merrill stated that the account number was on papier-mâché work, you stated that your system does not allow to place the number on the check so Merrill could not deposit the check.  All this took me calling many time to get straighten out. I was not impress on how your process worked."

LEE ELLIS,Excellent customer service. Excellent experience. Just follow the instructions that are provided to you and the experience will be great. Thank you for everything.
MARCAL MIMS,"I was sent a link to access my account and several times it wouldn't work.  I spoke with 3 people at the company and filled out a paper copy and was told if I scanned it and emailed it I could ask for it to be rushed.  That was not true.  It was 4 days before someone responded to tell me they couldn't open my attachment.  Then after I resent it, I waited another 3 days to access my account.

MARK SUTTON,Thought your website had the feeling of a scam so bad I almost reported it as fraud. Still might based on how difficult and unnavigable the whole experience was. I couldn’t get my money out of your company fast enough without feeling a creep factor on a scale of ten. I even contacted the company I am moving my money into to make sure it was secure. My advice is make your company more welcoming without creating a feeling of having your hands so deep in my pocket in a bad touch way. The bad touch includes all the “fees” as well.

This was fustrating. I will call tomorrow to straighten out. Calling has been a problem for me as I live in Tucson, Arizona and time differences are now 3 hours apart.

Diana  ,"I want to take a moment to sincerely acknowledge the superior customer service I received from one of your employees at Millennium Trust. Gwyn was by far the most helpful, knowledgeable, patient customer service representative of any company that I have had the pleasure of working within a very long time. Gwyn is an absolute breath of fresh air.Today was indeed a glimpse into what customer service used to be. Gwyn took the time to make sure my issue was resolved, even offering additional assistance should I need to speak with her in the future. At no point during our call did I feel rushed or as if my issue couldn't be fixed. Gwyn's professionalism and ability to get to the bottom of the situation was a lesson in customer service 101.Given today's climate, a little kindness goes a long way, and as much as this has exceeded my expectations, I feel that Gwyn's commitment to excellent customer service should be commended. I know that Gwyn's diligence and knowledge will continue to be an asset to Millennium Trust."

SHARON GRAY,"The time to begin processing an order is usually delayed beyond the standard processing time of 3 days. If you call and remind them they usually start working on it right away. The point is that one should not have to make a follow up call to ensure someone is working on an investment release. This issue has existed since 2019, well before CV-19. This is the only issue I have ever experienced with MTC. The people are good to work with so I get the sense this is a staffing issue. I believe all other areas are covered with good service and value."
Lee Johnson,Tried calling multiple times. Every time I was able to get through rather quickly but the people that I speak with don't really seem to be too enthused with providing assistance.

Billy Blair,I have poa on an a account that has been rolled over to them. I HATE dealing with this company!! They ask for documentation over and that I have already sent in. They lose the documents that you sent in. One person tell you one thing a different person tells you something else. Good luck on trying to get a distribution check from them. They basically steal your money that you're entitled to and have worked for. I have tried for several months to get funds released into this day still have gotten nothing. The customer service is horrible !!! If there was a zero on a rating I would give them that. Do not trust these people with your money!!! Bottom line these people are bunch of thieves!!!

KRISTY COLLINS,"Horrible experience with Millennium Trust.   My former employer transferred my IRA rollover from Fidelity to MT when I retired.   MT held my money for 7 years with no interest and no investment income during the most profitable era in the stock market.   MT made no effort to locate me or notify me, said they did not have my address or phone and that it was not their responsibility to notify me.  Even after I gave them all my information, they never made contact.  MT made no effort to advise me, or better steward my money.   HORRIBLE financial institution with no regard for responsibly handling my money.  Also it has been difficult transferring my money to another institution."

TRACY SONTERRE-RIEGER,"Spoke with two customer representatives and both were informative, polite and quick to tackle my situation."

I was given a promise yesterday that on my 2nd account I was not going to be charged the $25 account closing fee. I was told it would be waived and I thanked her for this. Well, obviously someone didn't receive the memo because I was charged for termination of 2nd account.  You can review the promise made due to our sessions have been recorded.  If you're interested in honoring the promise and make good on our deal I will then reevaluate my position and my review will reflect this and I will restore the number of stars. If not, then this will remain my honest and true review. The decision is yours. Please honor the promise made by your company representative and waive the fee as originally promised.  Thank you,  Kevin McIntosh"

WILLIAM SIEFERT,"Normally when I call places like this and a call center representative helps me, they are usually always rude, impatient, unfriendly and just seem like they hate their jobs. But I have called Millennium Trust about four times now and all four different representatives that I have spoken to have been extremely kind, patient, and very helpful.

Denise,"I had a 4 year old retirement account that I had forgotten about that was sold to MT from a previous retirement company. I called and spoke to a Ms. Viki and Ms. Pauline who was non-judgmental and ready to help. I had Ms. Pauline on the phone for a while, she was  patient, answered all questions adequately, extremely informative and really cared that I knew everything about my account. She even went out of her way to walk me step-by-step on how to send my attachments over my new cell phone that I had never been able to do. I walked away from that phone conversation feeling like she had lifted 50 lbs. off my shoulders. My experience is ""Trust MT, the people who really cares about your future."" Thank you!"

Dp,Gwen was absolutely amazing!!! She walked me through all the steps I needed to make my withdrawal and then when things weren’t going in the right direction she got me going in the correct direction so that I was able to get the cash that I needed in an extremely short amount of time!!!
Rich,Lol the only emails I’ve received from millennium trust are two auto-generated emails (today because I’m trying to get into my account my company auto rolled to millennium) and then this feedback email (also today). So can’t wait to roll my retirement funds out of this company. Hopefully I get an account confirmation email before another BS feedback email.
Justin  Foster-Sharp,"I felt it was a very unprofessional company. When I called customer service the agent was friendly but didn’t really answer my questions. The agent also just kept on telling me to log in/ create an account in order for me to “ be able to process “or make any adjustments I want with the account. When I was finally done with completing the account opening just to close it . I got charge fees and I haven’t receive an explanation on the tax deducted, the fees that were charge at all. They do provide a pdf when you force to create account regarding their fees.however, if I am closing the account and asking for the complete amount I would like a receipt page stating how much of taxes were taken and such. This whole this just felt shady!!"

DEBRA WRIGHT,"Mtrust is a dumping ground. I did not elect to do business with them, but they put as many hurdles up as possible to prevent me from rolling my retirement funds over to a more reputable provider. I’d never intentionally do business with MTrust and would never put my employees thru it. Stay away if you can.You should not build a system, which requires people to provide so much PII data in such an unsecured manner."
Tony Zambrana,Representative was knowledgeable & courteous.
HOLLY,They are very rude and do not answer your questions. Tanisha was who I spoke with and she is very rude and could use a class on customer service. I would strongly suggest going with another company. They aren't good to work with.
MICHAEL FRANCOIS,"I would like to thank Michelle for being so patient with me during my call.  She answered all of my questions, but (through no fault of her) was unable to help me find the “I Agree “ button on the New Terms page.  Please have the department that designed this page add to button."

My prior retirement account did not have any holding fees. I would have appreciated being made aware of the fee schedule by way of email or some other communication prior to being charged.

JUSTINE Andrews,"My account was under AIG at first. I sent in paperwork to forward my IRA to my credit union. Somewhere along the line it was sent to your company, which I didn't know. I didn't find out where it was until I wondered why it hadn't gotten to my credit union. Numerous phone calls were made to your company, which did not help me in getting my money sent to my credit union. I was told by your company that it sounded like my credit union didnt want to do the work to get it transferred. Today I called to just get a statement faxed to my credit union to get this going. I was then again given instructions to go online and do it myself. I still do not have the statement with the necessary information for my credit union to get this transferred. I am beyond upset with all of these delays and phone calls and still it hasnt been resolved. I better not have any charges related to this transfer as I never authorized it in the first place."

ADRIAN,"Thank God Millennium Trust exists!  Almost walked right into an early withdrawal from my IRA just to make a private equity investment.  When I called customer service, they calmly walked me through the pre-custody process and all the documentation needed for the private equity custody checklist.  NOTE:  If you're raising money out there, do yourself a favor and get pre-qualified through Millennium Trust!  Your investors will love it, especially if they are investing from a qualified plan."
Noell Taylor,Less than one star would be best as I have not heard a word from mtrust about my account. It’s been over a week and following 2 phone calls assuring me it would be either 3 HOURS (according to phone call #1) or 3 DAYS (according to phone call #2) NOTHING.

SETH FOWLER,"The person I talked to on the phone was really quick at answering my questions, stayed on the phone while I confirmed the email she sent worked, and I was able to do what I needed.Also, getting through the automated messaging to an actual human was quick and easy, especially compared to other companies which was great!"

CHARLES MUBIRU,Withdrawing from my IRA it was very quick and easy. Thanks for making it simple
Tracey,The app is a pain i spend about 25 minutes trying to accomplish getting set up only to have it not go through and kick me back to the beginning and not save any progress.
Kevin,The website is a bit hard to navigate and the service fees are high with poor customer satisfaction.
T.Walker,"The service on withdrawal of my 401K rollover with Millennium Trust was great. The only problem I encountered with was a rep who took my initial call. She was working from home, because I heard a baby crying in the background. She was very nasty with me on the call & I had to tell her she has no way of speaking to me that way. I need help withdrawing my entire money from the company (old accounts). I asked for her help & she had an attitude. I had to tell her if I knew what I was doing I wouldn’t be seeking her help. If this going to be your attitude, customer service is not for you. I am a senior citizen & this is how I was treated by the rep. I wanted to speak with her supervisor instead, but she finally cooperated. Getting my fund was fast through direct deposit."
ANNA OUSLEY JR,Excellence custumer service i was unaware of the account i had with thos company and skeptical about my funds being transfered from my original account. The woman on the phone was very polite and informative and gave me all the information nessacary to access my funds as well as an email that explained the same just in case i couldnt remember once i recieved my welcome email.  The web site is self explanitory and very user friendly. Thank you Millennium Trust for being a delightful amd trust worthy company.
MelissaP,"I had difficulty trying to access my account after several calls, verification codes and waiting for my welcome e-mail, and was concerned about the procedures; but once I was able to create the account and log-in, the distribution form was populated and easy to follow and complete.

JENNIFER DEAN HALBERT,The lady that was helping me was so helpful. She made this phone call very easy going. Super professional!
ANDREA A,"I have been trying process a withdrawal for 10 days now.  Still no money.  No communications about what's going on.You sent me a ""reminder"" to upload a document every day for 3 days AFTER I already uploaded the document.  I had to call/hold each day to verify that you actually had received the document days before.You do not send updates.  A ""Hello valued customer. Your request has been approved."" or ""Hello valued customer, your withdrawal is being processed."" would be much appreciated.48 hours to ""approve"" me logging in to your website.  Really?  In 2021, I can create an account and login nearly instantaneously to even the most unsophisticated websites.  But, with MTrust I must pretend this is 1996 and a person is setting up my account manually when they get around to it.You quoted 9 business days to process a withdrawal???  9 days??? Is this a joke?  My previous provider processed withdrawals in 1 hour."
FRANCIS HEFLIDE,I just wanted out until I can figure out where I am at with my new job.thank you
YVONNE JACKSON,"Poor support, crappy online platform, so hard to access my funds (2nd try unsuccessful so far). I guess I'll try again (yay, 3rd try with this platform and rude/incompetent support), but unless your company's 401k company gives you no choice but to have your 401k transferred to this shop, I RECOMMEND GOING ELSEWHERE."
Sara F.,This was a quick and easy process. Thank you!
MW,Thank you for your help PS I wish you guys had an app

CARRIE TEW,The customer service representative was very polite and made sure that I was able to access the appropriate portal in order to complete my account set up and access my file.
ARNALDO REIS,"I opened a Fundrise account that uses Millennium Trust as their IRA custodian. Fundrise didn’t have the funding option I required (return of a CRD as a rollover) in their automated sign-up flow nor did their help person quite understand what to do. I contacted Millennium directly. After a two minute hold I was connected to a friendly someone who knew exactly what to do. I’m not sure how much interaction I’ll have with Millennium going forward (since I’ll primarily dealing with Fundrise) but I appreciate that their front line phone support staff have the knowledge and tools to get stuff done professionally, accurately and quickly."

Anonymous,"I needed to access my online account, I submitted my application and was able to retrieve my funds. Very smooth and simple process. Peggy was very sweet and explained my options to me. Only issue I had was, I had to call about my application after a few days, come to find out I need to send my ID. Very important step, maybe a follow up email or an active checklist of things needed would improve the wait time. Other than that, very simple and straight forward, thank you MT!"

TERESA ALFORD,Very kind and supportive with me not knowing where my 401 had went.

MARK MOLNAR,Easy and fast service
ENRIQUE MANCO,Answering system not clear.  Web page process for disbursement or changes is not easy to determine.  I have no experience but the first impression.  Regards
DANIEL MCHENRY,"MT is High Level ""Legal"" Scam!!!This is a High Level ""Legal"" Scam in which employers sell 401Ks to ""trust"" companies like Millennium Trust and then this unscrupulous corporation charges ""annual maintenance fees"" on these accounts until they're empty while employees do not know and/or forget about these accounts and loose their rightful retirement money. Also, if you attempt to transfer this money to a different and more respectable 401k company, they will make sure to pretend they never received the paperwork from that other company. Unbelievable. Corporate Thieves!!!"

SUSAN PANEPINTO,Great customer service... thanks for your help...

JONESHIA BRAXTON,"My previous employer moved my 401K to Millennium Trust without my knowledge because my amount was below their threshold.  Although I did not agree with this I also ignored the letters and emails they sent to me because I didn't want to do anything with my 401K.  That was my fault not Millennium Trusts.  Once it was transferred I was upset and also thought the maintenance fees were quite high, however I found Millennium Trust is very straight forward with their fees and processes.  I followed their directions and logged in successfully no problem to my account.  I also read all the negative reviews about Millennium Trust and thought it would be a nightmare to get my money transferred or withdraw and waited a year to try.  I have to say, it was very easy and straight forward again to move and close my account.  I don't know what the big fuss was with the negative reviews.  Just following their directions I had my money transferred in a few days to my bank account.  I was pleasantly surprised.  If you don't like that your money was moved to them just follow the directions and move it where you want, don't bash Millennium Trust.  I gave them 4 stars because of what I thought were high fees.  In one year I was charged $80 for opening, yearly maintenance and closing."

BETTY COWELL,"Unable to login on my android phone using Google Chrome with desktop view. I've logged in before with no issues. I've tried all 3 platforms; MTC investment trust, MT online, and MAP to see if it would work. I've also used the link sent to me via email which is the secure.mtrustcompany website.Whenever I do get past the log in page the next page has my phone number and to input the security code sent to my phone. I enter the security code and it states ""access unavailable for this user. Invalid request. Log ID 3792129"" and to contact something called invest cloud during business hours.I'm hoping it's just a glitch or perhaps my phone. I am giving it a try on my laptop to see if it works with that. If not I guess I'll be calling back for some help."

Thomas Ware,"I tried moving my account to another custodian who does not charge an annual fee and MTrust held my account and would not transfer my assets until I paid another annual fee.  On top of that they charged me more fees.  In an age where fees are going away, I can't see how this company stays in business or why anyone would keep their assets with this firm."

Carlos Varas,I utilized the site and it was very easy toUse!
CHRISHUNDIA IVY,"Horrible communication, after several phone calls their transfer did not work.  I believe they do not want you to either invest your money, or transfer it elsewhere.  The login has continued to fail after full reset multiple times.  (Feels like I'm in an episode of 'The Truman Show'.)"
DONNA BOND,"This Company wow me . First with their internet platform, they make you feel you are secure. Second the process was so smooth and comfortable. Everything was above and beyond with Millennium Trust."
CHRISTOPHER GOODING,I don't like that there are withdrawal fees when closing an account.  My money was forced into this IRA from another employee based IRA and I did not have enough time to decide what to do.  It wouldn't be as bad but the fact that there is a fee with closing an account is unfair in my opinion.

Kevin Towey,Lacks the ability to transition to a new custodian. I get it from a business perspective but I can tell you they won't be getting recommendations from me and I'll be telling people to run fast if I hear the name again. Held my funds for over a year even though I followed procedures and my new custodian even reached out.

R. Porter,"It has been nothing short of operating efficiently and effectively during my new and short experience; everything from the initial notification in the mail regarding the update on my IRA account&how to access it, from the seamlessly quick process in verifying my identity in order to access the account, as well as the simple navigation of the website itself and a short comprehensive way to cash in the distribution with no loop holes or extensive waiting periods.It’s refreshing to see that and I think worth mentioning so if you could pass that information along I would appreciate that as well."

AMOUR BOUBELO,"So far my communication with Millennium Trust has been great. My 401k plan was switched to Millennium, and they were able to quickly help me roll it over to my new employer's plan. This was far easier and more smooth than the process with the previous employer's plan."

Diane,First time contacting them good experience
BOBBIE SCOTT,Problem was receiving a new link to reset password. The rep on the phone kept insisting she was sending it as if I have no idea how to locate an email. Still no password reset and issue is not resolved
JAMES GREGORY,"While your website and enrollment process were easy and user friendly, I cannot get over the fact that my account was sold to Millennium Trust back in June and I was never contacted about my account. No letters. No emails. No phone calls. Nothing. In fact, the only way reason that I knew to call Millennium Trust was I got a statement from my old provider that showed a $0 balance. I called to inquire. That is when I was informed that the account had been transferred to MT. This is not a good way to start off a business relationship."
ANNE OLSEN-HAYWARD,"The Company that I was with started an IRA for its employees, my acc grew to just over 2k when the company closed shop and my IRA  got moved to Millennium, Millennium never sent me notification that it was rolled over or called to let me know and how i’d like to invest, never a statement, nor did they work my IRA, sorry yes they did work my IRA by charging me fees and who knows what else cause my IRA I come to find out is down now to a bit over 1k, i’m a small fish I guess cause i’m off the frying pan and on their dinner plate. Best of luck you small fish considering Millennium, In my case they didn’t do their job."
LONNELL WATLINGTON,Great customer service. My rep was knowledgeable and willing to help.

DANIELLE REID,"Unhelpful at best.Customer service claimed that I would not need to go online to perform certain functions, but the documentation sent immediately told me to perform actions online.   Would not recommend this company to friends."
SHIREEN FERNANDEZ,Millennium Trust has always handled my request with very little to no contact at all.  When Guidance was needed in the past they have been very helpful and professional.  Great organization!!!
MARLENE MONDESIR,Great friendly people and fast customer service.
Reluctant account holder,"The best part about the company is the customer service representatives are very pleasant and patient. Otherwise, After creating my account… I was told I’d receive a welcome letter.. I didn’t receive it, until I called the next day…. I  followed all of the instructions from them I am on my 3rd going on 4th day trying to gain access to my account. I’ve put in all the correct information and I still have had no success. I’m very annoyed.update- After contacting the company once again (excellent customer service as always) it was discovered that my account had been blocked for trying so many times. I informed the rep that I had been putting in the correct information all along, so there was no reason to be locked out. She wasn't able to provide me with an explanation however was very patient while I went through the necessary steps to gain access to my account. Still there is the unanswered question of why wasn't I able to gain access to my account in the first place, if I entered all of the correct information."

Terrence Matthews,"The person who assisted me, was helping me very good and explained all I asked. Thanks"
BENJAMIN BAGGETT,"This isn't a review of Millennium Trust, but of the whole system.  It's antiquated, rigged, and a loser's game.  I'm liquidating everything and eating all of the stupid fees and fines and investing in something real, something positive for individuals, something able to be audited on the fly and with true peace of mind.  And that is Bitcoin.  I liquidate all of this and buy bitcoin.  This system is over, follow suit or die unhappy and disgruntled.  Buy bitcoin."
DAVID BECKENDORF,"The woman was very professional over the phone and I appreciate all her time, honesty, and help."
RACHELLE CAMACHO,Had a hard time working through the computer program filling out a form I called and they got me to a specialist that walked me through it and we got it taken care of everybody was helpful polite great to work with and had a lot of patience.

SUNNY NGUYEN,Very polite and efficient help with our needs.
MARSHA MCDERMOTT,"The specialist I spoke to was extremely rude and belittling. Given that I work in medical and have no experience in financial whatsoever, still no representative of a company should talk to her customer that way. This is a definite sign for me to move on with another financial company."
GARRY NOEL,"Helpful, friendly and knowledgeable staff."
JOSHUA GARCIA,"I had no control of my money coming here. The fees are outrageous. My money just sat in cash and was never invested. Then, when I tried to make changes to my account over the phone they forced me to create an online account even though I requested avoiding starting an online account. Do not recommend and will never voluntarily put my money here."
JASON ECHARD,My online experience was great easy to navigate through my profile and response to help me was quick and very helpful! Thank you!
MARK HILDERBRAND,I was BLOWN away with how helpful the woman I talked to on the phone was. I was confused and stating to get frustrated but she resolved all of my issues within 15 minutes. I wish I had her name to share because she deserves a raise.
CASMINE MCGROWDER,"For months now, I have been trying to set up online access to my rollover account from a previous employer. Months. Every time I think I'm about to get access, something stops me. It's usually the website's refusal to send a verification code and the lack of transparency around why it refuses. For the longest time, this was because I needed to supply identity validation documents, but the website never actually directed me to do so. It just happily let me click the ""resend code"" button over and over, without supplying any feedback, and never actually sending a code. Tech support helped me out, and my account has finally been set up! Only, I can't log into yet because I need a temporary MFA code to do so, and - SURPRISE! - the website refuses to send one, with very little acknowledgement of the error on the page, no indication that the company is aware of it, and no means to directly communicate the problem to support. After months of trying to access my account, I'm extremely frustrated by the experience. The only saving grace is a gracious and responsive support staff."
ANGELA FAUGHT,"A former employer found an accounting error in my favor and gave me $600.  These crooks took $70 of it for the privileged of writing me a check!Response to company:  I don't use phones, the number you called is a Google Voice number that just has voice mail and text so I can't call you back.  You stated that you refunded the fees to the account, but that makes no sense since I closed the account and am waiting for you to send me a check to send to my current 401k provider.  If you did refund the $60 to the account, that means a new account will be opened and you'll charge me $60 to get the money out of it.  Of course, then I went to your site today and it says my account is still open, the fees weren't refunded, and another $25 fee was charged!  So now I don't even know what's going on over there.  I need a check from you made out to my current 401k provider for the full amount that ADP accidentally sent to you and I need it overnighted to me today!"
JACOB STABLES,The representative today stayed on with me until all my issues were resolved. She needs a raise or free lunch. Something to let her know customers value her. Lovely person.
STEPHANIE PEREZ,"The associate was very patient, knowledgeable, and a great help."
DERBIN BERDIN,I wasn’t able to talk to anyone personally just digitally I don’t fully trust the process
ARASELI GOMEZ,"My 401K just got started at Empower when I changed jobs, so they rolled it over into an IRA with Millennium Trust.  I received no notice of what had happened to my money, so I had to request this information from Empower.  After I contacted Millennium Trust, they gave me a set of instructions to set up my account online before they would give me answers or an account number, then charged me $30 for doing so.  I've never heard of this company and never consented to do business with them.  I want my $514 sent to me or rolled over to a reputable company like Fidelity.  Since I can't talk to a live person at Millennium Trust to get resolution, I'm talking to attorneys."
MARIANNE PINGITORE,I spoke with Chelsea and she was awesome!!  I really appreciated her patience in walking me through the process online and answered all of my questions. I am hoping her supervisor sees my remarks because I was very impressed with Chelsea!
SAFFIATOU FAYE,Great experience for me! Millennium Trust did a fantastic job responding to my questions!
Anthony Mccorquodale,Had a problem logging in. SMS with a 6-digit code wasn't being sent after I entered my phone number. The representative understood immediately what was happening. Did some magic on her end. Problem solved in less than a minute.
Jbright,Friendly and helpful! Answered all my questions and knew the form once I told them what one I had and breeze right to the answers I had problems with!

WALTER DUNKERSON,Hard to work with. My financial guy said he’s never had to jump thru so many hoops. The web site won’t give access and I have to pay them to get MY money. This should be illegal.
LISA CONAWAY,The customer service was amazing. They answered all of my questions and concerns.
Kajajan,Your representatives were very helpful and knowledgeable. Thank you I'm happy to keep my account with you all.
STEPHANIE ONEIL,i wish there was a way for a customer rep to do the distribution process for us it was quite the hassle to get a computer and scanner to view and upload documents thats way it got a 4 star from me
SUZANNE RITCHIE,It shouldn't be this hard to get an account number to transfer a  small retirement account.  This is the only time I personally have had to take action to transfer money vs my investment representative doing it for me.
ROBIN MCELROY,Have to go through way to much to get your money transferred.
Tammy Thomson,Experience was smooth after 12+ hours of being denied access to the site.

C Smith,It was easy to navigate through everything I needed to do. You quickly responded to my requests. Thank you
LAUREN TREADAWAY,Website for this company is an epic fail.

PHILIP HARLOW,"My retirement account with a former employer was dissolved and the account balance sent to Millennium Trust. To get the funds out and into an IRA account, they charge an annual service fee, and account creation fee and an account closing fee. All that for an account that existed for a few minutes. What a rip-off!"
VAL,I cannot navagate without filling out this review.
Doris,"Very pleasant, friendly attitude. Very helpful."
SEMU WALUSIMBI,Easy User Friendly  website

Vijay Suri,"My experience with Millennium Trust Company has been outstanding so far. Yolanda Z provided stellar service over the phone where she was professional, knowledgeable, and offered service with a smile (yes her positive disposition came across over the phone.) It was crystal clear how dedicated Yolanda is to MTC customers and their vision, values, culture and people. The website is one of the best I have encountered in financial services. The site is intuitive and well designed. All in all, a very positive experience where I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Millennium Trust Company to others and I hope our paths cross again in the future."

George,"Thank you being a safe, secure website in which I was able to access my account. The process looped three times which tells this retired teacher that there is a problem with your web pages... especially since those of us accessing them are over age 59 !/2... we may be computer saavy at 59-1/2... but at age 65+ or higher... easy things aren't so easy anymore... it took me @ 2 hours to get through it all.  However, I really felt like you were a great company... very cordial phone call with the initial contact. Thank you."
LU-ANN CAMPBELL,"Excellent service. Received a postcard in the mail, updated the account info online, spoke to rep about additional account login and help with name change. She was very helpful and knowledgeable. For something that could have been very complicated, I found it to be actually quite easy and streamlined. And I was finally reaquainted with old IRA and Roth IRA accounts that I didn't even know existed!  It's almost like free money!"
VALERIE COOPER,Worst experience ever trying to move my account to a new broker.

The representative I spoke with was knowledgeable, professional and polite, and followed up with a phone call as promised to make sure my problem was resolved. Wait time was very minimal.Update 10/19 - same issue reappeared and this time customer service was unable to provide me with an acceptable resolution. This does not appear to be a quality organization and I intend to move my IRA ASAP."
RACHEL V,"Yuriana was very helpful and patient with me and walked me through the steps I needed to take. The best customer experience I had in a long time!! Kudus Best, Haniel"
DANIEL THOMAS,"I couldn't get into my account online. The first customer service representative was horrible.  She actually asked me if I knew how to use the internet.  She was aggressive and acted like I was bothering her.  I actually told her I would try her way but would hang up since I knew she was busy. I immedietely called back and the new Customer Service rep was polite, patient and knowledgeable.  She immediately sent me link that worked.  The security.mtrust website I was using was the wrong website. The new rep had me online and working my account in less than 5 minutes.  THAT REP DESERVED 5 stars.  The first barely earned 2."
Shameka Dickerson,I don't know why you make it so complicated for me to get my own money back. I've had to jump through so many hoops to roll over my IRA which I never directed to you in the firest place -- it should be easier . . . .
SAMUEL RENE,"Representative was very courteous and professional. He not only took the time to answer all my questions, but was kind enough to actually walk me through the process and remain on the phone with me. He was very knowledgeable and patient with answering all my questions and guiding me in the right direction. Much appreciation."
ANDrew s,"The representative I talked to, Vicky, was very informative and helpful in guiding me to the web page for what I wanted to do. Vicky was a great help. Process on web page was very simple as well."
customer,"If you don’t finish a form submission the same day, it seems to get deleted. Otherwise the site is pretty easy to navigate."
Latonya Martin,The last representative that I spoke with seemed short with me and had undertones of rudeness during my interaction I was just seeking clarity that everything was done right after receiving confusing information from a previous rep which resulted in mengetting help from a supervisor ( who was great) and that seemed to bother her if you go back and listen to the call you should be able to tell that I was talking to someone I wouldn't want to talk to again
Fran,Service was easy...
MICHELLE MARKS,Lost almost $100 dollars in less then a year.
Tameka Fauntroy,"Thank you so much , I called with questions concerning my account . Everything was explained to me and was very easy to do on my account after the young man explained it to me."

NORMAN MORALES,"the letter I received was not very detailed in what was needed. the person I spoke to on the phone was helpful in advising me what the letter really meant and what I need to submit,"

JACE BAILEY,Yesenia was really helpful with my inquiry. She walked me through the process and explained everything in detail. It was a wonderful experience.
HART KING,"Service Rep I spoke with(the second time) was super friendly and polite, the first one not so much. The process overall was a little complicated considering my former employer had just rolled money to you 10 days prior.  Not a smooth transition and ridiculously complicated to create an online account and control my money so that I could transfer it out to an investor of my choice."
KANDICE PIEL,Was a good thing experience  work with yours..
DONNA PARTIN,"Customer service is impeccable, service speed impeccable I have no complaints!"
Joann D,Super fast and easy to request and receive my distribution.

JULIA LEI,"While I didn't specifically choose Millennium, my previous IRA company did and forwarded my account to them after a job change. The transition has been simple. A single phone call familiarized me with the account and how it works. Stock commissions are higher than many retail brokerages at $8/trade, but it's not unreasonable for a self-directed account outside of a major brokerage like Schwab. Their portal is fairly easy to use, and trades executed quickly with both Market and Limit Orders. So far, so good."
Arnita Drafton,"I sent an explanatory email for the transaction in question. Following that, you sent an email to the fund manager. I don't understand why that was necessary."

TERRY SAVAGE,Takes time just to get to so one thing Too many unnecessary steps and woe if you don't remember your log in you will be frustrated and easy to give up.

RONALD WEBER,So far it has been a seamless experience. I will know more next week when the accounts are processed.
William Blue,"The website for our personal accounts can be some what confusing and cause a person to make errors. I say this because, once you have completed doing something, if your not careful it will take you right back to redoing it all over again instead of closing it out and taking you back to your home page."
Chris A,"Good job in reconnecting me to funds I didn't know I still had from the Safeco job. Thanks for your assistance, and promptness in returning this to me."
MARIESHA FORD,Its ok. I wish it had more uptions
Janet Lewis,Quick and easy and helped me with my questions thank you
Tim Hahn,I have been trying to cash out my account for over a month. My money was rolled over to Millennium Trust from a previous employer without my consent. Every phone call to Millennium Trust I get a different answer and the run around and non of the representatives can tell you anything.  I was told for weeks everything looks good then all of the sudden it's not. I am very disappointed in this company and never will use Millennium Trust again.
PHILIP SCHUMM,Needed help with signing in. Representative was amazing! Fast efficient and so nice! Thank you
Barbra Reeves,Jessica did a great job and was a pleasure to speak with.
GARY EGGLESON,"To summarize I've had a small amount of money set aside in this account for a while from a previous employer. I had never been given instructions on how to roll it over to my new employer's 401K programs it was from one of my first jobs so I just let it sit. Turned out that was for the better because due to some circumstances in the pandemic I needed to withdraw the funds early. I had been setting up this capability for some time by establishing the online account, adding in my banking information, etc. When it came time to withdraw the funds, however, this place made it almost impossible to do so. I bank with PNC, they're huge and international, and when I verified the bank they said it could not be verified. That I was required to do it manually. The only option they list is to do that via a voided check. While yes it's a checking account, I don't actually own any checks. So, I gave a banking statement, but, apparently that was not acceptable. After a phone call with more than one transfer to get me to the right place, I was told I could go into the bank and get a letter on bank letterhead stating my name, the account number, the banks name, and the ABA routing number. All of this information had already been entered online mind you. Also, we are still in a pandemic and banking hours are difficult to make on a good day let alone during times of crisis. I asked for an alternative option to receive my money, expecting them to be able to cut a check like other institutions. No, I was told my only other option would be a pre-paid credit/debit card and to have that mailed to me. Well I am now short on time after having to deal with all of this and needed the money so I had no choice but to take it. I sincerely hope that it doesn't get lost in the mail as I was NOT provided a tracking number, and, at least a check can be voided and re-cut, I don't know what would happen if the card got lost. So you are putting thousands of my hard earned dollars at risk and honestly of the 4 financial institutions I've dealt with for 401K this is possibly the worst one. How is it Voya and Vanguard could both verify my banking account information with the conglomerate that is PNC but you were unable to do so? If ever given the choice to utilize Millenium's services again I would not do it."
GODFRED ADJEI,"I've been very happy with Millennium Trust. It allows me to invest in the opportunities that many IRA accounts do not. You can contact support when you need it, and there's a real person on the other end."

IRENE MARMOLEJO,"Robin was accommodating and understanding. I had my account rolled over when my work ended, and they had never sent me the paperwork with my options. She was so understanding and did not talk down to me at all. The folks who had my 401K were not as lovely. She was great, and someone needs to know that!! She listened to me vent and was spot on! She even wished me a safe and fun vacation! I cannot thank her enough for going above and beyond, waiting until I have set up my whole account and then explaining the next steps. Just amazing patience!"
KEVAN,Made it very easy to close out my 401k!!!
JACOB WATSON,Fast service ! Great customer experience all around
Gene,I appreciate you all y’all was very compassion and very helpful and y’all walk me through everything perfectly and I am so greatful for that and y’all patience and time and again thank you.
Dave s,I honestly don’t understand where my money went. I had invested $5000.00 or more into my 401k but my investment only retuned $1300.00 of my initial investment. Why?
JORGE QUINTANILLA,The young lady that I will leave unnamed help greatly navigate the mass enormous informational website.It took almost 2 hours to get the proper documentation filled out properly with my inexperience.She was very patient and understanding I would hope to receive her as my next assistant in any matters I may have with this new company I have received two management this portfolio. I have given it three stars based on her performance along I wished I could give more but time will tell on the performance of the company as a whole.

EMILY DIAZ,Great and easy experience.
Mrs. STONE,David was very helpful and efficient. He gave me all the information I needed.
JOHN,"The print form sent by mail, and the online web service (which took so many steps to subscribe to, not all intuitive) made it virtually impossible to close out the account and just get a cashable check for the meager balance remaining.  I ended up just plain giving up, and asked for one of the debit cards.  Which has yet to arrive."
ADAM JOHNSON,I had a smooth process with them. Website is also user friendly.
MARK OLSZEWSKI,"I'm giving one star because of the amount of legwork I'm having to do to get my employer sponsored 401k transferred into a traditional IRA with my financial institution. According to my financial institution, the requirements from Millennium Trust is far more than what is typically required for transferring 401k's into a traditional IRA."
KYLEE KASKA,"In the area of money and online scams, this company, Millennium Trust, did EVERYTHING to reassure me that the company was trustworthy.  I appreciated that.  From the ""mailed"" letter with concise information for reaching support people; to the online protocols for signing in and receiving verification; To the follow up email; to the simplicity of transferring funds to other IRA depositories or banks...the process was quite painless and security minded.  Thank you."

SAM,The lady I worked with on the phone on 9/29/21 was wonderful and stayed with me until the work was done.
Stefanie Bough,"The process to access my money when I found out MONTHS after that they had taken my money without permission. I have no use for this company.  I will be taking my money back to my original organization and have nothing to do with you ever again. Then when it came to getting my money, I had to 'claim' each one of my accounts. I HAD TO DO THIS TO EVERY ONE OF MY ACCOUNTS RATHER THAN HAVING THE ABILITY TO DO MULTIPLES.The form filing is terrible.  I can't autofill AND then:  Filling out my phone number had to be in a format that I had to add the dashes. Same baloney for the birth date. Who makes a form filler have to add the dashes. Get with the 21st C."
RANDI GROSSMILLER,"My customer service rep, Marylin  couldn’t have been better!  Kind, knowledgeable, and VERY PATIENT!!  Also very reassuring!  I’m glad Marylin was my customer service representative!!!"

Cecilia Grijalva,He was very helpful and knowledgeable. Thank you for your time!
PRANAM KOKILAKUMAR,Amazingly quick service.
ADINA EVANS-SMITH,"To be candid, the whole experience seemed like a Phishing scam. I still wonder if it is.  There many times (almost always, actually), where it incessantly queried me for my personal information over and over and over again....When I finally was able to do something, I clicked on the Trade button to start investing in my IRA.  It said I couldn't trade.  The interface was deplorable.In the end I opted to cash out my IRA (something I would not normally do), just to be rid of this accursed account.  I am left wondering if I will receive funds in the way of a debit card to be sent to my home address.   I might have tried to fill out the transfer of funds to another IRA or, perhaps, transfer to a bank.  However, I am so suspicious that the whole ordeal is a Phishing scam that I didn't want to give you any further information. I wonder if I""m going to be charged an annual fee and then be contacted by a collections agent four years from now.    I'm wondering if I am going to get excessive billing from my phone carrier for some obscene amount of money as part of the whole scam."
PAUL ZEPERNICK,There service is very professional and helpful
HARRY BURDICK III,I had a very good experience and it is easy to navigate within the online service.

Uncle Argile,Quick and easy. Website easy to find information.
KRISTY ST GERMAINE,I am truly impressed with the turnaround time. The website was user friendly.
Bad communication,Very helpful team. Told them what I needed and we got it done. Thanks for your help.
Nazir Mohammad,Horrible experience - cannot obtain my balance; spoke to a very nice lady on the phone for over an hour - finally setup account and after providing her and scanning in all of my identification she could not give me my balance - you are holding MY MONEY hostage - my x employer transferred my funds to you when they sold - I WANT MY MONEY - I WANT ACCESS - HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE I have tried and tried to get online - it is like you are holding my money hostage.  Millennium Trust SUCKS.
LORI GACH,"Millennium Trust is safe, fast, and great way to save money for retirement! I had such a great experience with them!!!"
ANTHONY,Great company to work with. Explain thing easy to understand
DESHON SMITH,Several steps to get through but I’m thankful for the security.
JUDY ASHLEY,When I had questions while conducting business online I called an operator from Millennium Trust and was walked through my process. They were patient and very helpful and the experience was great.
CONNIE KENNEDY,"Had my 401k transferred to them by my company and I only got one letter from them telling me they have my money. 3 years later, they keep charging me fees until I decided to take it all out, and SURPRISE! Instead of getting back what I deposited plus interest for using my money, I get back less because I kept getting charged.UPDATE Oct 8:I called and asked about my charges with CAMILLE and she said I will be getting a refund within the next few days since I wasn't notified about them. It's been more than a week and nothing. Their system is very sketchy!UPDATE NOV 4: Still no refund but I noticed they updated their replay on my review to make it look like the have taken care of everything when in fact they didn't even call me yesterday to check if I ever got my fees back. HUGE RED FLAG!Update Nov 10: I have finally received a check with the amount I was taxed without notification. The company seemes to be legit and obeys US laws but I would definitely not recommend them to friends or use them again because keeping track of your money and managing it is very difficult in an era where everyone else puts these facilities at your fingertips on an app"
LAZARO ENRIQUEZ,"They was very professional, answered all my questions, and I got paid within days. Thank you…"
Paul Beaudoin,"The rep that I had- Vicki- was very knowledgeable and precise in diagnosing my problem, assisting me with resolving the problem, & making sure that I was good to go before our call ended."
Jan,I was transferred 3 times and on hold for over an hour. Finally called on another line and got a customer service agent who literally could not provide the information needed to close my account and transfer funds to another entity. Worthless for over 2 hours of waiting and conversation. Thankfully moving away from this three ring circus. Terrible communication!
ROSA LUNA,"Ryan was a super helpful agent! He gave me directions on setting up my account and even prompted me give insight on the additional help I would need after I got the account, which he then answered as well.It was a great experience overall!"
HUMBERTO DORANTES HERNANDEZ,"The representative that answered my call was very rude, short tempered. She continually talked over me and would not allow me to explain my situation. She then rushed me off the line and disconnected the call. This is my first time call in to Millennium Trust, and this is by far the worst customer service I have ever experienced. She either needs proper training, or a new line of work."
MICHELE FLEMMINGS,Millennium Trust portal was very easy to navigate and was able to conclude my transaction in less than 3 minutes😊
KERISTEN BURKS,Very easy to use site. Loved it
rasheedamuhammad,Very impressed with your staff and efficient online service
KISHORE MANCHIKALAPATI,Excellent guidance
Leah Sheldon,Millennium Trust's site is user-friendly. I was able to accomplish what I wanted. I don't know much about the company since I never opened an account with them. The account was open from a former employer and Millennium Trust sent me information regarding the account or I would have never known.
SHEMUWEL RUSS,Awesome customer service from Terri out of the Pittsburg Office. She found out that my account was located under Christop instead of Christopher. She deserves to be recognized because she went above and beyond. She was extremely patient with me and continued to assist me by talking me through everything that I needed to accomplish including how to send an e-mail with my iPhone. She's totally an asset to the Company.

I do not have hard evidence of value and as the company is effectively shut down, there is no one there to respond to MT's request for valuation.  I real ""catch 22"". Dealing with Millennium on this matter has been like trying to deal with the IRS - both are ridiculous bureaucracies."

Aroman Fogel,"When requesting money I selected to have the 10% withheld, does this 10% go towards taxes? Also when selecting to have 10% withheld, it should have been communicated it was going to reduce the funds received and I would of had further money allocated to ensure receipt of the full $2,000 requested."

Mavis,"I have been with MTC for around 10-years. My IRA there has about six active alternative assets in it. The application process to upload these assets and the regular servicing and administration of them has been consistently seamless. Their proactive communication is excellent regarding fees, regulatory rules changes I need to know about, any info delinquencies regarding my assets, etc. Any time I need to do anything out of the ordinary such as add or remove funds from the account, receive a special distribution, pay out a capital call, etc. MTC has made it easy. I can always get a knowledgable person on the phone to concierge whatever task is at hand. I would highly recommend anyone to MTC who has alternative asset IRA custodian needs. 5-stars well earning and special shout out to Chris Wadington who has been particularly helpful throughout the years."

Your e-mails are confusing without recourse.  Your questions are confusing without recourse.  Your paperwork is incredibly overwhelming.Did you ever hear of ""hard copies"" and ""regular mail""?  I know full well thatyou are trying to save money but until we all die off, please make it a biteasier for senior citizens!

DANIEL PEREZ,"Decent folks, that don't care (in a good way.)These are people who are acting as a reasonable, safe middle man for your money. And they are INCREDIBLY good about going the extra step. The entirety of my experience was atypical given I had a strange transfer and a few weird requests and a couple phone calls that could have been annoying as they required including a third party and generally extra work.Nope. They don't care, they're here to help, whatever you need, including literally walking me through signing up online just in case any of the pieces were confusing given my slightly odd structure/request.I'm currently building my own business but when I'm looking for a place for us to put company investment money and employee retirement funds I'm coming straight back here. Good folks."

Mary Neva,"My former employer transferred my 401k to this company when it was sold shortly after I left. Millennium Trust never attempted to contact me, and I had to track them down through the previous 401k provider (Fidelity). All I needed was a statement so I could have my financial planner move the balance, but I had to register online and I’m still waiting. I have no idea what my balance is, but someone I spoke with at the company said it’s sitting in a traditional IRA and not being invested. However, they can’t even tell me what my balance is until my online account is approved. I’ve never encountered an experience like this company and it really rubs my financial planner and myself the wrong way."
Michael Pagan,Used the internet (google search) to get to the website which led me to a login page that didn't work so had to call and after a long hold was told it's a dead landing page.Also I registered two accounts but only one shows up.

TERRENCE HEWING,Very helpful in the process of rolling over my retirement savings account to another company.
Justine NGHIEM,Employer transferred old 401k account here. I was not notified by  The Bancorp when they were the custodian and transferred the account to Millenium which caused a pretty hefty decrease because of account maintenance fees. Not Millennium's fault. $25 to close account :(
Harrison Yaidoo,"Woman who helped me was great, but your systems are horrible!"
Niechia Champion,"Never got notification that your company had acquired my account, yet when I called in about my account, you had all my information to verify my account and you charge a $35 maintenance fee, for no services provided, to transfer my money out. So thanks for nothing."

R. WILLIAMS,Associates contacted by phone were cordial and very helpful in providing directions to complete required information.
JASON MOHLER,Cannot figure the web Site out to log into
MICHELLE FERNANDEZ,Your process is way to many steps to get my money. And you’re charging me fees without ever getting my approval or permission.

Mz. Macdrea,Efficient and professional quickly assessed my inquiry and provided clear directions

H LE,Had to use phone and talked to real humans who helped me. Very rare these days. Cudos to you guys.

Pat F.,Excellent and prompt customer service. Smoothest transaction I think I’ve ever had!!

KAREN RANDOLPH,The download fee schedule thing obstructed me finishing. Eventually I figured it out but it’s quite ridiculous. I had to do it every time I had to do something. Although I am sure the company has its reasons. Either way the customer service person was awesome. It ended up being very easy to do and I get to pay off my credit card!
MARQUITA THOMAS,I’m waiting for the statement I requested from the transfer of funds and still have not received anything from the company. Chantel Bastin

Tom,Had an issue with my sign-on.  The representative was very experienced and patient.
KELLY HOLDEN,"My entire 401K balance was moved from Fidelity to Millennium Trust without notice or my permission. No phone call, no email, no letter. Nothing.It was entirely up to ME to notice that suddenly my account had a balance of $0 (good thing I check frequently) and then try to put together the mystery as to WHERE DID MY MONEY GO?Why do I even need to ASK such a question?Imagine how you would have reacted in this situation.With persistence, I was able to track down my money. Had several phone calls with unhelpful people, and then I had to wait several weeks just to be able to access my money again. Again, cannot over-emphasize this part: MY MONEY.I say this because they treated the situation like the funds in question were theirs, or belonged to some other entity, or some fund manager, or just a few numbers on a computer screen printout. They really do not have the notion that what we're talking about is 100% MINE.I moved everything out of Millennium Trust into a new account where I feel it is now finally safe again. Whew!Truly unbelievable.Quick followup. Some unknown person from Millennium Trust responded to this post to give readers the impression that they took quick action. But don't be fooled. They said they would call, but never did.Followup #2.  Someone from Millennium posted back on this thread again and invited me to give them one more chance, and asked that I call them. I did, and the only thing that happed was they put me on endless hold. So bad. Really."
CAROL MERRICKS,"Super easy, girl on the phone was easy to understand and helpful."

SUSAN FITZGERALD,"Call was excellent, hung in there till the end. great service"
SUSAN JOHNSON,Enjoyed my experience with Millennium Trust
TK,"Called twice was on hold for 20 min both time, The all three of the customer service reps ( was transferred) where not very helpful they could not explain what the FMV OF ACCOUNT was on my statement. They could not confirm the balance of my account. The website/link to set up username and login( that was emailed to me) would not accept any of the login names I tried, I tried like 8 different ones, no where did it say the requirements of the username, I guess that you had to use an email as a login. I had to call back in and wait on hold again to find that out. I guess we are going to be charged $85 just to get our money/ retirement out of the program. This hole Process took me from 3:40- 7:13, that is ridiculous and not customer friendly!"

I was thankful to Millennium Trust for the information they provided me when I was contemplating a distribution. I didn't choose Millennium Trust, it was just where it landed after being tossed here and there when I left my former employer. Thank you Millennium Trust for your service. I would recommend them in the future."

WILLIAM GRAHAM,Jake handled everything quickly and efficiently.  All my questions were answered.  He got the job done!
ck,"The help is there, available to get.  The waiting time on the phone is reasonable.  The help, however, will only go as far as showing the tools on their server, or website page.  I still feel like I am traveling uncharted territory!"
Don Conoscenti,The fees are ridiculous.   $35 charge on a $200 account.   $10 roll over fee.  Extra processing steps to move money to a different company
MARIA VOLKERDING,Compassionate and professional consultation provided.
Sergei Ikovenko,"Agent service is always great.  What troubles me is the new illustration of our accounts.  Its the perfect example of ""please don't change it unless you know what you're doing!""  Its (now) an Onion, painted Red and called an apple, that with the first bite, reverts to an Onion.  THe developer had absolutely no input from clients who aren't bankers and using this site every day.The site needs tutorials and webinars if its going to stay in its present form, that of a very unintuitive way to figure out if money is credited / debited to my account."
KATHLEEN PORTER,"Very nice, very helpful!"
KELLEE CAPECE,My only complaint is that it is difficult to login to the account.

PETER SMEY,This is a money grab not a place to grow your money. Don't believe me? Check out their fees.
Regina Elwell,"My 401K funds were sent without my knowledge and I had to pay a fee to have my funds released.  And, that process was delayed by having to do the documents online instead of everything being handled when I called the customer service number.  The representatives I spoke to were nice and professional, but I was a bit frustrated that I had to do so much to  have my funds sent to me, especially since I was not aware that my former employer would do this."
ROBERT M,"Chris Evers has been extraordinary in making complicated financial decisions simple, and something we can understand .We feel confident in our financial future with Chris assisting us and making knowledgeable choices. We walked out of the office relaxed and not anxious regarding our financial future. This was a great improvement for us, and has given us peace. Thanks Chris for just being the kind, smart person you are and helping take a huge load off our minds!"

DONALD RUDD,"I am 67years old & have worked for one of the largest banks in the US, now retired.  All I wanted was to close out this account with Millennium, who I do not know anything about.  BMO Harris Bank should not have transferred my money without my permission.  I felt that I was getting the run around with your company.  I am still dealing with this issue & now I have to go back to BMO Harris.  Your process is horrible!!!  I have sent a email to other BMO employee's and told them not to let BMO transfer their investment to your company.  I have soon to never hear of your company again.  The worst experience (still ongoing) I have ever dealt with."

I don't like to keep representives on the line while I figure it all out myself first.He repeated the answers to my questions, that I needed to correctly get it right. Which I always need in these complicated situations.He was wonderful and should get a big, fat raise!!! For his kindness. :}}}}}"
MANAS SETHI,We triedI tried to get information about an IRA that I have with M trust company.I could not log on to my account It told me my info was invalid.Even after a rep was helping me and gave me a new password it would not work.The only reason I am giving you a rating of 4 and not 1 is because the rep that worked with me would not give up. and kept trying to make it work. In the end we were not successful.
CHRISTOPHER HENLEY,"Funds from a previous employer were transferred to MT without my knowledge or agreement. When I tried to create an account and log in, I got as far as the place where they were supposed to send me a 6 digit confirmation that never arrived. I called them, was put on hold for 13 minutes and cut off. I called again, and while I was waiting I tried again and got the confirmation code. This took me to a screen where I could select one of two accounts. I arbitrarily chose the Roth and completed the login. But when I tried to locate my Traditional IRA I couldn't find it anywhere. I found no place to search for the account # (I had photographed the screen that showed both). I was able to request liquidation of the Roth, but still couldn’t find the Traditional. I posted a request for help on the portal which went unanswered, but after I posted this review with 2 stars I quickly received a phone call and email offering help. A VERY helpful representative walked me through a process to link my second account, and apologetically admitted that their system does not allow for setting up a portal with multiple accounts without contacting their Tech Support. SO: All’s we’ll that ends well, but only 4 stars for a system that cannot set up multiple accounts without tech support. And the schedule of fees to do every little thing still seems excessive to me."

I told her what I needed and she emailed me all the instructions I needed to get my funds. Amazing customer service!!"
Arika P.,"Customer service associate was helpful at a minimum - patient when requesting information to be able to verify my account, but also sounded bored and very monotone. While I myself work in Customer Care and understand there is only so much you need to express, I hope the call is reviewed and the associate is given some guidance for better assistance moving forward."
Priscilla M,The customer service reps I’ve talked to are helpful and pleasant. But this companies processes are slow and inaccurate and it has taken forever to process a rollover. This is frustrating and unnecessary.

I have switched jobs and my 401 k was transferred to this place, I’m a younge adult and have no idea what’s going on with the money I have worked so hard for ! I’m beyond highly upset to think the kind of customer service was even right ! I had a male answer the phone and he was completely rushing me and I had so many questions because I haven’t ever had a 401 k before and for me to understand what is going on with my 401k both of the representatives were just huffing and puffing at me as if I was on their nerves. I still didn’t get no answers for any thing I was concerned with ! The women who hung up on me stated her name was Judy ! I need to get ahold of cooperate please someone please send me the number idk what’s going on with money I have worked hard to build and now I’m highly lost at words and worried! This company has to be a fraud ! I’m contacting my attorney ASAP !"

There was a clerical error, I gave them what they needed, and I still have not been given fair service. I'm not sure if this has something to do with the fact that I'm a black woman. But they don't seem to want to give me fair service, and maybe that has something to do with the color of my skin."
RICHARD PADILLA,Very good company. Customer service was very helpful on the phone.
SHAKOYA JENKINS,My Customer Service Rep was named Alicia and she was wonderful and extremely knowledgeable  in answering my questions. She had a great sense of humor and really gave our conversation a personal touch… THANK YOU ALICIA!

Patricia,I didn’t have this account for long and only dealt with one customer service rep but she did a great job. She explained the process to me and all while adding a great laugh.
KRISTEN S.,They are helpful enough but the whole process highlights how frustrating mainstream money institutions can be. They have all the downsides and also barebones offerings. DeFi is going to destroy this business model.
J Reece,"The customer service representative talked down to me like I was stupid, he had absolutely no patience and provided minimal assistance. When I told him that he said I dispute that cause I’m giving you information, he wasn’t helpful, he was condescending and rude! My internet wasn’t fast enough for him and he acted like he had no time to wait!! Totally inappropriate!!"

I followed all instructions and was basically told ""Don't call us, we'll call you"". Which is fine, it's just been a week with no info.

RICHARD GUIDRY,It was difficult to be connected to a live representative. There were numerous attepts to navigate through the new user portal to register. The web issues necessitated 4 calls to Millenium. The repswere in a hurry to end the call and their patience ran thin with answering my questions or giving me guidance. I will say the last representative did stay on the line walking me through each line on a form I was trying to complete and it was 20 minutes until Millenium was due to close for the night.

JEFFREY CHRISTIAN,Great service Very helpful with everything.Thank you.
Five minute customer,"Whenever I dealt with someone there, it was great. The problem was my old company put our money with you guys, and I lost money while it was with you.

I was shocked and pleased that there was money remaining in my account. Thanks for your persistence."
Sonna Stevenson,"Korey was a big help to me. He walked me through the entire process to update my information. I spoke with someone else yesterday, and instructed me so quickly that I got lost in the process.

JUSTIN SHECTON,"The representative, Linda, was extremely knowledgeable and very patient. She happily walked me through everything I needed to do and know."
RP,Got a call to clarify the transaction. Prompt service. Very happy.

SAMYCIA LEWIS,The funds just sat there not growing st allStill waiting on my cash out card
ISMAIL TISDALE,"My dealing with Millennium Trust was brief but highly satisfactory. The person I spoke to on the phone was helpful and friendly. The online form I had to complete, while lengthy, was almost entirely clear and easy to complete. And the final step--closing my IRA account and depositing the money into my checking account--took only about 48 hours."
RONDA GARZA,The process was seamless. Representative was well informed and was able to answer all my questions.
Jonathan Foerster,They handle the issue very well
DANIEL HUTCHERSON,Very helpful. Walked me through the process.
customer,Everything is good the only thing that I don't like it's the fact got to take so long to get your money
BRANDON GARCIA,"I had to initially wait two weeks to be able to access my new acct. Now that I've registered online and confirmed my registration. Which was a very long process. I was told by customer service that I can only get a distribution after waiting for my Welcome email that could take 1-15 business days. At the max time suggested that means from the time my account was transferred to Millennium, which I was unaware that was happening, I will have waited 6 weeks just to process a distribution request - which MUST be done online. For money that is mine."
DAVID PAIS,Customer service was quick and very very helpful. I knew nothing about how to manage my account and a representative took 30 minutes to walk me through everything and understand my options.
Caren Duda,Awesome - she helped me and gave me more information than I realized I needed! Thank you.
ALICIA PEREZ,"The perfect knowledge the proactivity of the support team, she called me on the phone and I realized that she was really willing to help out. She sent me the link to apply and I did it in a second"
CARLISHA CROWELL,Not sure what happen with my verification email.
JULIE GREGURASH,I submitted my distribution request on August tenth and was told 7-10 days I would have it. Called them after ten was told oh no actually it's fourteen . Called again was told it shipped on the 23rd . Still nothing after ten more days...now I'm being told there are delays but why wasn't I told this from the getgo . This was money we relied on and it's absolutely ridiculous with the run around I've gotten
PHILLIP ORTIZ,Experience with customer service via phone has been good however the online portal is difficult to navigate and login is not user friendly.
KAELYN HENSON,They were very helpful and timely in getting me where I needed to be .
JESSICA MENDEZ,Tanks  for help
ROGER WILSON,"Needed money from a 5 year old 401k. Eventually led me to these guys. Once I found them. It was relatively easy, to retrieve my money. The site was intuitive. And the people helpful and efficient. Took no time at all, to get my money back."
Customer Poison Ivy Queen,Nice people work good answer all my question 100%reccomended.
Ben Khurana,"Website's easy to use and explains everything you need to know. Short experience, but very pleased."
JESSEE LUKEY,BNDS WILL MaKE. Her dance💃
BIATRICE SALCEDO,"No ACH transfers is highly suspicious when they take 401ks from tech companies. Thier record keeping practice is also highly suspicious.""The funds in your ira have been placed in an investment chosen by their former employer to preserve principal and provide reasonable rate of return..."" That's a lie, as they didn't do this, they kept it in cash and even tried to charge me fees instead of paying me intrest or investing it as this quote promised. At least I argued out of the fees. ""Automatically rolled over into an account at Mellennium Trust"" which is against the 401k policy of my previous employer. Didn't stop Mellennium from opting to custodian the tendies.  I never opened an account with these people...it seems like collusion with Cognizant in my 401k ""management."" Trust me you can't single handily fight collusion between 2 cooperations though...The only thing I agree with is ""Take control of your account"" as they say cause these people are ""above and beyond custody."" Thier words not mine. Sus.I wouldn't trust these guys as custodians of a gym locker room let alone to custodian any real amount of money."
STEPHANIE CONCEPCION OLIVERAS,"Nothing to report! My previous company transferred funds to this Trust and I'm now transferring those to the new employer. The website is very well put together, you can transfer out the funds via the portal. So very accessible!"
HARLAN PRINE,I didn’t authorize my funds for my old plan to be transferred here. I was told by old plan they would send me a check. When I requested a withdrawal I was told I didn’t have anything available. Waste of time.
Thomas Schecker,"Seems like a secure, well thought out process. Still waiting for the next step-Welcome To Millennium."
NICHOLAS RASMUSSEN,Easy too use online and the customer service was great.
ENID HERNANDEZ,"She is very effective, patient and professional.Good experience for me."
JOHN GHAWI,This company did nothing to earn my business nor my trust.  Avoid like Covid.
ANDREW THORNE,"Since my prior employer elected to move my 401k  to Millennium, I’ve nothing but issues trying to access my account. I have contacted your customer support line multiple times, complied with requests to email a copy of my drivers license, tried changing my password—to no avail"

JOEL WARREN,They made the transfer just as I requested and all was completed promptly.
"John-Great Falls,MT",The representatives I have worked with have been very knowledgeable about getting my account setup correctly.
CAROL R,"Pure theft.I just found out that I had monies in an IRA from a former employer. When I checked the account it had gone from over $700 down to under $500 solely because of fees from MT. The money was in a cash account, no service was ever rendered. The money was just sitting in an account no different than a savings account. I pulled the remainder out of the account because I find this to be unscrupulous and would never recommend your company.MT, thanks for the reply that the account was closed and monies sent are coming. I know this as I completed everything on line the day before and got a confirmation. Again doing nothing but charging another $25 to close the account. Again, theft. Payment for nothing. I will never recommend you as a  service to no one."
ALEX LUCERO,Very easy and customer service was awesome
EMILY,"She is very helpful, very knowledgeable and patient with me in navigating  through the process."
LYDIA AMISSI,you stole my money i asked a lawyer and he told me to report you to the EBSA for fraud i just reported you and will keep digging until you will give me my money that i earn you will give it to me the bbb is in your pocket but will be one government agency that is not and there you will get whats coming to you
ALEXIS BEDNAREK,You have made it very difficult to transfer my money. The first person I spoke with did not speak English well. I hope to never deal with your organization again.
Ana M,Having a hard time gathering information on different retirement monies that have. The woman I spoke with was very helpful
HENRY ALOKOA,"Had difficulty getting onto the new website. Spoke to a customer service individual to walk thru the setup. She said everything looked good, but I couldn't get on the site. She put me on long hold to talk to IT and said they would call back. I am still waiting for a call back."
ERICA LOVE,I had a question about my rollover options and the person I spoke with Chelsea. She was incredibly knowledgeable and helpful. She walked me through the various options very patiently. Excellent customer service
FREDERIC BROWN,The customer service rep was super helpful and helped resolve my access issue.
Amy,"I had a long and involved problem to resolve ;  Natasha helped me to the best of her capacity - she was patient ,  professional and helpful and eventually referred me to Supervisor Myra who was equally patient ,  professional and helpful - and the problem was resolved !  Thank you Myra and Natasha"
WATSON GABRIEL JR,I called to have Millennium Trust send me a withdraw form  The agent was very polite and I received the form by Email immediately. Your service is excellent
Qun Ying Tan,"Once I finally connected to a human the service was excellent.  I was trying to close a residual among left over from a automated transfer from a Wells Fargo/Radio Shack 401 account.  The email I was given to contact never responded.  Visiting your website and trying to set up access to the account led me in a circle of prompts.   Persistence finally paid off along with changes to your new account portal.  Best regards,  Richard Eberhardt"
JEFFREY FULLER,"great job, so helpful"
Lincoln Thompson,"Very easy to navigate and do what needed to be done, everything I needed done was completed within 12 hours. Very appreciative!"

KENNETH ROBERTS,"Your service provider was amazing, very friendly and knowledgable : )Thank you Marda*"
Des M,"Had trouble with the website and ended up locked out of my account for no reason. The employee Mina, helped me so much. She was quick and very efficient. Not only that, Mina actually listened to me. She got me unlocked from my account with a temporary password. Now I'm waiting for a welcome email till they allow me to log back in."
LAURIE SCHOVANEC,"Fast amazing service,  was very easy to set up my acct and get the information I needed."
SHANE HERRING,Great fast service and friendly staff. Quick results.
MELISSA LISON,I gave MTrust 3 stars because my experience with them was both good and bad. Trying to make contact with the bank after receiving a letter was excruciating. I followed the letter's directions and registered online but couldn't proceed any further than the sign in. Called customer service and got the run around but was assured that I'd get an email in a few days verifying my registration. Never happened. Received another letter 4 months later and again contacted customer service. Hit the jackpot this time. The customer rep tried to get me verified online but experienced the same error I had previously received.  However this rep also told me the balance of my account and emailed me a link for the distribution form. Filled it out and submitted the form and received an email acknowledging their receipt of the form. Amazingly I had the money in my bank within 5 days!!!!! Wish I knew the rep's name so I could mention it in this review.
ALEJANDRO BAEZA,I had a very good experience the agent was helpful he explained to me the process and everything was easy
Michael C,Fast efficient helpful staff walked me through process in less than 30 minutes
Lauro Sanchez,Good customer service and fast in receiving my money.
OAI THI,My conversation with Jesica was very helpful
Rita Molumby,I just want my money
MICHELE GIROD,"They rape you fees when it's time to move your money. I worked for CVS and my plan was moved to Millennium after I left. They place these accounts in plans with retirement goals for that year, so they earned next to nothing. On top of which it decreases substantially with their fees.Would not recommend."
JOHN JESSE,They were great. No run around. I wanted to take money out as I don't work and didn't know what the future holds. I called told them what I wanted and they told me how. And they said 15 days it was like 3 days I think
MARK SUMMERS,Thanks for charging as many fees as possible even though my account was only days old
MABEL SCHMIDT,"Lots of paperwork required; maybe that could be reduced.Otherwise, responsive service and pleasant contacts."
CRYSTAL JOHNSON,"I am very impressed with the quality of customer service.  I interacted with Mira to address my issues.  She assisted me through what I had decided would be a challenging process like a boss, patiently and decidedly guiding me through completing the form requests, staying on the phone with me through the process."
BERT GIBSON,Accessed my rollover Account with Ease. However they had received the funds from my previous employer without even informing me that they had said fund.
Angel Portillo,Was given good instructions followed them easy
wiser today,I only was with Millennium Trust for a short period but everything handle by them was great!
DANNY VAUGHAN,"When I call asking for help - the person on the phone sounded as if she was not interested in helping me, neither she wanted to listen to my question. She kept on talking and trying to make her point come across. I hope I can transfer or take out my money so I don't have to deal with this again."
MILES DWAN,"Easy and offers help.,...,..................."
LEVENT ERKAN,Your website is one of the worst websites I’ve ever seen. The formatting is terrible. The process for doing anything requires so many steps and often times freezes. Your company needs to streamline your website process for everything like transferring withdrawal ect.
DOREEN CARBONE,Staff was very helpful assisting me with all I needed to to do to cash in my balance. Balance of my account  was put in My checking account  within 1 wk.

JADE,Needed help on how to do a direct roll over for my 401k. Agent walked me through the process and answered any questions I was unsure of. Agent was patient and helpful.
Katelyn Adams,"I am not happy that your company didn’t send me any information that you had my money. If I had not done some digging around with the previous company, called you and go through this intensive process of set up, I would never had know that you had my money. To top it all off I was told that I had to pay in order to receive information through the mail, Horrible. This all seems like a scam if she doesn’t know, we won’t tell and maybe she will forget.  I will be removing my money ASAP."
TANNER CHAPEL,Efficient and to the point.  Followed up immediately with the email promised.
JAMES R.,Great customer service! They are very helpful and eager to answer any questions!! Thanks for your services!

LISSIE WATTS,"Yes very nice people, completely help me with any problems I had,"
Ballance,"I am very happy with the quick response of Millennium Trust. I was a little unsure as I’ve not had any experience with them before, but I was very pleased at how easy and fast they responded to my request. I would definitely use their services again."
Victor Niyibatunze,The representative helped and provided good customer service.
Paul Benson,"After many phone calls and getting different info. each time I finally connected with Natasha, hope I spelled that right, who listened and solved my problems and answered my questions, checked with her supervisor, and I had my check in no time.  Thank you Natasha.         Gary  Tittinger."
ANDREW LEWIS,"Transaction was easy, great service."
ZACHARY DUFAY,I'm very confused by the two choices of reviewing my account. I just keep going in circles.  I do not have time to sit at the computer or call.  Monday through Friday 8-5 I'm working. I would like to withdraw my money.
DEBORAH VAN NIEULANDE,"Customer service was great with genuineness, not trained like robotic style speech."
KEVIN HAROFF,Lady I spoke to was super helpful and walked me through all the steps I needed to take to be efficient and get the things completed I needed to.
Alexus Sanders,The representative was explaining to quickly how to register. I had to ask him to slow down. He also didn't make sure I was able to create my account before hanging up. Was not very helpful.
CATHERINE WOMACK,"An extremely professional company, in which I would highly recommend for services!"
MICHAEL GILLUM,"To be honest, my encounter with Millennium's representatives were smooth, precise, articulate and professional. Everything were explained clear and simple. I'm lost for words how to expound on this any further. Thank you Millennium."

MICHAEL THOMPSON,It was a overall great experience
TYMON CHUBB,Would recommend
SCARLET MANCIL,"I have been waiting 2 years to resolve the status of my account.  It is lost on me as to why this could not be resolved faster. Also, I have never spoken with the same person twice or have received any emails on status at any time.  I am sure this message will fall on deaf ears."
Robert Pack,"Dear Sir/Madam,My previous employer transferred my 401k money to ""Millennium Trust"" after I left the company. When we saw the statement we got the very first thing we noticed was that we were already changed $30 for the ""Establishment Fee"" and $45 for the ""Annual Asset Holding Fee"" Out of a total balance of a little over $500. I asked my previous employer to transfer the rest of the money to my different 401K account by filling out the form they requested but they never took action on it. I forgot to follow up and when I created an online account recently, I noticed another charge of $45 for ""Annual Account Fee"" and $12 for ""Paper Statement Fee"". I decided to call customer service and luckily the representative I talked to genuinely cared about my situation and reversed a few of the charges from my account. I gave 4 stars just because of his professionalism and kind gesture. But, overall I'm in awe of how this company is getting away by charging an insane amount of money as fees."
Emily,The chat is only a multiple choice faq. Useless!
Willie Webb III,The process for a distribution was excellently explained and very simple instructions to follow.
BIENVENU KANTUNGEKO,Mickey Mouse Company. Difficult to take a distribution.
Calvin Beck,Excellent. Thank you
VANIEKA LOCKHART,"Very easy process, courteous people."
ASHLEY VERBEKE,"The lady that assisted me was extremely professional she patiently walked me thru every step and showed no irritation With the  number of mistakes I made. When I called I was extremely anxious due to not knowing the status of my account she recognized this and assured me all was well. She seemed genuinely concerned about me, I could not be more pleased with my experience"
LESLIE OSBORN,Well done. Very helpful staff.
Sandra Gomez,"They made closing my account and transferring my money so unbelievably easy. And although I won’t be using them anymore, I sincerely appreciate the ease of what I was looking to do. Thanks!"
KENNETH VEIGA,Your agent was very helpful and patient walking me through the process. Painless and informative. Thank you for hiring her. ☺
DUSTIN SPINN,"It felt kind of shady how my account was handled.  I left my company which automatically rolled over my 401k to Millennium.   Millennium had my account for over a year and never reached out to me about my account (not an email or letter in the mail about my account).  I had to call and try to figure out my account number, how to see my balance, and verify that they had my account, etc.  I expected, at a minimum quarterly, account balance updates via email or mail."
JENNY FEAKER,"I had to switch accounts since my money got moved over without telling me from my old work, plus it took forever and way too many steps to go through to switch. At some point on the phone they told me they sent an email for moving forward… yeah no never received any email, text, mail, nothing. I hope this gets improved so on one will have to go though what I had to. Probably worst place to ever go to. Thumbs down for this system"
ROGER LAMBSON,"I recently put in an IRA distribution request with everything plainly spelled out. I have made the same request in the past.  Each time, your people could not handle it without my talking them through it.  This year, I again had to spend some considerable time on the phone with some body who did NOT have the distribution request in front of her and to whom I spent considerable time talking to in order to get across what I wanted to be done.  Over the years I have been with Millenium, the fact that your people are not well trained and have trouble responding knowledgably about anything even slightly out of the ordinary has been a constant."
MOLLY GEOGHEGAN,Don’t like the 25$ closure fee; however the account closure process is easy and smooth!!!
TYLER M,The customer service representative I spoke with twice was extremely helpful and was able to answer all of my questions I highly appreciate the time that she spent with me on the phone and on line completing and helping me complete the forms I needed with millennium trust I highly recommend her assistance with you all and appreciate everything that was taken place in our calls along with the information given to me

Eric Barker,Customer was great and walk me through the process of what i needed .
Kat,everyone I was in contact with was so kind and helpful and I received my payout n the same day thank you for your service
LEAH BOTHE,"I found the website to be very cumbersome and confusing.  I don't normally have to call for help to navigate a website but this time I did.  The verification process did not allow me to copy/paste the verification code into the website and it took me several tries before I realized that I had to enter the code manually.  It would have saved time and frustration if this was self explanatory.  My purpose today was to update some information and I was rather surprised that the asked me to verify personal information that I I had not previously given it.  They were valid questions that I could answer, but were the types of questions that would arise during an intensive credit check."
MELISSA BEASLEY,"The person who assisted me was patient, professional and respectful!!"
Jamie ,Great service and clearly communicated what I needed to do! Easy please!
Tammie ,Excellent customer service. Website very easy to navigate.
KS,The site was confusing so I called in to speak with someone. He provided me with the most basic knowledge as if I worked for the company and should’ve known these things. I felt rushed through the entire call.
DEIDA THOMPSON,Lost money plus the system is not up to date. Scammers you are..
Leticia Durand Montaner,"Didn't understand anything, old employer transfered to this place and I put in my info trying to either pull or move money and all the website did was say thank you and lock me out. I didn't even select what I wanted to do so I have no idea where my money is what it's doing where it's going or how much. Absolutely horrible experience with no help."
DOMINIQUE THOMPSON,Great company very 🙂 ce and made me money
JENNIFER KIRKMAN,"My funds had been transferred into an IRA by my past employer, without my direct knowledge.needless to say that Millennium Trust made the process as a simple and pain-free as possible. I will be investing with them in the near future."
JAMES BIRDSONG,"Overall my experience has been not bad, but not great. I have a self directed Roth IRA here and another Roth IRA somewhere else. It's so hard to get money into this account. Why can't I just do an ACH transfer on their website like I can with my other Roth IRA, instead of having to fill out forms, sign them, scan them, email them, hope they don't think it's an e-signature and have to call them, then wait until the money transfers? I would put in so much more money if it wasn't so hard to move it into the account.Honestly, that's my only complaint, but I have to use them because it's the only company the marketplace lending company uses. Still, I've had good experiences when I call in.The fees are not unreasonable, in my opinion, for what it is (self directed Roth IRA). Like I said, overall good, but not great."
STEVE WRAY,The person that helped me was really kind and explained to me how retrieving my money from a retirement fund would work. I appreciated how nice she was since money business is usually stressful to deal with.
JOSE ZAMORA,Excellent customer service!!! So helpful. Literally turned my day around.
KAREN DUGINSKI,I am still a new client so I don’t know how well the company is yet.But as far as I know upon registering my account through submitting my documents they gave me immediate response.Thank you.

SAM,Took 6 years for them to reach out to actually set up my account after it was rolled over from a previous employer.
RACHEL DIXON,"Even though I wasn’t able to access my account online meaning it didn’t show my IRA’s correct balance, when I called in, the lady was super! She assisted me so efficiently, sent me a link and stayed with me on the line to make sure I didn’t have additional questions. Thank you!"
Donna Lucier,Easy to use and quick online management. Thanks.
TERESA,Excellent customer service!!! Stayed on the line with me until I was fully taken care of.  Never felt rushed and very professional.
AIDAN RYAN,It was quick and easy to speak with a real person concerning my questions and I highly value that. Thank you.
Todd Carpenter,Absolute hassle of an organization. Everything is handled slowly and with an excess of fees. Phone agents are incapable of performing account operations and only provide instructions on accessing the website. Put your money elsewhere.
SAN,Great agent. She walked me through everything.  Top shelf customer service.
Antonio Fletcher,"Excellent Customer Service, listened to my question, greeted me with kindness, and gave me great direction to help find my solutions!"
Yvette Kirkland-Perry,Super easy direct rollover.  No issues.
Brandon,"Your phone service could not answer my questions as to the account number of my IRA.  However when filling in the ""verification"" form online the Account number auto populated where I could see it while filling out the form.  To be clear I was told I could not be given my own account number because I had not been verified yet in completing the verification form (before anything had been verified) the number was available."
NOORA ALOTAIBI,Gwen gave amazing customer service. She was very patient with me and walked me through the whole process.
ESTEPHENE JOSEPH,"Awesome customer service. Was able to unlock my account while keeping my account secure, if that makes sense."
DAVID BODDIE,"Contacting them via web-chat or e-mail is basically useless. They just send you a link to the video that you more than likely have already watched.Contact them by phone, and it is completely different. I was helped after I got thru a minimal phone tree. The representative was professional and helpful. Fixed my issue and stayed on line until I checked to see if the problem was corrected."
MICHAEL YEAGER,Great customer service. Agents were helpful.
LAURIE ,This is a good company to work with very professional and handle any problem you have in a timely manner
Kerry,Money moved there by former employer. Two fees that I had to pay without exception and very hard to get the money out
MARIA GONZALEZ-DIAZ,"CSR team is extremely knowledgable, understanding and patient. I believe his name is markee whom walked me thru steps to create my profile. There was also a female I spoke to on monday morning explaining my situation and the need for help to withdrawal funds to attend my 101 year old grandmother that had passed that same morning. I hope you can retrieve the recorded call that was around 800am. She is an angel."
LUIS BARRERA,"Excellent help & service, truly!!"

JOHN MCGOVERN,"Phone service is very good, but cancelling a request for additional info within a week of it being sent to me and not informing me is poor practice. It was easy to clear up on the phone, but what if I hadn’t received the original request? It would have been a delay not expected."
TCIAN STROTHER,Great thanks so much for your help
Jennifer Hardebeck,"Awesome, great help"
Jocelyn,I really enjoyed working with this company they were helpful.
Paula Campos,So far Millenium Trust Bank has been exceptional at safeguarding my money. I trust them one hundred percent.

ABIGAIL GOSS,"I chose 4 stars as I spoke to a very sweet lady about my withdrawal but I requested my withdrawal urgent as I am in financial hardship and need to pay bills. No longer with company either. Need the funds ASAP. If they do this urgently I would say 5 star, but as of right now since no deposit received it’s 4 star."
Rashawn,Difficult to navigate system. Identify info was rejected 10. Horrible
Yk,"I am very pleased with my first ever experience regarding millennium trust. Their customer service is unrivaled. The young lady I spoke with is very clear very concise, articulated herself well. She is very knowledgeable about the company and what process I needed to go through to obtain a withdrawal of my monies. Very well appreciated."
customer,The telephone system was a bit glitchy kept asking same question over and over ... the rep was awesome even though I asked her the same question over and over
KATHLEEN ROSSOW,"Efficient, friendly customer service."
customer,I was very happy with my representative who assisted me in the final steps I needed assistance with. She went above and beyond to help me.
ED R.,The previous company that held my retirement account was much more helpful in being able to assist with calculating taxes and penalties for early withdrawal. All teh agent could do was tell me to contact a taxc professional.
Mrs Ty,The customer service was good. Thank you.
LAURA LEE ALBRIGHT,I received a callback and the issue was resolved.
DOMINIC FARACE,"I needed to cash out an old account, and went online and did so with few problems. very easy to navigate"
customer,Smooth RollingI'm grateful for the ease with which Millennium Trust made rolling over the remains of my old employer 401K into my current employer's 401K. The customer service was very helpful both times I had called and is the main reason for my glowing review. I wish I'd had the courage and sense to call earlier once I'd gotten everything set up with my current employer. I might have saved more of it from annual fees had I done so.
CRYSTAL CONKLIN,Thanks for everything.
RICARDO FIERRO,Helped me navigate there website ....very nice customer service.
VICENTE ROMO,"I never had a problem with anything until it came to withdraw the money from my account. It wasn't even necessarily a problem. It was easily and quickly available. It just wasn't entirely clear to me what would happen with the 10% tax I chose to withhold... Does it mean my account stays open with that 10% as a balance, or does it get sent to the IRS to pay the tax? I was very confused with this, but it may just be my inexperience with such circumstances. I tried logging in after the withdrawal and saw that there was still that 10% balance, so I just wasn't sure what was going on or if it's still considered an active account. If someone could contact me with information on this, it would be greatly appreciated! Everything else was easy to maintain and access, so a very great experience overall! I especially liked that they notified me with any changes going on with my account."

KHRISTY BORING,"An older retirement account program of mine was discontinued and rolled into Millennium Trust. I received a letter outlining my options for either investing the funds or receiving a distribution. I made one phone call to a helpful agent who answered my questions immediately. Then, I filled out brief, easy online paperwork to request distribution of funds. The funds arrived about two days later. Everything was super easy, efficient and friendly."
Paul,"Your customer service sucks!!!!!!  Two phone calls, totally different answers.  Zero help...now what do I do?????????????????????????????????"

JESSICA GATCHEL,"So I ended up leaving Meijer and received mail from Millennium Trust stating that I had an account opened and so I read through the mail and the website that was provided to see what this account was and what it was for. I didn't remember signing up for a plan through Meijer so I figured that I would try and close it if I could. I ended up taking the funds and transferring them to my bank account. The process was super quick and easy and the funds were in my bank account the same day. From this experience, I highly recommend this company."

MELISSA,I had called in twice and both times the representative was very helpful. The second time I called in to get a distribution and the rep over the phone was very patient with me.

KN,"I completed my distribution on line, the process went very well, had a question and called customer service and the receptionist was very pleasant and helpful."
MARGARET RIDDLE,No one was available to help with my issue
CASEY,"Literally the rudest customer service I have ever experienced. They try to withhold your money, can't give you any information on your own account and take over a week to verify your own account. Refused to work with my financial specialist and told me I refused online service even though I was the one who called and requested online service. Asked for the manager, she told me the online access is only a week old and they don't know how to explain to me how to use the online portal because ""they haven't been trained on it."" A complete joke of a company."
GEORGE MURILLO,"REALLY BAD. YOU WERE NOT EVEN SUPPOSED TO GET MY 401(K) FUNDS - IT WAS SUPPOSED TO GO TO A COMPANY OF MY CHOOSING. WEBSITE ASKS FOR THE SAME INFORMATION FOUR TIMES, PREPOPULATES WRONG INFORMATION THEN HANGS UNTIL I DELETE THE WRONG INFORMATION AND INSERT THE CORRECT INFORMATION. I CANNOT JUST SET UP AN ACCOUNT. OH NO. I HAVE TO ANSWER THE SAME QUESTIONS FOUR TIMES, CHECK THE BOX FOUR TIMES SAYING I READ IT, WAIT FOR AN EMAIL, GET THE MAIL THAT IS JUST GIBBERISH, CALL AGAIN TO BE TOLD JUST WAIT FOR ANOTHER EMAIL. I JUST WANT TO GET MY MONEY OUT OF YOUR COMPANY AS SOON AS I CAN."

She gave me a password to use with no explanation and when I asked what it was for, she said you will need it to get your statement. I haven’t figured out yet how to do a current statement or when I use the password she gave me. All service before her was great."
DAN,"I was placed underneath millennium trust group as my prior employer dissolved their previous relationship with Fidelity. To even enact a rollover I was told I must pay the annual account fee, as well as the closing fee.This seems entirely ridiculous as I am not underneath millennium by any choice of my own, thus the 1-star rating."

Paul,I thought the representative was very helpful and I thank you for your assistance with my questions.
Martin Currie,"Everything about your process is tedious, clumsy, and costly for no reason. It seems your goal is to siphon money and inconvenience people as much as possible from accessing their funds.

SONAM SAMDUPKHANGSAR,The process is difficult. Online portal doesn't seem to work and customer service is aware when you call rather just giving instructions in the initial start up. Even after emailing required information waiting several days for response or account access
Eva Howard Provost,She was very helpful the best employee your company has
RONALD WEBB,I think your company is a rip-off. I only had about $200 from my 401k and by the time I finished with your company I only got about a $35 gift card.
TABITHA BROWN,I had to pay $35 just to 'open' this account even though I had no plans to continue my relationship with Millennium Trust when my employer's retirement benefit ended and my funds were automatically transferred. 10% of the value of my account was lost in this process and then I had to pay another 10% just to close my account. I will not recommend MilleniumTrust to ANYONE.
STACY MAIER,we called 3 times first one the lady was somewhat nice then the second guy was really rude and mean to me because i could not remember my address and then the 3rd time we had a lady and she was extremely nice tryed to go out of the way to get us the money have not got it yet but she was really nice
ALLISON GOEBEL,I really enjoy the fact that you guys kept up with the funds that I put away for my future retirement honesty trust and integrity is not a common thing I have been use to in the past with all the scams people are doing in the world.  I have had trust issues with allot of people lately especially hearing how people are scamming and stealing to get by.  It is sad all the stories I heard lately with people stealing from people for their selfish financial gains while other folks work hard to make their ends meet.  Thank so much for reaching out to me to remind me of these funds it is greatly appreciated.

Robert Gonzalez,"Excellent Customer Service Rep but terrible service. Financial transfers occur thousands of times a day - all over the world. Some institutions hold money for a period of time to gather more interest from the $. Why should it take a month to transfer $ on a verified request? It should not. The customer service reps are not empowered to do anything except politely say ""tuff s&^t"" ""go f%^k yourself."""

Since I called empower on the 26th, to close my account and send me a check, I have to wonder how lancesoft directed the check to you in order to open my account on the 28th. This should have never happened and I should not be charged for anything at all.

JESSICA WACHHOLZ,"The system is not user friendly. Once you have completed everything, it took me a few minutes on how to log out. I have to call the customer service twice to understand the process to get everything done. I registered twice before I could move to the next steps and complete the process. The instructions need to be clear people to follow."
PEYTON KNIGHT,Still haven't been able to access my accounts
TONI RICHARD,Michelle was great. The only reason not 5 stars is the transfer of funds requires a check to be mailed to me then me mail the check to the other organization. Should be able to do transfer over 3 way phone call.
JORGE PEREZ,terrible.  every time!
ROBERT MILLER,The Representative was very helpful and walked me through the steps of the form.

TED SHEPHERD,"I find your website hard to navigate.  I was interrupted while working thru the request for distribution.  When I returned, I noticed a clock counting down.  As I hurried to complete my work, the session timed out.  Do you really expect us to read anything before checking any boxes.  Clearly, the second time was successful."

LASHONDA PORTER,website was not very intuitive and my account options weren’t very apparent. getting in touch with an expert was difficult due to automated chat system and I figured it would be easier to withdraw my account balance. Will likely choose fidelity or vanguard in the future. Unsure of how I even got here in the first place actually.

This required me to upload required identification. I don’t have checks. So, I found one of my direct deposit forms. Submitted that as well as tried to upload a blank temporarily check that was rejected as well. So much work when I have already entered in security info."
NICHOLAS DAVIS,Was able to close my account fairly easily with a bit of help from a CSR

MELVIN GRIFFITH,The person I worked with was great.  yes it was an easy change of address but he was courteous and helpfulYour phone system on the other hand doesn't deserve a high rating it takes to long to get to a person for an account holder.

David sent the instructions quickly by email to transfer funds to another established IRA I have. Will update after this transfer is completed. I called to request the transfer for my account and was told it would take 6-7 hours processing to begin the process. I would be receiving a welcome email that I would complete my request. I have never received a welcome email. This request process was initiated 8/3/21 for immediate transfer and has been delayed on your side."

Gayle,Fast service no questions asked
JASSIEL VARGAS,"This was my first time dealing w/ Millennium Trust and it was a pleasant experience.  The Customer Services Rep, Yesenia P., was very patient and walked me through the process of linking my IRAs to my account profile.  She also explained how my funds are not yet invested and provided an email that explained some of the many trading options.  Now that I understand how things work, I feel I'm going to give Millennium Trust a try.  And a big Kudos to Yesenia P., she's the reason I'm sticking w/ Millennium Trust!"
Janet,The absolute worst to deal with
NILSA OJEDA BURGOS,"Well, because I was told by a representative from the bank who originally held my 401k, “I would be issued a check on July 6th 2021, if I did not roll it over or keep it with them”. That was a lie. Instead, for some strange reason, they sent my money to you. Why does a bank send money that doesn’t belong to them, to a different bank???? Now I had to go through the B.S. of proving who I was and producing documentation, yada yada yada. Then I have to pay you $25.00 to give me my money that you’ve only had for about 30 days?!!? And I still don’t know why the hell they sent it to you....but thats bulchit too! They should’ve sent it to me. W T F? Are u people gonna send my money to a bank who I’ll have to pay money to in order to get it back? I’m trying to understand how legal this is...or isn’t. After the tax hit and banks like yours it’s a wonder I get any of it back. I guess I’ll have to do more research to understand the stupidity of a bank sending someone’s money to another bank, without their knowledge or permission, instead of just sending it back to them."
Catalin Lascu,This was a small account from a previous rollover. I never received any updates on the status.  When I requested to withdraw the funds the process was efficient and timely.

William JIGGETTS,What a bunch of clowns. Con artists who use mystery to try and lure you into seeing what is possibly your own money.  Rip off. I have notified the BBB
Walter Wright,The transaction history and details on the new Cloud / Web site is incomplete with history only going back to March of 2019.  I am missing previous quarters / years of transaction history and details on the site.
Debi Brown,So over this company. Calling in to speak to someone is useless; it’s been months and I still haven’t been able to move over my money to my new account. It’s not like I chose to work with this company; I got stuck with them. And it’s been nothing but a hassle. If I ever work for a company that would use them; I’d look into doing retirement somewhere else.

I did not wait for too long to get help and it was quite quick and the lady knew what she was doing.

DAMION GRAHAM,"I received no communication about my transfer. No text, no email, no call that I could find. Maybe you mailed something that I haven't yet received. Still, there was no indication of when the transfer would occur nor a confirmation of success. And NO ACCOUNTING! Why is the amount so low? Was there withholding? What were the final fees? I was considering keeping my funds with you when I changed employers and even transferring more but the fees are just ridiculous. I am keeping my money with someone who wants my business. Sorry to be harsh but someone in your organization needs to get real."
BRIAN G,Customer service is very patient and excellent.
PIASSA JANKEN,Banking done right. Millennium Trust representative was extremely helpful and kind. The account setup process was easy and efficient.

HIASKARA RAMALHO,Web site hard to navigate....and get run around trying to get my money out of my account when I do get to talk to human.....no income at this time...and disabled... Now I have to use reg mail service ...to correct mistakes from online problems...seems like the McGuire group must use the cheapest company's to do Business with Because nothing but run around between this company and their insurance company trying to get disability
Jenny,"I was not properly notified when my money transferred over to your company.  I had someone call me to assist with transfer of funds but I was not comfortable with talking to them until I verified who he was.  There are a number of people that work for my company that do not even know your company has their retirement funds.  Lucky for me, my money is not with you all.  The little amount I have will be transferred and I plan to not do business with you."
"Dr, Kunjappu",A family emergency forced me to cash out my retirement. This was very stressful but the customer service that was provided made things very smooth.
J. SLONE,"I had to answer the same question multiple times to sign up, and all I want is an account statement and a downloadable transfer form, but neither is available for me.Requiring users to download a file before continuing is also bizarre. If you want me to read something, just display it inline.Also, the signup forms look like they were designed in 1995, or more likely, not designed at all.And NOW - just to give you honest feedback, I have to signup for some account I don't want. I'm trying to do you a favor and you are sticking it to me again."
RAYMOND DEBENEDICTIS,My bank sent request fax to send them my ira rollover on July and its 8/7 you still have not processed my rollover.

customer,Horrible situation. I asked for a check and you are mailing me a debit card 14 days later. Awe full service
Jean,This company has a high annual fee. It is also difficult to roll the existing account into a new one. Other than that the customer service was helpful.

DEXTER MORRIS,it was quite nice doing business with you guys. Each time I called some one always answer to help out with any questions you have.
ALIX MARDUEL,The account representative was patient and helpful to resolve my issues and answer questions.
STACY CARTER,Very confusing. They make it extremely difficult for people to get their own money. I don’t even know how to get my other account closed so there goes that money. I think they do that on purpose so people lose out on their own funds. I don’t even know if I even properly closed my Roth account… how unfair is that? Why can’t they just make things easy on people and let them talk to a human being and cut them a check to be mailed to their address??? People are going through enough as it is these days aren’t we???
CELESTE FRENCH,I needed to redeem my account. The rep successfully helped me in getting what I needed to get started. Very friendly and knowledgeable.
KENNETH VAPHIDES,"My IRA was rolled over in 2009 into Mtrust from a job I had from 2002 -07.I had forgotten about it, however, Mtrust sent me a notification in 2014 that they had been trying to contact me.  In 2021 due to hardship I elected to distribute the full amount into my checking acct. Mtrust could not have made it any easier.  When I called customer service, a helpful live person answered all of my questions.  Thank you!"
DEANNA BERRY,Did not get answer that expected.
Emmalee Bowler,"This was the first time communicating with Millennium Trust and it was comforting.  I needed to make a disbursement and a staff member easily walked me through the process, sending me a link to get the ball rolling.  I got my disbursement with the week.  It was simple, and a great experience."

Milo Mayberry,"Money was rolled over from a former employer's 401K plan to this company. This was done without notice in April. This is August and I learned of the transfer after receiving a quarterly statement a few days ago from Vanguard which showed a ZERO balance and all funds were withdrawn. Millennium Trust is the new ""custodian"" of my account. They have had my money since APRIL. In order to access my money, I had to create an account with them and prove my identity by providing the kind of information that hackers love to get their hands on. The account set-up process was a real drag and only gave me access to part, not all of my funds. I then had to contact Millennium Trust customer service to find out where the rest of my money was. Then I had to go through the same excruciating process for a second time. There were numerous problems on their site and I had to repeat the process FOUR times before my request went through. They charge outrageous fees for being a ""custodian"" of MY money and also charge to close out accounts. It's really a bad deal. If you leave an employer, roll that 401K over immediately. Do NOT let Millennium Trust get hold of your money. They will erode whatever you have saved by charging fees. This is downright predatory. My money should be MY money. Millennium Trust should have notified me that they had my money and they should have proactively sent me the information I needed to access my funds."
Benjamin Gallegos,Very friendly and took care of my issue immediately.
JOSHUA SEYMOUR,It was hassle free to request my information. I was able to do everything online with ease.

APRIL CASE/ Woodall,The young lady I spoke with took a lot of time to walk me through the process of registration and setting up web page and log on to help with the decision in changing this account into my SDIRA account with Strata.    It took a while and she was very helpful during that time.    Thanks a lot

customer,My experience with my representative was very pleasant she had so much patience with me in completing my paperwork process. I couldn’t stop thanking her for her patience and kindness with me.
DANIEL QUINONEZ,"The service has been awful from the beginning.  Transamerica and Millennium trust should be ashamed that it would take over 6 months to process a transfer, and many people do not like to process everything online.  So what then, you should just keep the money..."
Clint Potter,"Generally very positive interactions w/MT.  Most recent interaction involved slow responsiveness to a wire transfer request.  I understand the current environment, but the time lag was unacceptable."

Tod,"The rep was very kind and helpful but I found out that my IRA and roth accounts were just sitting as cash. When I received my letter notifying me that my accounts had been rolled over no where did it state that they were being held as cash and that this was a self managed account and I had to invest my account myself. This is ridiculous and borderline fraudulent. The letter should state this clearly and upfront.  My money has been sitting in the millennium bank making no interest, no dividends, no equity for me for a year while it has been part of the cash holdings for millennium making them money. I am moving it to a different company that is upfront about costs, and what they do with my money."
CHAD KAYS,I had a great experience speaking to one of your customer reps on the phone the website was very easy to use the only thing I had kind of an issue with was once I put in to receive my money back I wasn’t sure I went through completely it didn’t tell me anything on the website it did send me an email a few minutes later but it didn’t put it on the website as quickly because he only take away I can give you other than that I had a very great experience
John Brown,The mobile app was a bit difficult at first. But in the end an overall good experience
roy,"This company is the worst. Two times a workplace I’ve exited sent these crooks my money. They charge a account open fee, a monthly maintenance fee, and all kinds of fees too numerous to list…. Until your Money is a shell of what you started with. If you don’t know your money went there, good luck getting back. If you get any piece of mail saying your money is here, GET IT OUT!!! And they’ll charge you $35 bucks to do that. Nothing trustworthy about Millennium Trust Company, unless you don’t like your money! EDIT: So then they call and harass me about my review? Ya know what, you wanna make me a satisfied customer, reverse all fees you ever took from my RETIREMENT and cut me a check."
KERRYANN,"Quick service, and responses"
KIA T,Lady was very helpful! She answered all my questions!
not too happy,all good in da hood
LOIS MYERS,"I do not believe I am subject to state withholding in the state I am currently residing in - I have not worked here and have not even lived here for one year. I haven't changed over any information to this state because I do not intend to stay here. However, there was no option to state this and use a different state.When I got locked out of the website, I called and got help from a very nice representative. However, when I logged into the website, it said I have no money in my account. I literally had to find an old email and click a link for a distribution request to even see how much money I had in the account."

KLee,The staff seems kind but it has been very difficult to understand the process. I have filled out a lot of forms but still do not have my funds that were wired almost 30 days ago. This is an ESOP transfer that is evidently a little bit out of the norm so I am trying to be patient.
DEBORAH IRK,Good service

DONNA GOSSETT,My call was answered immediately & all my questions were answered. Thanks!
Upset,Great great great
TIFFNEY COX,I continue to struggle with Millennium charging extra fees--- Last year I received a notice that they would charge my credit card for usual account charges in 5 days-- They claimed they tried to run my CC but my bank had no record of such an attempt-- this year I cannot find a notice that they were going to run CC-- The card was expired --would have been a simple fix-- but the late fee came immediately --  Late fees just seem like a pre-determined guarantee -

I really hope that she is recognized for how awesome she is and I hope this review gets to her supervisor.Thank youRob Martin
Gregory Mitchell,"Ridiculous fees. I can't believe my former employer used this company. $125 deducted for ""admin fees"" then on confirming the account, they take another $35 + 25 and then to get your money out, it's a $25 cancellation fee. Talk about a racket that the employee doesn't even get a say in! Terrible, just terrible."
PAUL KULANG,"They were super friendly, very informative & made the process really easy for a first timer like myself. I definitely recommend them!"
ELRITA SOUTH,"New to the company, still haven't resolved my issues"

Kwantesa Thomas,Needed help they talked me threw it step by step and it was on there in two day very happy with them
TINA POMEROY,"1. I can't log in to check my balance over half the time.2. It only earns .01% which means after counting inflation I am actually LOOSING money. I would do just as well stuffing it in a mattress.3. I have to access it through my retirement account (you can't log in to Millenium Trust separately)4. The only way to get help or support is email or calling. If you call you get a busy signal.  If you email you are waiting for DAYS.5. If you do have an actual emergency, you can't access your funds and they will charge you for that.THIS IS A SCAM! DO NOT TRUST!"
Flor Maria Mealey,Thank you for helping me out. I appreciate the assistance.
JOSE LOPEZ,Over all things are going well. The website gave me a bit of problems when registering but it was resolved

ERIKA RODRIGUEZ,The process - from online to calling customer service - was so easy and informative that I thought it was a scam. The experience could not have been better. One tiny suggestion: a general date to expect the distribution payment would have been helpful (which I found out was up to 17 business days when I called customer service).
STEVEN COATES,The website is setup to easily navigate and when calling for answers to your question they are very helpful.
JUDITH COUSART,"Terri was  knowledgeable,helpful and supportive to my concerns.I felt heard and in a  coaching partnership.Warm regards,"

LINDA FIORELLO,Had some funds from a 401k from a company that I had worked for 8 years ago and there must have been a smallBalance left in the account and it was rolled over into an IRA.  I revived a letter recently to inform me of this and instructions on how to access my account again and extract the money if I chose to do so. The online process was simple and I had the funds transferred to my bank account via a wire transfer and within less than an hour the money was in my account  Fast simple and I appreciate the professionalism and simplicity of how their system works and people worked for me in this matter

AMANDA MCDANIEL,Proffesionnal and Friendly
Michael Madden,"The site is buggy so that it made me have to reset the confirmation application several times. The support person I spoke to was very nice but didn't seem to have a strong grasp on the process, so that I had to keep inquiring about requesting an IRA rollover to a different provider and not just withdrawing. I appreciate the quick customer service and return call, but the site should support them and their work more!"
WANDA HANNA,i had a good experience with them

Brent sykes,I am trying to close out my account that has not gained much with your company and i keep getting the runaround! I ask for help bacause your system says I did not compleat all form and just keep getting a link to a login page to another company I have never signed up for. Nice way of keeping our money and getting interest on it and paying nothing for it!**************************************************The technician I spoke to over the phone was very professional and did assist me in getting my request completed. I did appreciate the call back from the supervisor and being able to vent my frustration with the supervisor. That is why I’m raising my score from a 1 to a 3 star. Although I do feel the website does need work and links should not be sent out the direct people to other websites I do feel I was handled professionally and courteously. I am leaving my initial post to show the fact that even though there are issues the company is willing to work on them.
Linda,I spoke to numerous people about my issue and they are all very friendly. However it wasn't until I spoke with the third person that I actually got the help I needed.

LORRAINE SARREAL,"Very helpful when I called. Also followed up with me thru mail and email, much appreciated!!"

Shona,"My financial advisor and i has spoken with a lady last week about a rollover. I was confused from the email she sent to me. When i called back again this morning, the lady i spoke with said i had been given the wrong email and so i was told about a completely different process. it seems like the organization and communication needs some improvement and accurate information."

Larry Shumbres,"Update: as the response from MT indicates, someone reached out to me directly and actually did take action to make up for the problems that were experienced. I wasn’t expecting this at all, since it never happens any more - changing my review to 5 stars as problems happen, but making it right is all I’ll ever ask for.They locked me out of trading on my account and no one could figure out why. They told me it would be fixed in 15 minutes and after 2 hours it still wasn’t fixed so I called back in and they can’t figure it out. Frustrating to say the least, I hope that it gets resolved and in the meantime I put my trade in with the trade desk and now hope that it went through. Fingers crossed."
EILEEN BORIS,Easiest Investment company I have worked with.  Excellent online system!
Karen O.,The person walked me through the steps of locating a document.
Pavel Davlitshin,"I contacted them to gain access to my account from a previous employer. The reply was quick, and the instructions were perfect!

Cee Cee,"Great customer service and very prompt, ease free transaction."
Cheese,Terrible customer service
James Doohaluk,Does not allow for a distribution from a 401k account to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA. Only allows a distribution to a current employer 401k or paid out in full (leaving you paying tons of taxes and penalties). They also charge you $25 a month for having an account and they charge you $25 to close your account. My former employer switched over to Millennium Trust without me knowing and I would not recommend.
GREYLIN PINA BERIGUETE,Very helpful and spoke English that I could talk too. He had answered all my questions.

JENIFER B.,i was told that the process is 10 working days. it has been 30 and i havent gotten my distribution.
JOY LEWIS,I was disappointed to find out millennium trust had been holding onto a small amount of money of mine since 2017 and withdrawing account fees during those years without letting me know that I even had this account. I just received a year end statement for 2020 which was why I made the phone call about this account.I spoke with Chelsea and I want you to know that she was excellent and extremely helpful. You are lucky to have such a good employee.
William K. Jones,I never authorized my 401k to be transfered to this company and now I am jumping through hoops to close it and being charged to close this account.
THOMAS DUNN,Outstanding customer service rep. Listen to my concerns.  She gave great walk through directions to get me to the statement needed.  She also provided what was needed for roll over.
Vincent,"Wow.  Where to start.  I'll start by saying they have always answered the phones promptly and seemed courteous and helpful.  But, in the end, it has ALWAYS been a process of running around in circles and making it impossible to get my funds out.  I inherited money from my sister 2-1/2 years ago.  She had a security in a Millenium Trust (MT) account.  We had to go through a difficult process (medallion signature) at the bank, just to get portions of the MT account into each of the beneficiaries names.  The bank said the MT medallion process was ""odd"", but they did it.  Fast forward 30 months, and the monies in the securities still have not been able to be disbursed to the beneficiaries.  We've tried working with MT and with the security, getting varying ""requirements"" that we still have to do.  But no matter what we've tried, no funds have been released.  My portion of the account has reduced from almost $4K to under $2K in that time, and MT has asked for payment for ""account management"" from each of the beneficiaries.  Bear in mind here that NONE of us wanted an account with Millenium.  All we ever wanted was to get my sister's money to the beneficiaries.  We were REQUIRED to get a Millenium account and having them make each of us pay for an account that should have been disseminated long ago is adding insult to injury.  I'm not sure if this is intentional, but it sure seems like it.I warn everyone here...pay heed to the many one-star ratings.  We've lived it and are amazed a company like Millenium hasn't has multiple lawsuits filed against them. (Maybe they have)!  I feel sorry for those who have their work IRAs, etc. invested with Millenium.  I hope they all can eventually get their money back out of their account."
ALLISON,Very helpful agent. Very efficient transaction
Norkhairani Baharuddin,Excellent telephone service from Jesse and very fast response time online.  Quite pleased.
Brad Nance,Thanks a lot !
NEAL NASER,I called because my company invested in an IRA. Agent helped me get logged on and explained to me in good detail what my next steps were.
KRISTINA PIPES,Great customer service with all questions answered. The fees are the only down side since other business' are able to avoid nickle and dime
Veronica Cherry,"Excellent customer serviceI am a new customer and had to call Millenium Trust for the first time. Not only did I NOT have to go through a lengthy process of ""your question is very important to us, please hold the line..."" , but she was super friendly and very competent. She explained everything I needed to do in detail and even send me the instructions via email, while on the phone. I wanted to transfer my money out, but now I am reconsidering it. It feels like my investment is in good hands with MIllenium Trust."
G. H.,"You guys were very helpful,  thank you"
Lisa Drury,"This was a miserable experience.  My company was the beneficiary of a will and the deceased entrusted her estate to Millennial Trust. The executor of the will hassled with Millennial for nearly two years before funds were partially dispersed.  Millennial was unresponsive, gave conflicting information, causing delay after delay (we couldn't get a straight answer form anyone, after dozens of phone calls), and it dragged on and on.  No one at Millennial was able to answer our questions, instead referring us from one department and person to the next.  I was forced to open an IRA account for my company (which I didn't want and according to my accountant, my Sub chapter-S company was not permitted to open to begin with) in order for funds to be distributed into it.  After MONTHS, the funds were partially there.  And then, after a demand letter from me that they be fully distributed--a letter sent by certified mail--the funds  had dwindled down to nearly nothing! Now the balance has dropped by thousands of dollars, and I'm told that I own money for ""account maintenance.""  Here's the exact wording:  ""Please be advised the your Account fees are now severely past due.  Please be advised that your payment in the amount of $131.46 is due within 10 days of the daye of this notice.  Failure to make payment may result in our resignation on your account.""I sent a certified mail letter to Millennial on February 26, 2021 requesting that the account be closed and that the funds (several thousand dollars at that point) be disbursed to my company (Logos Educational Corporation). I heard nothing from anyone, and now on July 15, 2021, I'm told that the account balance has dropped below $0.00, and that my company owes Millennial $131.46 in fees.Having no response for Millennial cost me thousands of dollars.  I would never, never recommend this company for any financial interactions:  they are non responsive, clumsy (no one knows what the right hand is doing while the let hand is moving) and they have miserable customer service.Avoid Millennial Trust like the plague.  They are a miserable, incompetent company.  Trust me on this.  All those involved in the estate distribution feel the same way.  All in all, it was a horrible, frustrating experience.  The company should be forced out of business for gross incompetency."
JUSTIN B,"Everyone is extremely helpful, and have given me everything needed to move forward with continuing my relationship with this company. Thank you so much"
TERESA GILBRAITH,I had to sign up with millennium and agree to pay the account fees in order to access my account so I can rollover the funds to my other retirement fund. Not happy about that.
Matar Samb,Great customer service and explaining details
Scott Nix,Very easy to get ahold of someone to speak live. Also easy to navigate portal online.

JAMIE SHEAFFER,I am not able to formulate my distribution.  I was told that it should be available in two business days. It has been six business days and it is still not available.
FREDERICK RUNGE,I received clear answers in response to my questions regarding the possibility of doing a Roth conversion with existing Fundrise assets held  in a traditional IRA. The rep gave me some alternative ways to do this to minimize the conversion fees.
ALLISON D,You guys help me out today to get what I needed and a deeply appreciate everything that you did for me and I thank you
SHARON MORALES,She was rude and impatient. She was having a hard time spelling my last name. We were having hard time hearing each other on the phone but i remained positive but she didn’t.
GABRIEL MELENDEZ,"I would like to follow up on my one-star review of six days ago.I believed that Millennium had improperly coded two distributions. It was more complicated than that as Millennium received instructions from investment sponsors that were incorrect. So I mostly fault the investment sponsors, not wholly Millennium.With the help of customer service rep David B at Millennium, I was able to get it all fixed. Many thanks to David B.I hope my recent experience in fixing these problems would be instructive to Millennium management:1) This all could have been avoided if e-mail correspondence with the sponsor would have included me ( the client) in the cc line. I could have weighed in on decisions affecting my statement instead of  subsequently seeing them on-line without any prior knowledge. I encourage Millennium to copy clients on email communications with sponsors2) Most importantly, my call to the 1-800 line resulted in the Millennium rep David B being invested in the resolution of my issues. David B provided me with his direct email address rather than a generic Millennium address. This has not happened to me before with Millennium reps. Without direct communication to a Millennium rep I am left with always getting a different rep on the phone and having to re-explain my issues. No more identity-less phone calls or emails. David B knew my problem and we worked together to get it solved. I hope Millennium can recast their customer service and follow up processes to allow Millennium reps to build relationships with unhappy and frustrated customers and get personally invested in fixing problems. The result? One star reviews turn into four and five star reviews."
Carter Flaig,"I do had an easy way to set up my account in your website, thank you for taking care of my IRA funds. my best regards."
WARD BOND,i was trying to transfer funds from one agency to MT. It required a lot of paperwork but I was able to get both agency personnel to talk to each other to make things easier
LONNELL COBURN,"Previous employer rollover my IRA accounts to Millennium Trust. It took me more than 2 weeks to gain access to my IRA accounts. arp@mtrustcompany - the ARP department, which is responsible for communicating with clients or customers, provides the slowest response in customer service in human history. You sent an email, you get an automatic response, and then you get a human response -- everything seems fine except that if you replied their human response, not only will you not get a follow-up email, but also if the process where something is missing or error, you will not be notified. You will have to write another new email and asked about it, and then they will tell you 1 issue. If your situation has more than 1 issues, you'll have to do this multiple times until all the issues are resolved -- and this is still on you even if you already told them your situation and everything that they needed to know, as well as everything that you should know.Phone support is a hit-or-miss. The most recent call that I have was tremendously helpful, but otherwise, the support is still subpar compare to any other businesses, in any other industries as well as in the same industry."

VILMA GREENE,Customer representative who helped me to resolve my issue was very knowledgeable and very patiently helped me out fully.  Happy with overall experience.
ALEX SAEED,"My prior employer rolled my retirement into an IRA at Millennium Trust, so I followed instructions to create a new user name & PW.  Then MT confirmed my new user account and gave me a link to access my information.  I went to the login page just fine, entered my new user name & PW, but THE LOGIN PAGE WAS DEAD.  NOTHING HAPPENED.  No errors or warnings or spinning wheel of 'please wait.'  Very frustrating."
ANGELA RICHARD,"I did not know what to do after my funds were released from my Teachers retirement account and placed in the Millennium Trust account. I explained to the gentleman with MT that I need my funds to go to Fundrise, and he sent me forms to fill out that I did not completely understand. Fortunately there was a statement in the email that was sent that I could go directly to the Fundrise account I had established for the rollover to direct my investment to that account. All I had to do was click on a button on Fundrise's web site to redirect the money from MT to Fundrise and no one told me this is what I needed to do!"
ROSA LEE,"The representative was knowledgeable, and quick to answer my questions, even my follow up call back was quick and easy!"
SHAWNEE TRIGLOFF,"very easy to do transaction, laid out very nicely"
Dr. Bruce Berger,"The customer service reps have done the best they can to help me when I call, but restrictions and lack of information (when it came to getting my distribution of funds) have made dealing with MT unnecessarily inconvenient.I have had to go back to my bank 3 different times in the last 2-3 weeks to obtain basic information that MT could obtain itself, considering I'd already submitted my latest bank statement twice. And all this with the impression that distribution could take up to 3 weeks once all of my documentation has been accepted.This appears to be the result of MT operating off the assumption that everyone still keeps a supply of paper checks, which I'd wager the majority of the active workforce does not. Re-ordering them takes 10-14 business days (not a small amount of time considering MT still needs to process the distribution). I was able to obtain an account confirmation letter from my bank, a relatively simple task, but this was not availed to me as an option by MT; I had to find out from my bank after my 3rd correspondence. In my opinion, much of this back-and-forth for MT's clientele can be avoided. I hope this review inspires the higher-ups at MT to look into this and adjust."
MARY BURGELL,M Trust is very difficult to navigate.  I'm trying to transfer my small balance to my other IRA and it's proving to be ridiculously difficult.  My financial advisor for my IRA account can't even figure out what to do. And the fact that you can't do an electric funds transfer is also a sign that I need to get my funds to a more reliable financial institution.
Robert Lewis,Thank you to Tim and Lisa who were very helpful in guiding me thru the forms so I can close my account. It was a great experience Thank you
Maria Simental,I received excellent service from Markese. I was trying to navigate through the distribution form online and Markese was patient and kind enough to make sure everything went well before ending our call. Kudos to Markese.
CHRISTIAN GARZA NAJERA,Good company who clients can trust and depend on.
DEBORAH TISDALE,Service is very slow to simply verify ones identity if not completed all at once. Real person hours are also a problem if one is available just before the representatives are out for the day.

Chris M.,"Very good customer service,I get help what I am looking for. Thanks!"
BRITTNEY HOOPER,Excellent customer service that provided me with the information I needed quickly.
Catherine,"Your website is a tragedy. For a company the heavily encourages people to use it, it feels malicious how unbelievably terrible your UI is. Logging in and getting codes doesn't work half the time because your code arrives AFTER the log in times out putting the consumer into a loop of not being able to log in.Edit to respond: the guy on the phone was okay, but it was a lot of roundabout to get there considering your automatic answer explicitly tells us to use the portal. Everything will be satisfactory once my funds make it to the new group."
CLARENCE RAINEY,"Terrible website, terrible customer service, terrible fees, impossible to get money that my company put into an account there out.  If I had a choice I would never open an account with this company."
JOSE MATEO,The Representative was very helpful and patient.
Sha-Ron Lee,"Website kept crashing while trying to fill out form, I almost gave up, will never do business again"

JOHN MERCER,I was able to get all my questions answered by Tasha. She was professional and able to help me with activate my accounts.
JASMIN MANZO,"I recently left my previous employer and instead of rolling over my funds I decided to deposit them into my account after several calls and weeks of waiting and waiting for a welcome email I never received one I had to send them a picture of my mail to verify my address after they had already mailed me a piece of paper to that said address that I had to verify for. After that I had to play a waiting game for them to verify my current address which I know they knew was my correct address it was very irritating and frustratingThat entire time I never got a call asking if I needed help or anything whatsoever after calling them two times on two different days I was finally pointed in the right direction after my verification process now I'm still waiting an extra two days for my funds to ""DIRECTLY DEPOSIT"" into my account. It's a huge waiting game for money that I worked hard for I shouldn't have to wait and call and email and all that t I should just have to sign into my account verify my information and then have an option to directly deposit the money into my account. I will not be using this company for any future services as it is just a huge waiting game."
DERIAN LITTLE,"I don't like that they charge us maintenance fee, we should be making interest not losing money"
Josh A.,Extremely helpful and knowledgeable customer service answered my questions regarding my account.
KENDRA,I had contacted Millennium Trust to get status on my Asset Transfer. The wait time was less than 2 minutes to connect to someone in person. He answered my questions (after checking that I am really the account owner). Very satisfied with the interaction and more importantly how fast I could get to someone.
TREVOR POWELL,Well designed and strait forward.  Looking forward to more interaction .  Staff was helpful when called.

MICHEAL MILES,Helpful and easy. Answered all my incessant calls with concise answers.
MARIA MORALES,Was told by the automated phone message how long the wait would be to speak to a live rep. It wasn’t that long at all!! Very friendly and helpful.
EDWARD MEDINA,"Having my money sit in an account for a few years and be charged annually was pointless. After deciding to move it to a company that will invest it, the process turned out to be a headache. I had to call back & forth several times & the wait time on millennials end was long & the service agents we'rent very friendly. They weren't helpful in the years it sat there, nor the end process either. I would not recommend them to anyone"
Steve,Hi my name is Luis Ruiz and I will like to thank you MT for your help today I am not done yet but I know you are there to help me if I need help. Thank you
No,My previous 401k holder rolled over my account without my knowledge. Millennium trust absent was very helpful in locating my account. When I said I want to invest some of the funds she sent me a list of funds and the fees that come with investment. I would hope to be able to do so one line but the website is not user friendly for me. That’s one one start was taken off.
Betty Barajas,Company I had invested closed Millennium Trust help me simple and easy.
Glen Thompson,Easy to work with. Took care of my needs!Thank you!

PENNY ROUSSI,It was quick and easy to get what I needed.
CLERISSA CRISWELL,I called and asked for assistance on combining my two accounts. They are different types of accounts. The customer service representative wasn't sure how to do this and put me on hold. After 15 minutes the line was disconnected. I tired to call back multiple time but after I made a selection the line wouldn't connect to any other menu or representative.
Dan Andrews,"If you can get a person...they are good....but the website is awful, hard to use and getting to a person is near impossible.  It's hard to get information on your money and the changes that are occuring.  I feel like they know they have you and there is nothing you can do.  Not customer oriented at all...but I think they know it."
AMANDA OLDREAD,I had a question about a form that I was sent and the person was able to quickly answer my questions.
JOSEPH HENDERSON,High fees and high fee to remove my money when I never planned to sent it to you.  My company made the choice and I now have to pay to get my money out.

Kat,"I've trusted Millennium since they took over for Transamerica and they haven't let me down yet. I've made two withdrawal from my retirement due to the pandemic and having to pay bills and the first time they were professional and quick to get the money in my hands. I'm waiting for my second withdrawal,  only this time I used the pre paid debit card option as my method of withdrawal, so we'll see how long it takes for the card ad opposed to check. Customer support is always top tier no matter who your dealing with whenever you call them. They're all informative and professional and always helpful. I recommend Millennium Trust to anyone looking for an investment or retirement benefits company."
MARK VICTORIANO,Found itThank you
ALEJANDRO TENORIO,"I was unable to gain access to my funds for a roll over.  You want this done online, with a code sent to my phone but the code didn't arrive until we had given up maybe 15 minutes later.  I tried another day with worse results.  Only then did you explain that it could be done by mail."
WILLIAM QUALLS IV,You could do a better job of letting me know what my Quarterly statement is and how to properly add to it!

CANDON YOUNG,"Great service and excellent staff, very helpful and friendly."

DEBORAH WARE,I filled out the form and answered the required questions. The only thing that took a little bit of time is figuring out the best way to send a copy of my drive license.

RAIED FARHAT,"Very attentive,caring,and professional to the questions I had about my account and very helpful!"
DANITA SAPP,My original post was unfair.  While they do have significant fees if you have small amounts transferred in fairness they reached out and explained i would not be charged the fees since I immediately canceled my account so I corrected my comments.
TAMARA WILLIAMS,Millennium is a very good company to go through if you want to invest in a retirement fund. They are very helpful and friendly. They have patience and always respond back quickly.
Jack Viramontes,For someone very inexperienced with this type of process the website seems pretty easy to use. Obviously this is contingent on my withdrawal going through flawlessly but so far so good
WILLIE MCAFEE,"My first interaction with Millennium was through their customer service department. The agent was very friendly and knowledgeable, even to the point of anticipating  my next question. The best part was, everything they told me was accurate and happened exactly when they said it would! The website is very use friendly as well."
ROGER BREAKSPEAR,The fees are crazy for someone who only has 2500 in cash and not invested

LAURA ALLEN-MOELLER,"In the first place i thought I'd already lost my money on IRA cause i never reached out to them since i received the mail on 2020 and this year i just got an email from them that if i want to claim my contribution of my previous employer and i said i wanna give it a try and i got some help from one of their agent and yeah they helped me through the process and it's fast and easy, they did a great job.."
Socorro Acosta,Just good for future investment.
MAURICE THOMAS,During this pandemic money has been tight. I had an old Ira account that I decided to pull from. The process was super easy.
JULIE SIVERHUS,"Millennium seems to make their money through the involuntary transfer of retirement plans from one company to theirs. They also seem to intentionally place many roadblocks in their customer service to discourage you from following up on transferring your money. My 401K was very small as it was only a couple of months old when I changed jobs. Even so it is my money. It’s taken me several months to get access to my money, After it was transferred to them without my permission. (That’s another story). Incidentally my money performed very poorly with millennium compared to where I had it and where I was wanting it transferred. On a couple of thousand dollar balance it cost me a few hundred dollars."
CHRIS M,The representative on the phone was very helpful All of my questions were answered My distribution is complete
Ryan Fary,Fantastic customer service- everyone I spoke with was really helpful answering my questions and explaining really well!
JONATHAN YURKANIS,I called to close my account and the agent let me know exactly how to go about it
TREVOR CARLSON,"Melody at Millennium Trust was Outstanding this morning. Truly professional, prompt, courteous, competent -- you name it -- she was Great! Will heartily recommend MT based on my experience overall and in particular with Melody's deft handling of my customer call this morning. Sincerely, Richard Roche"
Blessings,Very helpful and easy to use once explained by the representative who was extremely professional.
Miriam Rivera,"The representatives don't care and give out the wrong information. I spoke to someone named Kenyatta, who was very aloof on the phone, and not very attentive. There was a weird pause before answering any questions, so long and inappropriate that I would say hello thinking we were disconnected. Her tone indicated she couldn't care less. When I asked her if everything was ok and if she could hear me there was an even longer delay. When I asked her direct questions about disbursement times and options and told me  up to 7 days to receive a paper check. I found out after waiting 7 days that that was not true. Their process for processing paper checks is 17 days. SMH. I am in such a tight spot financially and in a position of need very time sensitive. Her dissemination if incorrect information has effected me greatly. The time I have waited has has caused me to be in a position of lack now. She was not the only one who gave me incorrect information. The representative I spoke with after the fact also reiterated the same time frame for a check disbursement. It wasn't until I spoke with someone named Chandra that I was told the wait time is 17 days just for processing forget delivery. All of this confusion could have been avoided had I been given viable, correct information from the representative. This has been a terrible experience."
CINDY WOOLEY,Not easy to work with in doing anything. I called and wanted to take care of a transfer over the phone which I have been able to do at other institutions with my 401k  very easily and millennium trust would not do anything over the phone. I had to fill out way more paperwork than was necessary to make a simple transfer and it was a big waste of time dealing with any customer service representative.
RITA QUINN,Convenient and efficient. Quick and painless.
LAX,The person was very knowledgeable and helpful.
VICTORIA MATUS,"Super easy process, great customer service."
TIFFANY SYNELNIKOV,Thanks for being very helpful in growing my investments
MARK BORDA,Terrible experience…. Horrible customer service
CASEY GOODNER,I completed the paperwork for the transfer of funds and also requested that I receive a notification that the paperwork was received and haven't heard from anyone. Thank you
HAYDEN OGG,I would rate higher  however I asked the person I spoke with about fees. She said there none and I was charged $25.00
ZW,Very easy to use website and great call center reps.
STEVE LUC,Excellent service provided from a very well trusted company!Thank you Millennium Trust !!!
EDWARD LOMAX,"The overall experience was great. I called in and the reps were knowledgable, kind, and smart. The overall UI was simple and intuitive. It only took a few minutes to accomplish everything. The link with my bank was instantaneous and easy. Some technical financial terms could have been more clearly explained to the laymen upfront but it didn't influence the overall process."
HARRIET RUSSO,"Too much of a pain to do a simple transfer. Not my first transfer, but my most difficult."
NATALIE VAZQUEZ,"I called regarding help with distribution of what was an embarrassingly tiny amount from my previous employer. I was pleasantly surprised to be treated with respect,  and the same amount of professionalism as if I were a client with a multi-million dollar portfolio! Very nice company!"
MARYL SMITH,Horrible company nickel and dime me in bs unnecessary unreasonable fees and make it almost impossible to withdraw money to move to current company
LON ISAACSON,Terrific service. Thank you.
TIFFANY,A+ customer service! I hate that I had to withdraw funds. She was very pleasant and patient. She knows her way through the website and made this  procedure easier.
Andres Landa,Emailed a question in last week and still haven’t received a response/call back.I was also advised to send personal identification information over a non-secured email….
happy,Difficult site but the guy that helped me was great

DESIREE SMITH,5 star service easy quick and efficient
BRANDON MATTHEWS,Great experience and received the best help possible 😊 customer service friendly and answers all questions 😀
Daniel Mills,"Absolutely the worst company I have ever had to deal with.  Took forever just to figure out how to talk with someone and then when I actually did get to talk to a person they refused to help me instead sending me to a website that I had already been on and didn't help me the first time.  After calling back 3 times finally got a person to give me a number to fax something to them, not knowing if anyone will actually ever get the fax.  All for an account that has $1100 in it.  I can only imagine what would happen if there was 100k or 1 million in there."
Richard Allison,"I called to cash out my moms 401K and the customer service person did a great job of explaining how I can submit my request via the internet.  Once I was online, the process was really easy.  The form to submit the request did not take long at all and was not confusing."
Joe Newman,Quick response time.  Thank you.
Michelle Dougherty,It’s ridiculous that I couldn’t process my request to close my account over the phone. I’m not even sure that I filled the online form out properly
YVETTE HALL,"They were knowledgeable, service was quick, they had the information I needed."
MARK FUTCH,Very helpful with getting small issues resolved.

WILLIAM MARTIR,Not helpful and rude.  Try to help your clients through your web. Have called twice and will now have to wait again.
TAMARA CHRISTIANSEN,"I like how fast, informative, and professional things went. Doing all that I needed from my phone was the best part."
KENYA FONTENOT,The cash out / transfer process was easily and timely. Very satisfied
JAMES ZAMBARELLI,Nelly was more than helpful and stayed on the phone w me to ensure everything went smoothly Called at 9am had money deposited into account literally 5-10 mins after getting off call
IL,I needed help with my account. Everyone who helped me was on top of there game.  Probably one of the best customer service experiences I've had in my life and I'm 50!  Thank You very much.
JENNY SOURYVONG,"So far, my experience has been nothing but positive. The representative I spike with was very kind and helpful. He explained what I needed to do and what was needed to complete my task."
TUESDAY MACKLIN,Millennium helped me with my misunderstanding about where my money went and explained it fully. I'd reccomend them to anyone who wants a full explanation of what's going on!
S P,Easy to use and helpful
LAGREEN WALKER,Great service. Thanks.
ADRIANA HERNANDEZ,There is no one to really help you. The reps do not know answers to questions. It took over two months to get them to transfer my IRA to another firm who actually answer your questions and help you make any financial decisions or investments.
Deborah,Out of many companies have worked with previously this company has steep fees. They do not make it easy at all to rollover the funds to your existing IRA. My advise to you is if you are leaving a company do not quickly roll over your account as there may be funds that are still not there in your 401k account like in my case which I didn't know till nearly 6 months later when the company I worked sent my funds to this crap company. If someone leaves the money in this account it could quickly be gone with their fee structure. Perhaps that is the reason behind the long process that they have in place so that they can maybe collect even more fees from people. Fees to have account. Fees to close the account and roll the money to any other fund and more fees on top of that.
John Thomas,"Requested IRA rollover, process was pain free and very fast!!! Great company!!"
ELIZABETH MCDOLE,"I called three times, twice in one day and then another day.  The first customer service representative was friendly but did not explain about setting up my account. The next two customer service representatives acted like I was taking up their time and seemed unprofessional like they were getting upset with my phone call.  I did not appreciate that especially the third representative.  I hope I don't have to deal with her the next time I call."
MIODRAG JOJIC,This company is great I called him today about my 401(k) for dispersement because of my banking with Wells Fargo I got the payment within hours thank you you guys are great
NSG,"Each time I have called customer service, they have been helpful and answered all my questions.  The customer service reps were always friendly and patient.  Made the experience pleasant. I would recommend them to others!"
Larry Shumbres,I am very pleased with the service and highly recommended her in job will done. She was very patient with me and waited until i finished what i needed to be done. Thank you very much..
Mjd,"They need to automate their processes. Takes forever to get anything done and also trying to get a hold of any reps to talk to is nearly impossible.  They put chat bots every to avoid giving access to live reps.  I needed to transfer my funds to another provider and the process takes 1 month.  Then MT sends an error to my bank and says that the MT account number I provided (which they gave me) could not be found.  Now, I'm back to trying to contact MT, and they only open to 4 pm PST."
CR,Everything was very easy to navigate online and much easier than I thought to get distribution made to my bank.
KENNETH FRANCE,Helped answer all of my questions
Pedro Perez,The overall experience could only have been worse if they lost my money. Every step one takes to access your assets in order to transfer it to an approved firm is made so tedious to complete online or over the phone that you almost want to just give up. This is by design. It is nothing short of pathetic. In order to assure that my request to transfer was done properly I was told that it was actually directed to mail the officially approved signed transfer documents rather than email. I could be more dissatisfied with their overall service and account access elements.
Satisfied Customer,The process was clear and painless. Appreciated
HEATHER BENSON,"The individual who assisted me was professional, polite, and knowledgeable."
Brad Hamilton,Everything was perfectly done at my request great service was provided to me on time
LIZANETH GONZALEZ,I was looking for help to rollover a pre-existing IRA into my employer's 401k plan.  The Empower representative was extremely helpful and answered all of my questions.
JOSEPH MANKE,"It was easy to cash out my funds. I did not want to do that at all. The process of transfering my funds was not made to be a simple task. I asked direct questions and did not recieve direct answers. I was told that the process would be simple to transfer my funds fom my account into my new 401k but there was so much paperwork involved and would have taken a time estamate for about a month to complete. I am dissapointed in the service I recieved in that department. No one was willing to help me understand the process clearly. I am a kind and patient woman. It takes alot to frustrate me. Finance is not the problem it was the customer service involoved. It was very disheartening when the several men who answered the phones were ""put out"" by my questions and was trying to rush me off of the phone. Honestly I am glad I no longer invest with this company. Not only was I charged a fee for investing with this company for seveal years. i do believe 30$ of my money was taken away from my account twice a year without notice. Not only that, I was disrespected from the people with whom I entrusted my hard earned money with. Good Bye and Good Ridance. I hope you crash during the upcoming stock market downfall. Like I said; It really takes alot to upset me. Crooks like you do not deserve to operate."
STEVEN HUMPHRIES,I had no issues trying to get my requested IRA transferred to my new account the people were very helpful both times that i called I only called a 2nd time because I didn't know all the information I needed to get the 1st call but after my new company gave me all the information I needed I called the 2nd time and was given the info right away. Only drawback with the company is they charge a yearly fee.
MIRIAM SHANKWEILER,Amazing customer service very polite and helpful no issues thank you
CODY JONES,Sierra was very helpful in helping me set up my account.
MICHELLE OWENS,It was very easy to complete the transaction. The link was easy to follow. The website was friendly. No difficulties at all

ROSEMARY ROBERTSON,"Confusing website, poor customer service agents, and no documentation of the distribution, fees & taxes taken I went from $890.24 with Fidelity Trust to a distribution payout of 747.24 with Millennium Trust.  Documentation sent to me for the paper application for a distribution was dated 6/16/21 but the postmark on the envelope was 6/7/21.  I know I mailed the documents for the distribution payout on 6/15/21 but was told that wasn't possible.  Finally I decided to fill out the online application form for distribution which was a tremendous amount of work and got a direct deposit to my bank account three days later.NEVER AGAIN!Linda Aloisio"
Phylis Weathermon,"Requesting my pay out online was fine, There’s just no real information for me to follow up on or a person for me to follow up with."
DANIEL ST GERMAIN,"Everyone was so helpful, patient and nice. Thank you all!"

Johnathan,"Millennium Trust is just a scam. Collecting all your personal information (likely to sell) and then charging you money to get the money that your former employer failed to cash out when you left the company. I asked my former employer to cash out all of my retirement because I didn't know when I was going to roll it over into new investments. Instead, they left over $100, which then had a $35 annual fee and a $10 account closure feed deducted from just to receive it. What a complete scam this company is."
Julie Barnes,Excellent service and the process is quick and easy.
LAWRENCE KONICKE,Very simple and easy to use. Transaction went over very smooth and was no confusion on what was needed to do.
Gail Collins,I had a retirement account from an ex employer and it was really easy to have the funds transferred out!
JOHN GRIFFIN,"Overall a decent experience, and the updated portal is more streamlined. I think the paperwork process for private lending/real estate transactions with SD-IRA's can be cumbersome, and it was at times with MTC. I am switching to a checkbook IRA LLC just for more control and to greatly speed up the transaction timeline. Of course I wish the yearly fee was less, but it seems to be on par with other custodians. When I needed something expedited, they were good about getting a document notarized and in the mail quickly."

No involvement from my broker, no forms, no fees, just a quick call and a check cut.  And, I spoke with a broker after waiting less then 5 min on hold.  Your process is bad, service is sub-par."

Ruth Gibbs,You help a lot I would recommend y’all to my family and friends y’all was excellent in helping me
CALVIN RUFF,"My previous employer Ascension Health mailed me a notification 2 months ago that if my account was under $5k and I didn't act, my account balance would be transferred from Transamerica to Millennium Trust Company. My total balance at Transamerica was well over $5k but I did not realize that my Employer Match account was separate, under $5k and therefore subject to this seizure. I saw it disappeared from my account one day and then i received a Withdrawal Notification in the mail that Millennial had my funds. No phone number anywhere, not in any mailing. No information about what had happened. I called Transamerica thinking I had been hacked and my money stolen. Transamerica gave me the phone number to Millennium. Long story short, it will cost me $60 and about 6 weeks - if I stay on top of them - to get my money out. Millennium ""invests"" your money in a cash sweep account which then charges you fees which may be over and above the interest you earn. Other investments will cost you additional fees to get both into and out of them. Beginning in April 22, the .20% of expenses may well exceed the .03% current interest and then a NEGATIVE INTEREST rate will begin eating away your funds. In addition, they will charge you $35/year for the privilege of ripping you off. It looks to me like a carefully disguised shell game but Its really more of a long term heist: fees here, there and everywhere. I think my previous employer made money off this deal as well. Act quickly to move your money out. Take the $60 hit in the beginning and get it out quickly. Do a Direct Rollover, don't invest in anything and don't request a wire. This will keep your fees down. Once they take their initial fees to just establish and immediately close your account, the next fee won't be until January although you may be losing monthly, depending on whether the monthly fees exceed the interest rate earned.  No company that has to compete for your money would charge $35 yearly to hold an IRA account invested in funds that returns a Negative rate. They can get away with this only because  people naively assume their previous employer takes care of its ex-employees and they don't pay attention. WAKE UP! Act"

CARRIE WILLIAMS,"The website was a little confusing going in circles to sign in and sign in again 3 times with several confirmations only to be brought back to the same page asking again for confirmation of my details. Once I spoke with someone over the phone, the confusion was cleared up."

The woman I spoke with was very professional, knowledgeable and empathetic to my situation. Not even a week later and my money was transferred to my checking account. Thank you!"
Chasity P,"Only reason I’m giving a 4star instead of a 5, is that I really did everything requested. I did everything on the website after talking to someone and updating my information. While on the web I was prompted to upload additional information, I understand that it’s for my own security but I uploaded everything per request and a week later I still had to call in again just to have a representative tell me they have nothing and I mean nothing on file about the documents I had notarized and uploaded so then I had to redo all the information again with the rep.

Robyn Bilauca,"My representative Mira, was excellent. She guided me through everything with so much patients. She was very helpful and sweet."

That's right, only $50. The rest was taken by MT for various 'fees'. When I called yesterday, I had to go thru prompt, after prompt, after prompt to finally wait & talk to a person. Then I had to provide the same information to the rep that I provided to their answering system. I decided to close the acct & then had to go online & complete several pages to do this. I will admit the rep I talked to was polite & stuck with me while I completed the multiple pages of forms. I am thankful for that. In summary, my experience w/ MT has not been good, & would recommend you absolutely use someone else."

DEBRA LEFEVER,I spoke with a customer service agent a week ago she was kind helpful easy to communicate my concerns with. And made me feel at ease as I was making a rather big decision
KARA ADAMS,17 days to give me my money and not even having a an electronic option is absurd!!
Nicole France,i couldn't create a login because the letter only had a partail account #. I had to call to get it. Once I got the # I still create the account because some code came up that said something was lacking but didn't give a solution. So i called again and received a direct link. I got in but had to verify my identity TWICE and then I still couldn't access my account until I recieved a welcome email. Maybe its in my in box now but I jumped on this to tell you your website SUCKS! Hopefully I can withdrawl my paltry amount of $ and be done with you!

The second person I spoke with actually had a terrible connection, with a lot of interference, and was supposed to call me back but did not even though she said she would when we were ending the call. Once I connected with Natasha B. her customer service and support was excellent. She was the most helpful and knowledgeable of all the associates but unfortunately could not resolve my request because their server crashed. If I was able to connect with her the first time and resolve my request I would have given 5 stars."
BUKOLA KEHINDE,Difficult to work with. Everything has to be so hard.
RICHARD GROTHE,"My 401(k) was transferred to Millenium Trust after job loss. It was really easy to setup an account and access my money. When I was ready to rollover my funds to a new 401(k) is was simpler still. Fast response times from customer service, straightforward direction, and a good UI. If I consider diversifying later, it will be with Millenium Trust."

I had called several time to the MTRUST customer service center and was not able to get much help here. According to T. Row they wired funds on 06/11, MTrust accepted on 06/15 and today is 06/30 still don't see funds in my account. Very frustrating and poor response and customer service from M. Trust."
OLGA DOMINGUEZ,My wife and I were wanting to start a distribution. Everyone that we talked to was very helpful. They stayed on the phone and helped us fill out paper work.It took us a week to get a fax through to them. due to no fault of theirs.But they checked everyday to see if they had received it. They called me and informed me when they received it. They are the nicest group of people that I have ever worked with over the phone. Thank You
B.A.G.,Fast and easy. I was able to do everything online.
JENNIFER WAGUESPACK,Thank you so much for all the help that I have received.
Haniel Ilouz,Your agents do not respond to emails that they ask you to send documentation to. They do not respond to follow up emails and when I called I had a very rude agent that told me my documentation would not work. So I have been waiting over a week for a response to be told something and it’s unacceptable that I had to call to find out information they should have told me in the first place so that I could get the correct documentation. So once again I have sent in new documentation and have I heard anything back? No!! You handle people’s money and have the WORST customer experience! I’m fully withdrawing my funds and going elsewhere. This is ridiculous.
Rod,"The registration process is outrageously difficult. For example, the requirement for characters for a password do not automatically appear when choosing a password. Then, if you don't use the correct characters, there's no message to say so. You just find out you did something wrong. Once you complete the form correctly, you can't get into your document until the next day. That's ridiculous. Each time you log in, you need a user name, password, security question answer, and a security code. That's more than all the other financial institutions I deal with. This is enough of a pain in the neck that I have already looked into rolling my money over to someone else."
LARA PAWLAK,The agent that helped me was amazing! She explained everything to me with patience.
Jacqueline McEntire,Very good customer service.  They were professional in getting the information I needed to handle business transaction.
PHILLIP MARQUEZ,MASHERA DID S EXCELLENT JOB ON WALKING ME THROUGH PROCEDURES !
STEPHANIE HARTLING,I had a small IRA with Millennial and when I called about it I was very well taken care of. I had my money transferred to my bank in two days.
Jade Firestone,A little repetitive when you register to keep asking the same question and filling in the same answer but other than that it was great.
PAE HALATANU,"Associate was very helpful, the documentation was easy to complete."
James,Found access to my account very difficult. Needed to get phone assistance.
CHRISTINA SANTOS,"What a great experience. Everything was simple, quick, easy. I didn’t even have to speak with anyone. We’ll done, Millennium!!"
DENISE RIVERA,"I have had a horrible experience with trying to access my accounts, even after calling customer service numerous times. My money was sent to this company without my knowledge and when attempting to locate it I have had zero luck. Very aggravating"
KAYLA LUKE,Not easy to use . To many question. I just want to cancel and cash out.
SHAWN BOLLINGER,"Your online sign up is not user friendly. When I finaly got a person to help me, all they could do was reset my password.  I spent 2 hours one day and an hour the next trying to get my funds dispersed."
Mary Lou Wooden,"Extremely helpful and kind, I thank you for all your help.Sincerely,Steve Gilbert"
DAWN ELLIS,Quick and easy to deal with
JESSICA GONZALEZ LEBRON,Customer Representative was very helpful and patient. Thank you!
NAFASI SMALLS,Some steps could've been explain better I went to my personal bank to transfer my IRA over. When I could've done it all right at home. My bank even offered to do it for me and was TOLD the customer had to continue the services which was just submitting the Direct Rollover form to Millennium Trust. It was too much passing the buck AROUND.
S. Solomon,the woman that helped me was very friendly and thorough and knowledgeable.  she was a pleasure to work with on the phone
MARCUS ,I gave 5 stars because they showed professionalism that I can appreciate. The representative was very informative and helpful with the steps I had to take regarding my account. Lastly they demonstrated that they actually care about their clients by searching for me and finding me which still has me in awe.
MAXIMO GIL,"please add in a stock ticker for investing. I would like to see the growth in my account in real time, not next day."
CELENA RIVERA,Not easy to get through your site.  It took me about 90 minutes… but finally it was success

MARK EBBRECHT,Thank you for assisting me today!
Anonymous ,Excellent job! Everything was done professionally with extreme courtesy.
SUSAN DIPERT-SCOTT,Site was easy to use and took security seriously which is appreciated.
CARMELITA HINTON,Quick service. Advisor was super helpful
LIZA ARMSTRONG,Great customer service! Quick to respond to e-mails. Quick service on requests.
ELIZABETH KRIEDLER,Millenium Trust made it   smooth process to retrieve my disbursement. Having the courtesy of direct deposit made it so simple. I spoke with two different customer service representatives who were both polite and knowledgeable.
GLORIA ARGUELA,I had received a deposit confirmation slip about money I had forgotten about.  I made several phone calls and finally found someone that could help.  The lady on the phone was most pleasant and very helpful. She stayed on the line (on speaker) and walked through filling out the entire form so I could retrieve my money.  Thank you for being such a great help to me..God bless you!
B. EDWARDS,Millenniumtrust secured my information the self service was easily followed I had no problems definitely recommend and will utilize again
AUBRY KESTERSON,"The rep was indifferent and borderline rude. No interest in what I had to say. I didn't even know my money was with your company as Iedt my previous employer prior to the move and send docs to the previous company Mass Mutual to receive my 401k funds. Glad I'm not leaving my money with Millennium, as I do not want to be treated like just another person on the street when my hard earned money is in your hands.I did get the email with the doc I needed( as far as I know) so 2 stars."
Alan Albery,"I had an amazing experience with this company. They were there when I needed them with quick service. As well as the customer service representative Marc ( I believe that is how he spelled his name). He actually emailed me to follow up when he said he would without me having to reach out for an update , and truthfully he didn't even need to.  I give it a 10/10!"
BELINDA CLINE,"The hold time was fair, but the hours they’re open our extremely inconvenient for those on PST. It also takes multiple calls to multiple departments to resolve issues."
Amy N,Very easy to navigate. User friendly with clear and precise instructions.
MICHELLE ROBLES,"I spoke with a handful of associates at Millenium Trust Fund.  Two were very helpful, professional, and knowledgable, and two were absolutely worthless and did not seem to care to help.  I would give a two star but one associate was extrememly helpful in helping me fill out the forms correctly and also regarding which documents to upload for proof of ID, address, etc."
NICOLE MILLER,Can not get anyone to help me get my distribution sent to me
CHENTEL FORD,"My old company transferred my stock to you when they were bought out. I understand you need to be paid for your service but for me to have to pay a fee to set up my account, monthly fee to manage it and then to have to pay to close it when all I wanted to do was get my cash out, which I paid a fee for as well.  I think one fee to release the funds without ever making me set up an account and pay for that would be fair."
AURA HILL,The associate was patient with helping me.
CING HAU,"Spoke with a lady named Myra.She was amazing! Also  was very helpful, patient and thourough.Couldnt have navigated the procedures with her. 10 Stars for her!Randal Boyer"
Joseph Rios,Easy to work with. I however am still waiting on my distribution.

KAYRA MEZA ALANIZ,Everything was good. Thanks
EVELYN AMPONSAH,"My old employer rolled over my 401(k) into an IRA with Millennium Trust a few years after I left them. I don't have anything negative to say about Millennium Trust, I haven't used all of the tools they have and I haven't asked for much help from them, but I have had two positive phone conversations with their customer service reps. They seem very nice and eager to help their customers, so I know I can always contact them with questions."
STACEY HILL,Excellent customer service and extremely efficient… most grateful!!

VERNON GIVENS,Navigating the account was easy but didn't like that an annual account fee was charged even though I had control of the account for a couple of days. Also a fee to close the account. These types of fees shouldn't exist these days.
GEORGE SAVAGE,Excellent service and great IT team - the application is very abs ui is responsive
RHACHELLE VINNIE,"I called for my account review, got transferred to another person. They never returned my calls. It’s been a week now. Noticed few service changes like invalid address etc on my account. Haven’t seen any increase on my funds since it got transferred from Massachusetts firm in 2019"
STEFANIE DAYTON,"Unfortunately, I didn't get notification that my 401K was being transferred to Millennium Trust. The result? I spent $50 to open an account with Millennium Trust, a company I wouldn't have chosen, instead of transferring funds directly to my brokerage account. I spent another $30 to close it, and lost more money in the 31 days it took them to process my transfer after signing paperwork. When I called, I was told that's just how long it takes."
TheBrain,It was a very frustrating circumstances. Read by yourself the emails we sent to each other and listen the recordings of the phone calls. I started to write about the matter and it revived the frustration I felt.
Jane Stremlow,"Best customer service ever from the lady on the phone, she went through the whole process with me, shoot I can't remember her name, milah I think.  So patient and understanding, we need more people like her.SincerelyThe tamale kingpin aka El Gallo"

JOLYNNE SLIVYAK,Very professional and very helpful agent.  Thank you!
JOE ,"The representative that was emailing me was very rude.  These aren't fun things to deal with so the last thing I needed was a rude employee.  Now, its saying to wait 17 business days....I mean come on...thats just ridiculous."
Jod Kaftan,Representative was courteous and knowledgeable.  He told me exactly where I needed to go on the website and exactly what I needed to do. He also offered his help with anything else I needed.
BILLY BUTLER,Melissa was very patient and personable.
Natalie,Very helpful and friendly representative saved me much time and frustration. Made my objective a piece o' cake! 👍👍
ANDREA GOGGINS,"I was notified that a 401-k I had with a former employer was being transferred from T Rowe Price to Millenium Trust. Apparently,$15 was left in the account when I tried to close it with T Rowe. I tried to close it again after it was transferred to Millennium. In the process, they helped themselves to various fees, including an account closing fee. I got $7.50. Nice racket."
Luis Marte Acosta,Very polite custer reps. Helpful in explaning the process of my account.

SUSAN Unrein,Requested IRA distribution. Filled out the forms. Forgot a few things. Needed to make copies and send back. But called and talked to Tanisha... She suggested to try it online. She walked me through it. And I received my funds within the hour. Thanks Tanisha for taking the time to help me. You are one of the best people that ever helped me over the phone. You deserve a raise..I hope the company reads this. 😊
DOUGLAS ELLIOTT,"Of the many similar firms I have dealt with, none are slower or more difficult to work with.  Waiting for days to get simple access to my account is normal for Millennium Trust, although not for the multitude of other choices, and for this bottom-rung of service, they charge fees that other firms do not.For worst-in-class service, they should at least be lowest-cost-in class.Alas, I will be closing my account as soon as they can get my money transferred.*Edit: I got the message.  It turns out it also takes them two weeks just to close an account.  We'll see if they can hit their own deadline."
KAREN FOSSETT,"The rep that helped me was incredibly helpful and patient. She was able to direct me on how to complete everything online, instead of snail mail, as initially instructed."
David,"All I needed to do was take a small amount of money that a former employer put into an account with your company and for that I had to pay two different fee's?  You didn't even invest the money, you were just holding it!"
Paul Limon,User friendly applications took awhile before my account was found. Still waiting on anything to know what is going on with my request
EZEAL YOUNG,"The person I spoke with launched into what they thought I was calling about rather than listening to what I was calling about. After we sorted that out, I did get the information was seeking but will probably call back to see if I can get someone else to confirm.   Confidence is low. I gave three stars, which is average, but know that average is fairly poor across the board.   Service levels have declined and expecting bad service is now the average. It helps to have lowered expectations so you don't get angry or frustrated."
JONATHAN HECKMAN,I called because I locked myself out when trying to log onto their website. The representative was very kind and helpful making sure to go through all of the security questions to confirm my identity. Once confirmed she worked very quickly to reset my password and gave a temp password to get me signed into the site. I also received an email from the company showing the few steps to take and change the temp password to a new password. Very professional and helpful!
SHAYLA CHRISTOPHER,My retirement was transferred here and after waiting for the money to arrive (about 10 business days) I was as able to immediately access it and choose what to do with it. Very simple process which I deeply appreciate.
Muriel Finn,"After the job I was working closed their doors, I never thought about the money I put in for retirement. Then this company found me years after and let me know I still had an account with money in it. I am glad they took the effort to find me. I would say this is a company looking out for its customers."
Erin Womble,I wanted to withdraw my IRA. I was not able to do it online.  I can the 800 number and was help right away. Very pleased.

LESLIE MERIAN,Was able to proved assistance and get me on the right track.
Jessica Johnson,I requested a statement be emailed  to me 7 days ago and was told I would receive it within 24 hours. It's been 7 days and I'm still waiting. This is my first interaction with Millineum and I am not impressed.
LUCY COOPER,"The young lady that helped me was very professional and informative. She answered all my questions and gave me insight as well. I felt very well taken care of. She was pleasant and had a very genuine, personable approach. I was a little anxious to start but she quickly made me comfortable. In a situation like this, that customer service is of the utmost importance. I truly appreciate her."
Hilda Ramirez,I received a notice in the mail stating that I had money in a Trust from my old employer. Looked up all information and decided to withdraw all funds.

Marie Dizon,Great folks! Easy to navigate around and get what I needed!
MICHAEL PALMER,I talked to two ladies today on the phone about rolling over my 401K and they were both extremely rude and impatient with me. I don’t know what I’m doing because this is my first time dealing with 401K issues so I needed someone that was patient to help me but they were really rude about it.
ESTEE RAMOS,"THE INITINAL ACCOUNT WAS SET UP YEARS AGO. PASSWORDS WERE NOT REMEMBERED.  DIFFICULT TO GET THRU SCREENS.  CALLED CLIENT SERVICES FOR ASSISTANCE BUT THE SECURITY QUESTIONS KEPT COMING UP. FRUSTRATING PROCESS.  ONCE ADDRESS, DOB, SS# ACCOUNT # GIVEN, ITS A LITTLE OVER THE TOP FOR ALL THE REST!"
RACHEL LOPEZ,"To Whom It May Concern,The only problem that I experienced was during the final steps of my request for the total amount. I was required to download the information, which messed up the computer. Why not be able to finish the procedures, then download the final steps? I repeated the steps 3-4 times before it finally worked correctly--it was a big hassle for those of us who have a basic understanding of technology/ computers, but are not experts. I received my check in the mail on the 22nd. Thank you for your kind and prompt attention to my request. It was the final step in the process that was the problem.Best Regards,Carl Long"
JASON SMITH,"My funds were just transferred over to Millennium.  They are not available to me yet to be able to complete my transaction, but when speaking with both Kyle and Tenisha this week, they were most helpful with providing me information on my next steps.  Thanks!!!"
CORDELL SLOAN,"Your representative, Shavona, was very professional and friendly as she helped me with my request for information.  Great job! Thank you,Ramon Cordero"
JULIO NEVES,"My css, I believe Alicia was absolutely wonderful!  Very helpful and courteous"
MONA MATHEWS,"Paperwork provided online was not correct paperwork. I was not notified about this.  I called to verify that distribution was being taken care of after two and half weeks only to find this out.  Had to start over which delayed the process.   1.  Paperwork process online needs to be updated.  2.  I should have been notified immediately. 3,  After having to start over this should have been expedited.  I am still waiting  6/23/21.  Original paperwork sent in online 5/24/21.  Supposed to take up to 15 business days.  I am now 21 business days into this and have not gotten a response at all.   Approved or otherwise.  Extremely Poor online service."

CARLA PAUL,"Was very pleased with the help I received, didn’t have to listen to a bunch of automated messages, and no long waits, the company I work for just transferred to this company so that’s all I have for now.."
Hassan Alreyashi,"High fees, low service.A company I had worked for as a teen handed retirement funds for former employees over to Millennium Trust. It was difficult to work with them to transfer the small number of funds (less than $2,000) to my current retirement plan.  What was worse was the $20.00 per year ""handling fee"" and the $10.00 paper statement fee.  I'm assuming the statement must have been hand printed on gold bonded resume paper by a team of scribes. If I left the account alone with Millennium Trust, it would have been empty long before I ever came close to retiring."
Paul Nannig,Telling me I have to wait for MY money. Smh.
MICHAEL ,"I called because I needed to change my address and couldn't access my account online. The representative quickly changed my address and walked me through establishing access to my online account. She was very patient, generous with her time and helpful."
JASMINE JOHNSON,"The lady on the phone was very rude. She did not allow me to talk. If I dared talk, she would abruptly stop talking and make nasty comments like "" can i continue?"" It was not a question, but was a judgment."
customer,Terrible service. Stay away!
LISSET GUERRERO,The woman that helped me was rude and actually not helpful at. In the past I have always had very knowledgeable and pleasant people so having her was disappointing.
SONYA BLACK,needed to withdraw funds from prev employer was guided to self portal when i wanted a customer serv rep to help in the process

ALLEN ORTO,"I received a letter stating the company had an account of mine form a very old job. After verifying my identity I was easily able to set up my account. I was able to transfer the funds easily and they were transferred within hours! I was very pleased with the ease of use on the site, and how efficiently it worked."
SYLVESTER GRAY JR,The online access does not work. Spent over 2 hours getting no where. Finally had to call to get anything done. Glad I closed my account.
Andrew Nolan,"Incredibly difficult to navigate, asks for personal information such as social security card pictures online.  No real other way to correspond or get them the material.  I would not put my money with them again."
LAVERNE JORDAN,The Company & website are fine. The only glitch is the mobile version of the forms are somewhat off.
SCOTT SMITH,"Everything was very simple, thank you."
Edgardo Rodriguez,Helpful and dutifully checked all identifying info. Felt secure and still helped me access my account .
SHELBY G.,I unfortunately have to take an withdrawal a few month shy of being 59and a half. The process was easier than I thought. I lost my job and California UI has a big backlog.

DEREK Maybell,Good service the last representative person so had was very helpful and patient.
Christine B.,"I spent hours on the phone and online with customer service attempting to find out the correct procedure and paperwork required to transfer an IRA. When I finally reached a CSR with the knowledge to help me, the website form I needed to fill out re-directed me to an unrelated site trying to sell me sales software...over and over and over again. After approximately 20 attempts, I gave up and downloaded the form and send it via mail. I'm still waiting. I also was forced to take my dispersement via pre-paid debit card rather than an option to have it direct deposited into checking or savings? Absolutely asinine. I didnt choose Millenium, my IRA was transferred from another company and I'd recommend you not choose them either. Theyre getting 2 Stars rather than 1 ONLY because of the nice woman in Customer Service who worked hard to help me."
JUDY BURKS,Fast and very understanding help me out a lot
EJ,"It usually tool a lpng time to tlak to a represntaive an then toa talkto someone who might be able to help.  I appreciated the assistance I received un thw POA department, especially from Nellie.  I was surprised by the flexibility of your company"
JULIET DECAMPOS,"Friendly, very clear, took extra time with me"
Cynthia,"So far so good. I received a card in the mail from Millennium Trust advising me that they were looking for me, to send an update. (Had an old address). I set up an account, completed everything online and am waiting for my disbursement. The message said that I would receive it in 2 - 3 business days. So, we shall see."
Marcia,I needed the distribution of my retirement funds. I did not have a lot and I had left the company a year ago. Person on the phone was very helpful and he guided us through the website. I was able to get my funds almost immediately after completing the online request .
retired,Imm not sure what to do to keep the check safe
EDWARD KEELING,"2 Months to transfer *MY* money is unacceptable.  This is just pure trying to hold onto the penny's of interest while hurting me by restricting *MY* access to *MY* money. It might be legal, but it's not ethical.  I will never voluntarily do business with you again. Should I ever find myself in a position to influence my business, I will do everything in my power to make sure that I'm not associated with a business that does business with you."
Martha,"Your representative that I talked to, I think her name is Gwen but not so sure, was VERY HELPFUL!!! She talked to me like I was her new friend and DILIGENTLY contacted persons [we spent a long time talking while she contacted who she thought are the right ones] of interest for my case. We exchanges nice conversation that would generate positive results. I, thank her, for her tireless devotion to really help."
Chris Crowe,Some of the best customer service people I have dealt with in a while.
PATRICK JOLLEY,"Okay but their process is a bit much. I understand you have to make sure you verify people's identity, but you hold retirement funds for people far far older than I am. I can't imagine how frustrated they would be going through these hoops to get their money, God forbid they need it for something important and they have never logged in before. You have to wait 3 days before they even verify you to get an ACCOUNT?! Then once that is over, only finally you can withdraw or transfer. Man."
LANA JONES,Easy to navigate the website
No name published.,Very helpful in getting me a quarterly statement and in a timely manner..
TRYON MITCHELL,Never helped me . Worthless company
GARY BREWER,"Very helpful, guided me on right decisions on my ira"

Shahonda Perry,"Thank you, really trustable,Fast response, and great service"
CTweety,"- Millennium nickel and dimes with fees that should be disclosed BEFORE ANY funds are transferred to Millennium—which ISN'T EVEN A BANK.- The portal doesn’t allow rollovers to other banks which necessitated an archaic phone call only to be told it would require a manual process. On top of that, there’s a charge to get my money out and close the account.- A rude and indignant CSR put me on hold only to disconnect me and I had to go through the whole authentication AGAIN. The phone call was almost 35 minutes and did not achieve anything hat couldn’t have been done on the portal if it was actually functional."
TYLER,My money was placed in a millennium account without my knowledge or permission. Now I've been trying to put my money in another account and have been having nothing but trouble.
G J Martinez,Great customer service.The Lady (didn’t get a name)that helped me on the phone was very polite and full of information.
MARTIN KRENCIK,"The process of my account surrender was very simple and quick, no paperwork, all accomplished online!! Too bad other financial institutions do not have this same system, they inundate you with pages of paperwork, often confusing and redundant.Great Job Millennium Trust!!"
Quinstella Penick,"All went well, most especially the person communicated with was too nice to me. I appreciate the great work done by this company"
PHILLIP BELL,I had no idea of what to do to get the funds that belong to me but I was helped by multiple customer service reps and the experience was wonderful the directions was easy and the help was great can really put in words how happy they made me
Gregory Lee,Customer service help step by step
DOROTHY RAMSEY,System locked me out completely called was disconnected twice from agents then on the third attempt was told someone would fix it and call me back never happened.
Ross Sneed,You're the worst and talk with you guys 3 years ago Sam thing I'm still waiting I still East your you haven't you haven't we have want to review and I still have not received my statement you guys are terrible
Mario Vankinscott,"I’m a time of need, millennium trust was there to help us out. And we’re so so thankful"
MILLY RODRIGUEZ,"Even though a year ago Millenium trust dropped the ball, didn’t follow my instructions to rollover my IRA, charged me a lot of transaction fees for no result, and follow ups were frustratingly inconclusive, this time I ran into a most attentive caring representative named Vibha who understood my concern, promised to look into solutions for the problem and that she will call me back by early next week and also gave me her name to assure me that she will follow up. I wish at the start I had worked with her or someone like her."
Fyzul Khan,"It may not necessarily be MT, it may just be my own personal frustration with modern on-line technology. I have called a few times and spoken with a couple very nice, polite people but the last one seemed rather snippy at my lack of understanding. I get it, I'm elderly. But my online access is now set up and we'll see if I can easily transfer funds from my 401k to my IRA. Wish my luck."
TERENCE MOORE,I called to clarify things and was told miss informed information about the form I had emailed. I then was repeatedly rudely talked to in a tone as if I had done so many terrible things. I'm not impressed with any of the services from your company or the transfer from my previous company which I have repeatedly emailed and mailed you and the other company about to transfer my funds properly in the first place back in March of 2021. It is not acceptable to treat people that you are providing a service to in this way.
ANDREW MITCHELL,"I called the line to find out more about creating an account to cash out my balance and the agent I spoke with sounded irritated because I asked him to please stay with my while I was filling out my info. It happened to me before that since this is a subject that I do not know much about, people don't have the patience to be understanding and resourceful to help others. He did not treated me bad but you can tell he was not happy to stay on the line with me until the end."
FRANCES MOORE,It was an exelent service when I called thanks
JACKSON LAIZURE,"Customer Service representative was pleasant, but brought up an issue with a fax that was sent to Millennium Trust from Vanguard. When I asked if there was something I could do to aid with the possible issue that would expedite the direct rollover she could not give me any solutions. She said that would be handled by another department. Also, as the phone call progressed there  seemed to be no problem with the fax. The left me somewhat bewildered as to why the problem with the fax was even mentioned, if there would be no way for me to solve the so-called problem(s). Also, the 15 day turnaround time for a direct rollover seems somewhat excessive in the computer age."
EUGENE MONTELEONE,"I was delighted with Jackie! Excellent customer support. I called with a request for a document, and she actually created the document I needed while we were talking! She took the time to understand my needs, then she gave me exactly what I needed in a matter of minutes. Very satisfied with the customer service experience."
JOHNNY,"Excellent customer service. Representative clear, precise, patiently answered all my questions."
NaTasha Jordan,Money never arrived. I have now reached put multiple times and my money still has not been deposited. My account shows that it has been processed 1st call to find out what was going on was told it had not been processed (even though online says it was) Said they would make a note on the account. Again waited for days and nothing. Called again was told it would be deposited by following morning the latest. Here we are days later and still my money has not be deposited. I am filing a complaint today with BBB.
THOMAS LACKEY,The transfer process was secure and seamless.
ALEXANDER BOYD,The Online aspect of the banking and investing was easy to manage and understand.
Creativemaw,Spoke with only two of your representatives for very different concerns regarding an account I had forgotten I had. They both were knowledgeable in providing information addressing my concerns and proficient with services I required. Thank you.Marni
JEFFREY CORAGGIO,The lady I talked to walked through the process with charm and patience.

Wanting Access Mymoney,Helpful and straightforward process! Thanks.
Marlen Jaramillo,the 1st time I called in the rep (rated as a 1) was short with me and kept interrupting me. He did not send me the links needed for my roth account and he did not send me a survey. I had to call back in and get another rep to send me the link to setup my roth account. He was much better (rated as a 5) and sent me the correct link I needed to setup the account to get it to link to the other. which I am told will take 72 hours.
KAFILAT OSENI,"Great company, easy platform and website."
ANDREW ANDERSON,It was a wonderful experience.  The person I spoke with handled all my issues and questions with ease and my results were better than expected. Much appreciated

MICHAEL MARTINEZ,Little trouble at first. Cleared it up
JORGE ALVAREZ,The agent was very helpful and answered all my questions. Thank you.
CRISTY CHATFIELD,"I attempted to have a partial withdrawal from my account forwarded to my banking institution. I would think that my voided check which has my first name initial and my middle name spelled out could be verifiable through my bank, no other information was requested other than the voided check. I’m sure I’m not the only person in life who uses their middle name. I just think a phone call from you to my banking institution could verify that the account was issued in my full name ( ID is required for  opening an account)  even if my middle name was on the check. I should not have had to go and get a letter from the bank. I was told that this bank doesn’t know me, I doubt that they know me at my bank (just another name). I’m really annoyed because I needed the money sooner than having it come by mail.  if I’m missing something here, I apologize for the misunderstanding and thanks for safeguarding my account."
COLLEEN,This company did everything it could to hold on to my retirement funds. For some reason they think this is their money. This company is a fraud!!!! They will take your retirement funds and never give it back! Lame!
Jessie Metohu,"Poor customer service and the software portal had little to no functionality.  I retired and ended with a few thousand dollars somehow getting deposited to Millennium that will take 6-7 weeks to get transferred and consolidated.  I could not get a statement on line, get my account number or do a simple transfer to my consolidated account at Morgan Stanley.   Representatives on the phone did not really care to assist.  After 3 weeks of phone calls, emails and trying to use the unfunctional software it appears this may be in process but will take another month.   My broker with a statement should have been able to do this in a few minutes electronically."
Joel Sandifer,Need a written signature to transfer an account? Wake up to the 21st century and start accepting electronic signatures!
DIVAKAR NATESAN,Good but need to get faster by getting money out to people
Mel,"User friendly, easily accessible thorough:)"
Christopher Dean,To much BS just doing a simple task here!!
MARY WORMLEY,"Erykah assisted me with getting my IRA Distributation situated. She was very professional, polite and knowledgeable of her work. Judy, her supervisor, also assisted in getting my online application completed. She was an expert in knowing just what to do to correct other associates mistakes who tried to help me in the past for the same request. I was extremely fortunate to connect with these two ladies and felt honored to have their service.  Please recognize them for their outstanding customer service.  Thank you Erykah and Judy!"
Shane P,Very helpful  when I called .
KEITH WOODBERRY,I still haven’t received my cash out money.Really how long does it take for me to get my money.It should have never went to you in the first place.Just received a call about my money.It’s been 2 weeks. They said that it is still in process.I can’t believe it takes a large company this long to process a payment.It will be over 3 weeks for me to receive my money.Just because the would not wire it into my account Not good business Would never use this company
RUTH ANDRADE,The process to distribute my money to my bank was fast and easy. The money was in my bank just a couple of days. Thank you!
Christine Garcia,I think it may be a good company to work with.It took quite a few months to get through the information to understand how  the IRA worked from Kohl's.The fee chart was easy to understand. Just needed the money and it had not made any interest since it was turned over from Kohls as an active employee.
STEAKS13,"This account was opened by a former employer without my knowledge, while trying to transfer my money to my current employers 401 company I found it very difficult to close this account. Always needing more information, I was told a copy of a W2 form would be sufficient, then told no I needed to send a copy of a signed social security card ( I sent this but was very uncomfortable doing it! )"
BARBARA CAHN,I would have gone 5 stars if it had been easier to to upload the pictures of my check and if I had received an email to show that my request was being processed.
CAROL R,Dav was very helpful with all my questions
BRIANNA JONES,Was an easy system to navigate. The operator was polite.
NANCY ORTIZ,The customer rep was very professional as she took time to walk me through step by step on how to complete the form. The rep explained further the steps after completion of the form and estimated time for receiving the payout debit card.
LEAH,"The Millennium Trust site is very easy to use, easy to navigate and clearly explains what it needed to complete a transaction."
Keith Collins,My questions were answered attentively and throughly.
LITITIA BUCK,thank you for the very quick and easy process
Laurie Denler,"I have been trying for months to try to get a traditional IRA rolled over to another company.  TransAmerica assigned my funds to Millennium, without my knowledge, months ago.  I have contacted Millennium 7 times to get updates.  First, they tell me they need something from the company I'm rolling over to.  Fine.  I repeatedly ask them, ""Is there anything else you need?""  Response, no, that is all we need.  I follow up with Millenium and they say, ""Oh, we need this first.""  I provide it and, again, ask, ""Is there anything else you need to get this moving?""  Response, no, that is all we need.  This has gone on with each call . . . they need something to initiate the process.  Here we are now months later and I learn it takes 90 days for a custodial company (Millennium) to begin the process AFTER they have received everything.  Keep in mind, they have told me they had everything 6 times!  Frankly, Millennium sucks.  Had I had a choice, I would NEVER have allowed them to be the custodial for my funds."
Nanette Levine,"Representative was very helpful and fully explained processes, procedures and timelines"
CANDACE GRAHAM,"The staff very unprofessional,and very difficult to work. I gave one ⭐ start because do not allowed me to gave 0."
GLADYS TORRES,Was surprised that Millennium isn’t set-up for wire transfers having to  wait weeks for a simple transfer of funds to another wire house but no choice did not pick millennium my last employer did I assume was the “economical” choice? Nothing against him personally but in today’s age of wanting things faster they need to get on the wire transfers.
Kimberly Holder Baibus,Was very annoying that I could not close my account over the phone I was forced to go obline after being on the phone for 30 mins with someone.  I then had to go online and close my account and give the same information to get this disspersment done. The person I talked with said legally they couldnt do it over the phone I would like to see what legal precident prevents closing an account over the phone seeing as I have done this previously with other companies in the past.
FAIROOZ MURAD,To whom it may concern : Dear Sir/Mam after finishing and complete the application for distrubiution of my IRA file . i would like to know the processes of this file : in advance please accept my gratitoued for your coaporation in that matter . best regards hassan saberi

ART RANKIN,It went really well. I was able to get info I needed. Thank you
JODY SCOTT,I only had $30 left in a account for someReason that didn’t get moves with the rest of the money. The guy on the phone was only willing to refer me to the website and unwilling to help. I am really glad you are not handling all of my finances with that kind of customer service.
emily ,Both Bailey and Stephanie were extremely helpful with guiding through the process
LATOYA PRICE,"Representative was great in helping me walk thru liquidation process, however not happy at all that there is a $10 processing fee!!! My total return was 4 cents!!!! Not fair!!! Just because J.C.Penneys was being sued (not my fault!) I should have gotten a full return, even as little as it was! I worked very hard for that money!!"
Sam,"Easy to use, and quick access tools."
JAMES WELSH,"Less than 24 hours, but thought it would be closer to an hour or two."
JACK MARTIRE,To early to give a bad review
ROBERT DEARMAN,very easy to make a distribution online. Thank you Millennium.
MELINDA PRESS,The whole process was straightforward and painless. Thanks so much!
KIWANI TAPPER,Everyone that I've spoken to have been really helpful.  The website isn't all that user friendly.  I'd like a more direct and simple approach to what I need to do.
NICOLE THOMAS,"Jackie was the associate who assisted me with my rollover process. She was outstanding. I had a hard time getting through all the forms but she was awesome about walking through it with me. On a scale of 1 to 10, I rate her at least a 15. She was phenomenal. Thank you for staffing with personal of her caliber and a very, very special word of gratitude to Jackie."
Rasheda,Millennium Trust personnel were very calm and reassuring.  It was a very pleasant experience. I feel this is the way money matters should be handled.  Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to let all of you know what a good job you are doing.
LAWRENCE BOTTO,I didn't even know I had the money. I thought I closed that account. Thank you for hunting me down. I really am impressed by the speed of service. Thank you
Shelly Damico,"Needed copy of 1099R form. Spoke w gentleman who helped me immediately and was very courteous. I waited 25 min and when I didn’t receive the form in my email I called again. Spoke w Erica this time. She informed me it would be sent within 24 - 72 business hours, I wasn’t told this on the first call. She then put in a request for a form by this afternoon. But she helped me locate the form on line and I was able to download it. Yes I waited to the last minute to file because I owe $$ on taxes. But thanks to Erica for all her help. Good job."
Leonardo Mallare,"The customer service representative that asisted me, with what I thought was an extremely difficult situation, was in fact a pleasant experience, and it was fast."
ESTRELLA BUNDA,"Kamila Plata was a saint dealing with me.very,very helpful"
Lori,I called to roll out my IRA into a plan that I have at my current job. I was walk through the process and the person on the other end of the phone was nice and helpful. She walked me through the correct steps to accomplish my goal.
MAXWELL CRABB,"Very easy process and easy navigation in the web, thanks."
BRIAN,The lady I spoke to was very helpful and pleasant
SHELBY WILLSON,"I spoke to  supervisor named Michelle. She was rude and decided to dictate to me (who had funds transferred unknowingly and I didn't understand the process) how I was supposed to understand everything. However, everything she dictated to me was not on the site the way she ""TOLD ME"" I was looking at it. This was a horrible experience. If you read this please consider it a zero call against the agent and supervisor. Thanks.Why would I ever want you to reach out to me again after being spoken too that way? I'll reach out and work to get my funds moved to a respectful institution. My money was moved without me knowing. I expressed this on the call. I was then spoken too in a manor that I should know you and your company. From my perspective was given my money without my knowledge. I advised this to the agent and the supervisor. If someone told me this from the beginning of a call. I would not treat them like they should understand you, your process, and your company from the first time they call. Speaking down to someone who is calling for their freaking retirement savings, being moved to a company they don't know is just not only wrong, but clearly a bias your company has towards people who reach out for assistance. Respond and sugar coat whatever you think you need too. Try and save face. The honest truth is you were in the wrong and after review. You know it. Honestly, if your reading this... think about if someone you cared about called me up needing help for their savings account from one institution read freaking zero and I (who they don't know at all) have their money and spoke to them with the expectation of they should just ""know"" and I spoke down to them. What would you do? If you just read this and work at Millennium Trust and think it would be different? Find Michelle and go express how you feel. Your coworker does her job differently than you. You may not for ""However many years"" she has been doing it. Caught it yet. Start looking a little more closely. You will. Making a straight forward statement of ""I informed you sir"" when someone calls in a panic and explains that calmly then to be spoken down too about how I should ""know""... and dictate the process as I am looking at a screen ""saying it doesn't say that"" or giving a response of ""Well you can just google it""... vs assisting is not appreciated. Its a bit concerning that such an unconscious bias is allowed to be expressed at your company. Perhaps, you think this is ok. However, it's not anymore. Especially, to clients."
TERESITA MORALES,"I don't want to write a review, I just need a statement so I can get my stuff finished."
ROSENDO CORPUZ,"My 401K was automatically rolled over to this account when I left my previous job. It was difficult to find any information on how to navigate their website and how to access my IRA. Almost nothing could be done digitally - physical forms for every move had to be printed and submitted by mail or fax. I had very little communication from the company about what was happening with my IRA. Overall, I wasn't impressed and it was too difficult to make any changes so I opted to rollover again to a new company where I have more control over my money. If you like to do things old school, I'm sure this is a good option, but its not for me."
WELDON SOUTHERN,Service was too slow
JOHN KENSEY,The website was very user-friendly. I had no other contact with the company.
ROSA GONZALEZ,My experience with millennium trust was average for one reason only. The process of transferring my 401k to my account is a bit longer than I expected.
RICHARD DAVIS,Easy to contact them. They have very professional customer service staff
Betsy,This transaction was easier than I expected it to be.  Everything was done online and my money was in my bank account within one day
LAUREN WILLIAMS,"The representative answered my questions. I originally started via chat to inquire on my withdrawal request. Previously, Dave, was able to assist me via email. He did verify some basic info with me first. Jackie explained via chat that she could not assist me and I would need to call in. I explained I was helped before and she called me to verify me. She didn't sound enthused but I know another Jackie who is just as flat toned LOL."
P JONES,Did everything I needed efficiently.
MILLER VAN STONE,Horrible place my job rolled my stuff  to them with me knowing just for me to have to pay 35 for the account that I didn't want then other 25 the close the account then I had to wait from May 14 to get my check and I didn't get it till June 11
MARIA MORA,"I didn't choose you but somehow ended up with you which turned out to be a regrettable experience. First of all you want to charge me a whopping $60 in fees for a $192 transaction, that's over 30%, didn't know you're in the loan shark business!! It has taken me the better part of a month to finally receive that $60 back from you. This included at least 6-8 conversations with your so-called customer service reps who sometimes were helpful but more often told me what I wanted to hear in hopes of getting rid of me ( otherwise known as lying) yeah it was only $60 but as someone smarter than me once said it's the principal of the situation. Well good bye farewell hopefully our paths don't cross in the future as I certainly won't easily forget my experiences with you."
Kevin Flanagan,"Manager (Frank) was helpful, knowledgeable and great in customer service. We got connected in few issues like no options were given to keep the account remain open or other type of account offers. More aggressively in sales to coach associate going forward. Frank assure me that we in the process for our upgraded system, that will be much more beneficial for us as a customer. Correction on fees every year or annual charge will apply to your account. Great and Excellent customer service phone call by Frank (I’ll hire him for my company!) Thank you."
Joleen Roland,You should have never had my money.  You and Newport basically tock 35 for nothing.
KEITH LAZAGA,Please just take me to my account
KELLY MCCALL,Customer service was excellent. The young lady was very patient and knew exactly what I needed without very much explanation.
DAVID ALDAMA,The process was very easy to make my withdrawal
ANN BEATY,I didn’t like the fact that my account was transferred from an old employer and they immediately started charging me fees even though I had moved out of state and they didn’t have no where to send my information nor did I receive anything. My account was with them for a couple years not exactly sure when it was transferred but bout time they found me I had incurred so many fees it was ridiculous. Then they charged me to withdraw my money after they tacked on all the fees. Like it does not cost that much to house money. If I had a choice I wouldn’t go back with them nor recommend anyone else.
ROGER STEADMAN,I had some initial frustrations because I was not aware that my 401k had been rolled over to Millenium Trust.  I ended up speaking to several representatives over the phone in order to locate my funds and then roll them into my current employer's 401k.  Millenium was committed to making sure that my needs were taken care of fully.
Alexa,"My IRA was rolled over to Millennium after I was let go from a job.  The account was $1,899 at the time of the transfer.  By the time I withdrew my funds 2 years later, the account was only $1,650.  There were $35 fees every year...and the fund itself didn't grow at all.  If I would've had that money in my own pocket I could've easily made money on something like Robinhood (my personal brokerage account is up $10,000 this year).  The fees and the lack of effective investing are embarrassing.  How do you have $1,800 for two years and end up losing money?  Then charging me a fee because you don't know how to invest?  It's ridiculous.  The only reason I didn't give 1 star is because at least they made it easy (so far, at least) to request to withdraw my funds and close the account."
Susan Wright Lamb,I called to update my information. The representative was extremely friendly and very helpful. She took care of all of my needs. Thanks for a great experience!
Grace Meela Ruta,Excellent and professional customer service
Michael Manzo,so far we had a very positive experience.
Robert,"Extremely helpful. Walked me through the entire process. And then when I messed up later, helped me fix my mistake without any signs of frustration"
STANLEY ADAMS JR.,My wife helped me during recent hospitalization and customer service was exceptional
JEAN DIMARCO,"Awful website. Lack of information, user interface"
NATHAN PITSENBARGER,The gentleman who assisted me (I'm so sorry I can't remember his name) was super helpful and patient. He guided me through the website and informed me that the reason I could not log on before I called was because I needed to be on Chrome. I also wanted to go paperless and he sent an email to the department for me. Loved the customer service I received.
VICTOR CASTILLO,Service was amazing and very easy. I withdrew my 401k from here since I have a new 401k company under my job and they made it very simple for me to take the money out. Thank you so much for the wonderful service.
LINDA NEWMAN,The representative I spoke with very quick and efficient and able to provide me the information I called for.
STEPHANIE ,I really enjoyed your easy info!! Made my process so good!! Thank you so much!!
TIMOTHY SAWYER,"worst company ever!. took me 2 week,everyday dealing with you guys to get my money."
DAVID GRAHAM,I can't even see what money I have here without agreeing to astronomical fees.
JAGDISHKUMAR,"My experience was easy, quick, and painless!"
Maura ,The lady who helped me was thoroughly knowledgeable and pointed me right where I needed to go on the new website.
LISA McCartney Lauer,The folks at Millenium Trust are very helpful and friendly.
ShaLace Payne,"I find the Millenium Trust website to be difficult to navigate. It took me a while to find the information that I was looking for on the website. I think given the fact that they are just a custodian and not an actual brokerage they should tailor their experience more to the user who wants to transfer their account elsewhere. I really don't have a need to see any graphs or market share, etc if my money is not actively being invested. However, I do need to know or at least be notified when I'm being charged a $40 annual fee for my money to just be sitting in this account. There should additionally be way more information on the website about making a transfer out of Millennium Trust. For instance, you should let customers know up top and not at the bottom in small lettering that you are non-ACAT transfer, you don't have a broker clearing number, etc. The only thing Millennium Trust has going for themselves is their live chat and customer service."
Vicki Diamond,The customer service agent I spoke with was very helpful with the task I needed help with.
Happy Traveler,"The app was easy to navigate and easy to understand. The website isn’t over saturated with financial jargon, and the customer service reps were very helpful."
Billy Rolen,"Nice,I needed repeats because I couldn't hear"
Pat,"Communication was excellent, and the website was so easy to use!"
Katado,When speaking with them they were very helpful very informative of my situation and were able to Complete my request.
RICHARD BERRIO,They were very helpful and informative over the phone in providing me the information that I needed. Thank you!
H. SMITH,"It had been a couple years since I attempted to login to my account. I misplaced my answers to my security questions, and was worried I would not be able to access my account to roll over my money into a new employer's IRA account. I called the support line and was pleasantly surprised to hear that my security questions could be cleared and reset. I was given a temporary password to login and establish new answers to the security questions, which I will be sure to keep in a safe place this time, so I don't lose the answers again."
Justin moore ,Exorbitant fees. Difficult website.
ANTQUAREN MARSHALL,The process of closing out my 401k was easy and took no time at all. Thanks
Nick Alvarez,Easy to navigate website and real easy to use account.
STACY SEPULVEDA,"When I called Millennium, I was afraid that I wouldn't have all the information that I needed, but I was blessed with a lady named “Tosha” that helped me through the process. She was so kind and professional. Thank you Tosha for being who you are, and fir your knowledge of the job that you do."
MONICA HEMMEN-DUCKWORTH,"You acquired this asset from Transamerica, I started the process to move this back in November to my broker, Transamerica must have stalled moving it so you pay for the account .  Once acquired I had to do the SAME paperwork AGAIN and now it is June, 7 months later and I still do not have the account moved.  I realize you non-acat firm and are not held to the same quick turn around and it’s cash you are not moving as fast but it is still my asset and 7 months is ridiculous.   I am happy to report this as unwillingness to move it over?  Thanks goodness it is not a substantial amount"
Israel,I had excellent customer service the person that helped me guide me to what I needed and was very patient with me.
Frank,Has a login issue and it was free resolved quickly
STEPHANIE MCDOWELL,"Customer service was very professional, nice and helpful."
DIA RAMAHI,GhhjjhhhjCffgg
Susan Neumann ,You provide a great service..and your customer service is amazing.
BARBARA ,The representative that help me was compassionate and very professional. Thank you so much.
Mark Baker,"Unfortunately, I did not have the greatest customer service because since I was new at understanding how to complete the online registration to process my cash out, the Client Service Specialist, who assisted me via phone, could not clarify what I was asking and made it seem confusing. They also sounded impatient which didn’t help me complete the process smoothly. I would appreciate more respect please!!!"
AMY ASBURY-BOCAGE,My experience with Millennium Trust has been very satisfactory.
DAVID LABARBERA,I love that you can always speak to a real person if need be. They provide great customer service.
KORDEREK MOORE,"I needed to close out my account and the response was immediate and quick. I thought my online request  was going to take weeks, but I received my direct deposit in just two days. Thank you for being fast and efficient."
MATTHEW DAMIANO,"Janet, Customer Service Rep, went above and beyond to help me with access to my account online. Millennium Trust should be proud to have her in their employ."
Stephen Smith,Fast and efficient! Will definitely reccommend doing business!
Aaron Renteria,"It was difficult to log in.  The options to login were confusing and seem only catered to businesses. I am an individual and this was not an option.  I had to call, then they told me I had to use the internet.  so they sent me a link so I could find the right login location.  I finally got logged in.  When I asked to withdrawal my IRA, I was redirected to another site, but it was unable to load my data and would not let me continue.  After several tries I gave up and tried another day and it worked this time.A year prior I was trying to rollover the money and I followed the Millennium instructions and submitted the needed forms to where I wanted it rolled over to.  After weeks, my new firm told me that Millennium needed to initiate the transfer and that I could not ask them to initiate it on their behalf.  All in all I annoying and inconvenient and confusing experience.  I would never recommend them.  Oh all this and I had to pay fees to close my account!"
JOHN WHEELER,No communication when I sent my documents any times to withdrawal. Now direct line to question why they haven’t processed my request.
MASON BROWN,"I was looking for rolling over 401K from my previous employer with Millennium to Vanguard. The Millennium professional who spoke with me was very courteous, crisp and to the point. She knew what my needs were and responded via clear and simple email, while I was still thanking her on the phone.Absolutely superb"
KIMBERLY FINKLE,"Super easy distribution forms online. I had a small amount in an IRA that an employer had contributed and I didn't even know about. Millennium contacted me, confirmed identity, etc. I decided to simply cash out the balance. The online forms for distribution were very clear, very easy, and very quick. The balance went directly into my bank account literally in minutes. I never expected such a clear and easy process. Thank you."
HOLLIE EBERTH,"Every time I try to log in with my password and user ID I get locked out. The codes for resetting password are always invalid. We are talking about information I haver written down. Even when I try to log in right away, it shows invalid. I have two months trying to used this website."
Dave,"She was very kind,patient,great customer service"
"Magat, C","Rollover process laborious. No statements available online in June 2021 despite my account having been opened in March 2021. Customer service was very helpful and professional, no problems there. My qualms are with policy."

JASON M RUSSELL,The 1st representative was unable to answer our questions or provide us with the documentation needed to do a 401k roll over to our IRA account that we already have with Millennium Trust.  The 2nd representative's call was dropped.  The last representative that we spoke to was able to answer ALL our questions and provide us with the forms needed to complete our transaction.
Josefa Baylon,"It took me hours to set up my account.  Way too long. And 4 phone calls to your support team: 1:35pm Marilyn, Kavarah, Dan and Judy finished at 3:15pm. Even though your support team is helpful, the 16 questions each time I call is no picnic either.  Why not have voice recognition? or something quick and secure."
KIMBERLY MOORE,"The agent was helpful but wish I could get my statements sooner than 2/3 business days. And only once a year, common on."
Buddy Childress,"Although I have had only brief time with Millennium Trust, I realized the company is very professional, courteous, and prompt."
TATIANA ROJAS,Website was very helpful. Proper direction and instructions on how to roll over. Thank you for all your help.

Thank you, Millennium and thank you, Alicia!"

JENNIFER WILLIAMS,"I am simply trying to withdraw an IRA of $1550.00  I am having to establish an account online and then wait for a welcome letter, to then go and try to withdraw.  It would have been so easy for someone to help me over the phone.  They could have also sent me a form for my signature.  I do not appreciate this process."

Sharon Britton,I contacted you about my money and you’ve made it so hard for me to get my money! It’s my money not your money why can’t you make it easier for me to get my balance of my money?
DENTON LEE MERRIMAN,"I had received a letter from Millenium Trust, back in 2017, after I had been away from Munroe Regional Medical Center (now, Advent Health Ocala) for some time.  When I discovered the letter, in the process of packing up my home to move, I contacted Millenium Trust, regarding the possibility of still having some money to which I would be entitled.  The response was within seconds, and they provided easy access to the forms I needed to complete.  I am already aware of how much is in my IRA, how much I have requested to be deducted for the IRS, and I have some idea of how soon I will be receiving my payout, as a result of this excellent website.Thank you so very much, to all those involved with the resolution of my IRA!"
Jonathan Cecil,I liked the ease of rolling over a 401K to another employer's plan on line.

ANN G,"I had much difficulty trying to access my account online and fill out the withdrawal form.  I needed to call 3 times and bless the gal that helped me.  She was able to assist me and step by step she walked me through it and stayed on the phone with me a half hour to make sure I completed the form.  I was so frustrated I broke down crying and she calmed me with her very soft voice and caring manner.  I do not remember her name, I am sure you can look it up.  This woman was so kind and so supportive I was finally able to get through what had turned into nightmare that day.  She deserves recognition and a raise.  She is an asset to your company."
Richard May,Good job thanks
Az,"Phone system dropped me three times. I know it wasn't on my end as the connection was crystal clear as I went through the IVR (which was itself inefficient) and then dropped after I was connected to an associate. Despite verifying 7 different pieces of information to prove my identity, I have to wait 1-2 business days for IT to call me back so I can get into my locked out account. Never had this issue with any other reputable financial institution...most can rectify this in 15 minutes. And instead of asking me to submit a survey to them about my experience (i.e. so they can resolve the issue), they want me to post a public review? Seems Millennium is very confident in their customer service. They shouldn't be. As soon as I can get into my account, I'm taking my business elsewhere. Good customer service isn't that expensive."
FRANK CASTRO,The service was great!!! I appreciate the service okay.
ALEX MACAIONE,they never helped me get what I needed done. I'm just trying to get my money out of this company and the experience has been terrible

Justin,"After months of fighting with my original retirement plan company, and very poor communication on their part, my case was sent to Millennium Trust. And we accomplished more together in 15 minutes than I was able to in months with the other company! The tech was so nice and caring, I know I must have been a flustered mess! But she kept great patience with me and helped me get what I needed so fast!"
Rachel,Very efficient and courteous customer friendly staff
Pilar ,"The process  of closing my account was very easy and I received my funds right away. With all of the fees associated, I do not agree. 19% of my funds were taken as fees. The annual fee should have been prorated for the very few days I had the account. Not even a month let alone a year. Shouldn't have paid an annual fee for an account that I didn't want in the first place. Other than that, the process was very simple and fast. Very impressive."
VIKTOR WERNER,"Creating my account on the portal was easy and the website clearly showed my options. I was a little confused about how the funds were allocated once I made my withdrawal, it was not explained on the portal site. But, I called and spoke to a representative who explained and cleared it up easily for me."

MANUIA TUPUOLA,Consultant was attentive and understood why I was calling to resolve my issue.
MICHAEL OLZEN,Was very un happy with having to pay an annual fee for an account that has been with you for less than a week. Paying for paperstatements even though I never received a statement since the account was less than a week old. Yall owe me 45 dollars
Faasoo Sappa,The verification process just to access my account has taken too long. Also the $40 annual fee to hold my funds is also a deal breaker for me.  I will be moving my funds elsewhere.
CAYLIN WATSON,I was forced into using this company for my 401k roll over.  It was a nightmare! The website is garbage . If you can avoid them please do so.
GEORGE YASHENKO,The lady I talked to was very helpful and patient with me as I work my way through the online website.
ACHUSI/OKWI AFAM,"The man I was talking to was very helpful and knowledgable. I appreciate his help. Although, I do NOT like that I am charged to have an account and close an account... when I didn't choose to send my earned money to this company in the first place. Oh well."
CHRISTIN M,Very quick and excellent service!
Karine Tarkhanian,I really Appreciate the kindness and customer service I received in helping me through a rollover withdrawal.
Ted,Ok. I filled out paperwork...didn't check that I'm under 59.5 years old and amount of distribution. Ok. Born in 74' so younger than 59.5 and u have amount! So I get email saying u received my request. Didn't get a hold of me how I missed these two things...nothing. only way I found out was for me calling. Terrible communication!!!! But the woman I called was helpful so that's the only reason u get the 3 stars!
Diego Ordaz Barron,Representative was very helpful and polite
Jean Lemaire,Very helpful and excellent customer service. They made sure all my needs where taken care of. Especially since I forgot about this account. I had work for this company in years. But they took care of all my needs.
Lamecia Merchant,From start to finish this was a great company
WILLIAM STYERS,They helped  me out a lot! Very professional employees. All my questions were answered.
MARK SINNWELL,You company was a big help to and you teach out to mr knowing I had the 401K money

JULIE SNODGRASS,Excellent Service. Strongly Recommended.
DIANA,I had a great time with you all today on the phone the lady I spoke to was nice and treated me right she had all the time in the world and I appreciate everything she done for me thanks

Give her a raise and the employee of the century award! I mean it. Feel free to reach out if I can expand in anyway.
Chanelle Sykes,Was quick and easy...to cash out IRA...just waiting for deposit...just wish would give you a time frame but other than that quick and easy...

I had to call back again , because I got locked out of my account, I received the same courteous, respectful , and knowledgeable help as I did the first call, but from a different Representative!!!!                                 Thank You                              Philip D’Arezzo"
RONISE DORCE,Walked me through the whole process. Great customer service.
Debbie Aleman,"Horrible. They make it unbelievably difficult for you to assess or transfer your OWN money. There are no options to take care of your own money online or via phone. They give you countless hoops to jump through and find any way to make the process more difficult. Not to mention the outrageous fees. What a scam of a ""company""."
VIRGINIA BARNES,I was helped in a quick and informative manner.
MICHAEL ISAACSON,The lady was very helpful and I appreciated it very much especially during this stressful time
DONALD CULPEPPER,I had a wonderful experience today and in the past. Outstanding customer service with support and empathy for my personal situation.
FEDERICO DE JESUS,"The company held my cash, and instead of adding interest like most financial institutions do when you keep money with them..you wiped out my funds with ridiculously unjustified fees. I appreciate the rep who did what he could, but his abilities were far to limited my the organization. I am more likely to spend time on social media warning others about this organization as I would recommending others."
RAQUEL LEYVA DE TAPIA,"I've closed an IRA before, and all I had to do was call the company. With Millennium, I called the company, and the CSR told me to register online and close the account myself. The first time I tried to register, the system was down. Days later, I was finally able to register. After the registration, it's still not clear to me how to close the account and just cash out what little money I have. I already earned that money; why do I now have to work hard to take it out? What am I being charged the processing fee for if I have to close it out myself online."
ROBERT SAINT,The representative that I spoke with regarding one of my accounts was very courteous and knowledgeable. The information that she told me was easy to understand. I was able to access my info on my online account. I recommend this to everyone.

Mary E,Good clear answers to my issue today. Thanks
KIMBERLY ELVEUS,"Very helpful with easy to understand documents, and instructions. I find this company VERY trustworthy."
DEREK EDWARDS,"Literally no response from MT.  If I can get my money out, I will.  This is ridiculous that you manage money and can’t reply to question RE performance reporting."
TRUDY MCCOLLAM,"Worst experience. Took more than 3 weeks to create an account. Worst customer support and UI experience. Unless I call customer support, there is no feedback on the onboarding. Had to restart process 3 times to get onboarded."
WANDA I,"I received my card with my money on it, although it was somewhat involved to get everything activated to where I could use it. All is good though. Thanks."
KATIE GAFFNEY,The experience to set my account up was simple. I was quite pleased!
CHANTEL BASTIN,Great help overall and answered my questions with all the correct information
MARIBEL MCGONAGLE,"I called and got someone in a foreign country I believe who could not find my account and could not help me. She was going to have someone call me back that day but I never got a call. Called the next day and got someone working from home and they could not help me and said someone would call me back that afternoon, No call. I waiting a few days and called back again and the person could not help me and said they would have someone call me back. They finally did after I mentioned this was third time and I finally got my account straightened out."
ANA SCOTT,"I called inquiring about a distribution. The gentlemen I talked to was very helpful, until he told me that he was going to look in to when exactly I would get my money. He put me on hold and told me it would be just a minute, I sat on hold for 20 minutes and he never came back on the phone."
MICHELLE BEJARANO,"Your customer service is awesome and very helpful. I would recommend Millennium Trust to all my friends. Thanks, Stanley Spitler"
REGINA COOPER,"I had to deal with Millennium Trust Co. due to the need for an IRA rollover. I got very good instructions in the mail, but had an issue logging in. When I called there was less than 3 minutes of wait time, and Peggy assisted me with my issue. Then she went above and beyond to call me back after I had hung up while on hold. She wanted to make sure that I was taken care of, and had not been cut-off. Although I don’t have extensive experience with Millennium my first impression was a good one, and Peggy is a very efficient and friendly customer service associate. She is an asset to Millennium and my dealings with her have me considering keeping an account with Millennium."
Jose Lucas,"Due to unfortunate occurrence, I lost my job six weeks ago. And have been waiting for unemployment. Trying to reach the Pennsylvania unemployment office was extremely difficult and getting a response was even more so. In desperation I reached out to millennium trust to liquidate my 401(k) from a previous employer. After a short delay over memorial day weekend, I spoke to a woman named Catania (sp?) who listened to my story and said she would expedite. Minutes after I pushed the button to submit my request to have my funds direct deposited into my checking account, the funds were there! I cannot thank her enough for her kindness, compassion and superb customer service!"
Rex Perry,The person I worked with did great. She stayed with me through the entire process.

Vanessa,Teriyaki blah blah blah blah blah
SREY,"These guys have been great.I did not even choose them, but my IRA was sent into their care when my previous employer closed the business.Their fees were pretty reasonable and working with them has been very easy.I appreciate all the help these guys gave me.Keep up the great work!"
CHELSIE ANDING,"Being blamed for someone hacking into your system is inappropriate and so not professional.  I didn't pick you guys to handle my money, it was HSBC who must have contacted the least expensive group to transfer my funds to. OBVIOUSLY. And the fact that other small accounts like mine were also affected means that YOU were hacked and not that my password was taken from another site.  As of right now, none of my other accounts have been compromised."
Theo Mcsween,Withdrew from my account. Process was easy and fast. Appreciate the great service!
PATRICK S.,It is a great customer service the agent knows what they doing. My questions was answered and probably was solved. Thank you

Maricia Astafan,Very quick service. Follow up was great. Trustworthy company.
DW,Very good company will recommend them to anyone
CHARLES,The gentleman that helped me answered all the questions I had and was very helpful

Esie,The representative I spoke with was pleasant and informative.  He answered all my questions.
Guleid Adam,Millennium Trust was exactly where I needed my funds to go until I was ready to move them .They were helpful and easy to contact .They also offer many other investment tools and programs that I plan to utilize in the near future. I had no concerns of my information going outside of the safe parameters they provide. I would recommend them no doubt. Thank you millennium trust!
Malethea Brown,"I had never accessed my account online previously and was unable to figure out how to do so.  I did not have my account number and was not even sure what ""type"" of account I have, but after verifying my identity, the associate was able to provide all of that info to me and instruct me how to access my account.  She was very helpful ... and friendly about it."
ERIN S,"At my age, did not have a clear understanding of what exactly to do regarding the information received via mail. The young woman I spoke with was not only extremely knowledgeable about her company and products, she was kind, sincere, very courteous, and patient. She made sure I understood everything. Great Job!"
DEBORAH SPIELMAN,Spoke with Alicia from Millennium Trust and she have been super helpful and patient! Very much grateful to her!
JOYCE CHAFFIN,"Kamarsha and JoAnn really worked hard to help me solve my little problems.  These folks were not just “going through the motions “, but tirelessly worked at helping explore the various options to problem solve.  Excellent people!"
MALACHY HIGGINS,"I requested to withdraw my funds and have them deposited into my account. The system advised it would be done within 1-2 business days. It has now been over one week and I have yet to receive anything in my account. The website shows that I no longer have the funds, but there is no record of the withdrawal. This is very confusing and scary."
KRISTY,Extremely disappointing first experience with Millennium Trust where I mail a check to deposit in to my IRA and am told it’s 1 day late(postmarked) to apply to the 2020 tax year.
SCOTT BIRNEY,"I spoke to Jackie,  who was very knowledgeable, and answered all of my questions."
LEAH ,"This was a rollover from a 401K from a previous employer. During the time that the funds were with MTrust, they were easy to track. We wanted something with a higher yield that was more accessible as we go into retirement."
Michael Paulsen,Easy to use website. Easy transactions!
WILLIAM JONES,"I wasn’t given a choice of what company my money went to.  It sure wouldn’t have been this one.  I have a free account with fidelity that serves me perfect.  To charge an annual fee, monthly charges and a fee to close my account seems really out of touch.  REALLY OUT IF TOUCH.  You are thieves and crooks."
RAFAEL AMARO,I was not aware I had money in my former companies 401(K).  I was able to roll it over with no problems.
ALYSSA,Great customer service; friendly and very informative.  Representative made experience pleasant. Overall it was a good experience.
LACEY Barnard,The lady on the phone was very helpful. She explained everything I needed to do to close my account with step by step instructions. Thank you!
JEFFREY GUNTHER,"Nickel and dimed thanks to useless fees. This company’s job is to help me earn more money, and penalized me for leaving by adding bs fees. None of these fees are for value added services and are arbitrary."
JOSHUA MAGAN,"money transfer has not come through yet after a full week, typically I've received funds in a matter of days.  this delay has caused significant personal hardship"
LUZ DELGADO,Was a little round the bush to get to things but overall it worked.
JOHNNY FELICIANO,They suck. My money’s been with them for two years and has just lost money. No capital gains after two years?

MICHAEL BACH,Helpful and received my paperwork promptly as told I would.
JANET NIER,Millennium Trust website was very easy to use. I was able to easily find all the information I needed to make an informed decision about my account.
GILLIAN PIGGOTT,I have had no problem with Millennium and am enjoying having someone help me save for emergencies.
ERIN MALONEY,The extra charges were exorbitant to continue to use your services!! Why would anyone keep an account with your company?
J. BROWN,Millennium Trust took care of my holdings during my contract years with my current employer... this rollover is going to be sweet.  Thanks MT
ROSS SHRAGO,"Worst experience ever.  I did not choose this company, an old company I worked for dumped my IRA and Roth IRA here.  When it came time to get my money to a money manager that I trust and that was actually going to do something with it, it took more than 2 months to release my money.  No other reputable company takes more than 2-5 days to transfer the funds in my experience.  But this company it was always an excuse....  we didnt jump through this hoop or we didnt jump through that hoop, delaying the transfer another 10-14 days every time they had “found” an issue."
JOSEPH C,"I requested a distribution over a week ago and had not received any sort of update until I emailed asking for an update, and even then it was a form letter response. I'm glad I'm taking all of my money out. The worst service I have ever had."
Nicole,Website was very helpful and it helped me with what I was trying to do on the website.
GERARDINA ARASIN,"This website took a while the help me out and answer my question, it's understandable due to the high demand they are under. So be patient and understanding and you'll find a great result with them..."
PAUL HARTZELL JR,"We are on our third attempt to submit an IRA Distribution Request because Millennium keeps rejecting the request. With both rejections, the representative we talked to requested paperwork or additional information that DIRECTLY CONTRADICTED the instructions on the form. In fact, the second representative contradicted the first representative and agreed with us about whether a letter from our bank was required. But, he went on to request additional information about account liquidation that the first representative did not require! This, despite the form clearly stating that the information is not necessary. If we could change custodians, we absolutely would."
JOSH ROBINSON,Fast and excellent service. Thanks.
JOHNTAE KILLINGS,"I called to request a paper copy of my statement for my account after it transitioned from the previous carrier and was told that one would be emailed to me-- it would be so much simpler to just have this available on the website rather than having to call, but I called and was told it would be emailed--it's the end of the business day and still no copy of my account in email but the survey of how Millinium handled it arrived.   Since what I needed was not taken care of, the review is not good.  Just give the option online and it would save me a lot of time."
B Smi,Phone call was brief but efficient. Received all the correct info I needed with no follow up. Great experience 👍
SHAUN ARRIAGA,"I have been dealing with Millennium for a couple years now, trying to get a distribution from my sister's account, as she had passed away over 2 years ago.   Each of her beneficiaries on her account have been very frustrated going through the very long process of signing up to get their distributions.   Now we have watched the investment millennium was holding for my sister, lose over a third of its value, and have the investment's board of directors halt any distributions as it is going through a class action lawsuit.  So none of the beneficiaries have received a penny.    It looks like the investment my sister had through Millennium was not a good one.  I have wondered who advised her on this terrible investment."
JOSHUA ROTH,The customer service was professional; I received a quick response and total support from their team. I transferred my money in a couple of minutes from my account with Millenium Trust to another personal account.

I am so upset that my former employer rolled over my funds to MT without even notifying me first!!!! This company's customer service is so bad it's criminal. I almost considered just leaving my money here, because it was so difficult to get a distribution... and that's exactly what they want!! I won't let them win!!"
Albert Lee,"Your site is terrible.  It keeps redirecting me and asking me to put the same information I’ve already entered.  It then directs me to another area that I don’t need, and when I go back it wants me to reenter my info again!  It almost seems like this is on purpose just so y’all can keep peoples money, if ya can’t get to it then y’all can keep charging those exorbitant fees!"
ERICA JACKSON,"Knowledgeable, easy to work with."
ANGEL GONZALEZ,Ward's instructions were very clear.  This made it easy for me to request the distrubution when I was ready to do so.  Thank you.

SARAH CONANT,I think this website definitely has their stuff together and it was very easy to navigate and I was able to fill out a withdrawal form very easily and they explain every question with detail so I was able to understand everything.
Matrika Siwakoti,"It’s really a inconvenience that I couldn’t get my check sent to me without having a form directly mailed to me to fill out & send back or registering on their website. Instead it would be much easier to request the check and them process it for you, but instead I had to talk to multiple reps (all were nice) but I kept having issues online registering bc my birthday was out in wrong when my account was received. I think 1 phone call, if I can fully verify my account..I think the rep should be able to process my check and send it out to me! It would be a lot more enjoyable for a customer. But all the reps I spoke today we’re wonderful and helpful and I was able to get it after about an hour."
Noel Apostol,I tried several times to get into my account on the webpage.  It kept invalidating my security answers and made me change my password.  It then locked out my account.I had to call into Customer Service to get into the account.  I was then informed that I would have to get a password encrypted email to access my statement in a few days.Incredible.  Just for a statement!  Took over an hour and now I have to wait days for more hoops to jump thru.
CANDICE BRANSTUTTER,Answered all of our questions quickly and efficiently.
Melissa,"I called millennium trust regarding the account summary I received in the mail. I had no idea what company had set up this account for me so I was confused about the money and where it came from. The representative refused to tell me what company this account was set up through and insisted that I set up an account through the online portal where I would be able to find this information once I confirmed my account. Although a hassle, I created an account On the website where I was still unable to find the information I needed. Guess I will be making another phone call. Ugh."

ERNESTINE ROBINSON,"All of the Millennium employees who were part of the process in getting my 401K investment to Merrill Lynch were extremely knowledgeable, supportive, eager to assist, and easy to work with.  The issue of how to transfer the funds took only two phone calls with customer service; the first set of instructions on how to navigate Millennium's data base in order to do so was not sufficient enough to complete the process.  The second call did the trick by following the ""work-around"" instructions offered.  Thank you Millennium!"
SETH LAIDLEY,"They get it. We got it, others got it. We get it now have so pay the pied piper"
JERRY DOUGLAS,They froze my account without notifying me and delayed a trade that needed up costing me. Very disappointed
BRAULIO SAN MARTIN,"The customer service rep was very nice, super polite, and patient. However, my issue was not resolved and while I was on hold for a manager, my call was disconnected and I did not receive a call back from the manager even though the CSR took down my number specifically in case we got disconnected. Initially gave MTC a 1-star review.Received a call back from the manager--it took a few days--but once I spoke to the manager, my issue was completely resolved in a matter of minutes. I was super thankful and very grateful for the assistance, they took my 1-star review and completely flipped it to a 5-star review. Great job, MTC!"
MINYARISHA BELTON,good service

The process appears to be fragmented, cumbersome, and instructions were not complete when I made the initial call."
VALLAIRE WILSON,I called twice. First time was on the phone for 5 min then she hung up on me. Then second lady was rude as hell with no sense of humor.
Krystal,"Your customer service person was very helpful and professional, as she helped me through the process. Keep up the great work. Thanks again."
ROBIN WEBER,In a time of unexpected expenses thank you.Kory was slot of help reassure me it was ok to ask for a distribution of funds.
MARIE VIXAMAR,"Ethically questionable, actually I am surprised some of these practices are even legal. I signed up for a retirement account (through my previous employer) with another company. When I left my job, the company apparently transferred my retirement account to Millennium trust without my consent.  Again, without my consent they moved my investment from a growth fund to something making less than 1%. When I finally figured this out and tried to move the money someplace else, I've been getting what feels like a run-around. A month ago I called to move it and they said they needed a month to get the account established. After calling 3 times today (one time getting directed back to Mass Mutual which was an error), I finally got the ball rolling. I was not able to even get started without checking a box saying I agree to multiple fees which I actually do not agree to. They say it can take 72 hours to set up your 'account' in order to transfer it, even though they've had my money for months. I would not ever do business again with Millennium and hope regulators will do something so that people have to give permission to opt-in to this network."
DANITA CUNNINGHAM,I called customer service because I could not remember which portal was the correct one for me AND I  had forgotten my username. It had been awhile since I had logged on. The rep was very pleasant. After answering a few security questions she help me with everything I  needed and could give me an update on the status of a rollover transaction I requested last month. All and all my experience with Millennium Trust has been positive.
H.J.,Awesome. I was able to contact them online and process was quick. Thank you
Roy Austin,Judy was a wonderful help. She walked through with everything with me till it was successful thank you so much...
Corey Jennings,They were very understanding and knew how to clearly explain our doubts
BENJAMIN HYDE,"Rep misinformed which did not allow me to complete electronic distribution transactions. I was informed I would have to complete doc document, which caused me to go to my bank to gather extra documents. I inconvenienced all because rep provided me incorrect information."

Lisa G,My review is positive. My representative was extremely helpful. Thank you.
KEVIN TROMBLEY,"Ethically questionable company. They buy your account off a former employer, don’t notify you of the changes, and a year later when you track them down, raise multiple barriers to slow down or prevent you getting your money out from them. Unfortunately, if they got your money they probably weren’t required to get your consent and you’re now stuck with them. If you’re a company and reading reviews, please treat your employees better and don’t give do business with Millennium."
SHAUN PIRRONE,Easy and fast services
Zachery West,The customer service reps I spoke with were amazing and I am very thankful to them
JACOB PATTERSON,I had a question about my account and Tim was very helpful in getting my account in order.
STEVEN LERCH,"The online process was very easy.  The only negative thing to say is that when I called in to speak with someone, the rep wasn't very nice.  I was trying to tell her something and she kept talking over me, saying ""let me finish""  At the end of the day, I am the customer and that sort of stuff won't fly."
LARISSA SHERMAN,Thank you for your patience and professionalism.
LAURA JENKINS,The representative was extremely rude right from the very start of the conversation. Her attitude gave me an extremely poor first impression of your company. It’s hard to believe this is a reputable company Especially considering my funds were transferred to you without my consent. The representative may think that breathing deeply and barely containing her anger at me for seeking clarification is acceptable but it is not.  Unbelievable. I understand that everyone is going through a difficult time but that is no way to behave in a business.
TAMARA THOMPSON,The CSR was really helpful and explaining everything clearly.
ELVIA PIZARRO,It’s way too difficult to transfer funds or shares into a personal IRA at another company. Fees are too high.
GREGORY LESTER,I can't access the statement even though I was given a code.
Greg Kiernan,I just need this money cause my financial cituation and I don't have a job so I have to close this account cause I need to use this money
Ibrahima Bangoura,"I was employed at a corporation for 3 months and then the office was closed. Since my 401K was less than $5000 it was put into a Millennium account and I received the notice of this in the mail. I had to call Millennium and go through quite a lot of steps just to even view my account online. I understand that security is an issue, creating my access was more difficult than necessary. That said, once I was in the system, navigating the website getting a distribution was quite straightforward. Also the phone support lady was very nice and helpful. Overall very good experience, but please update the homepage of the website to explain the steps of creating an account (user access)."
DENNIS WOLFE,I had a most professional encounter with your personnel yesterday. I'm nothing but pleased with expert guidance I received.
MARTHA TORRES,Trying to transfer money out (rollover) from Millennium Trust to another account is a nightmare!
Stephen  Carter,The website was user friendly and was able to do my transaction easily!
J LAMB,very helpful and professional customer service
CLAY MAKEE,"Too much red tape to get your account number. They are slow in processing things. The service fees are high. I still have not received access to my account.  (2) Comment. Yes, I have full access, but I want to transfer to another company and this too is taking too long.  Also, I don not like that I have to pay to get my own money. This is crazy."
Casey Ryan,Customer service was very friendly and knowledgeable.
MARIA MEDEL,"I seldom visit this website, and for good reason.  Virtually everytime I attempt to login I get an error message and am required to contact customer service.  Which takes you through numerous prompts to reach someone to help.  Once I accomplished that I was told that the problem could not be rectified immediately and I would be emailed a solution later that day.  Two days later the email arrived and guess what?  Error message again, and the process began all over.  If I could take my money to a different place I would, but my advisor recommends against it."
MIGUEL C.,Getting all my investments in one place this went well.
Lynn Dashner,Process of signing up and seeing my funds was easy. Plenty charts and graphs.website was easy to navigate which is most important to me.
NICOLE SHORTT,It's taking forever to get the welcome email I need to get into my profile

SHARMAN GILLINGHAM,The representative was very polite and informative.She was able to answer my questions and guide me through the process of transferring my Account.
TIMOTHY HILL,"The customer service is at best subpar. I started my account transfer process in January and they kept giving me the run around in what was needed. I had to just pull my money out of the IRA in May for the lack of adequate help. Everyone i spoke to there was happy to help me until they found out I wanted to move my account. If you have a choice, don't pick this company."
CAROLYN DUCHENE,Very poor response to requestb to unlock my account. It has been locked for over 4 days and I'm still locked out.Mike was very difficult to deal with and required constant requests for his help and was very adverserial.
ROMELIA J. ,"Quick and easy use of site, communication was excellent. Recommend them highly,  thank you."
HECTOR MANJARREZ,Great Job. Thank you.
DYLAN UNSWORTH,Everything through this company seems more difficult than necessary.

Britney Douglas,"This service is horrible. People have told me incorrect information, waiting time is so long, online portal is not informative and not user friendly, and I am still waiting for my welcome email way past the 1-3 days I was told. I have no idea what's wrong. I'm just trying to rollover my money and it's been about a 2 week process so far. This is ridiculous."
Bernardo Hernandez,"I don’t remember her name but she was so helpful!!  She stayed on the phone with me while I got the answers we needed, gave me helpful tips.  So nice!!"
AVIS CHAN TACK,"The customer service rep, Judy, was professional, friendly, and very helpful."
JH,Very helpful on setting up my accounts. Excellent and friendly service. Was a pleasure.
Aaron Moss,At first when activating my account the person was helpful and stepped me through it. I thought it would be great but soon realized why everyone gave negative reviews. I asked to transfer my account because trading on their for their website UI was to clunky and didn't give much information compared to other trading platforms. I requested a transfer that took 3 months. The platform I wanted to change to requested that they never received the check from Millennium. They sent it and apparently they delivered it. The two times I called I got two different dates saying they sent it. I waited patiently because they said it would take 2 weeks by mail. 1 month 1 week later I call back Millennium because those funds were not transferred or received by my new platform. Tired of their BS I stop the payment and request a wire transfer in which they charge me two separate $30 fees just for their crappy service. Terrible stay away from this company.
Erick,Very helpful! He helped me get my funds expedited without any issues. Thank you!
"massia, graydon, edison",I had a smooth easy transaction with setting things up..

Charles McDaniel,I had a small self directed IRA account through Fundrise that required using Millennium Trust. I decided after seven months I no longer wanted the funds in Fundrise. I filled out the forms for both companies to move the IRA to another site. This required four months and completed in Jan 2020. I now see a charge five months after the fact for the upcoming year from Millennium. I filled out all the forms to move all the money from all the companies back in 2020. I did everything absolutely 100% correct. Talking to both companies they point the finger to each other. I have no way to end this relationship... I can't close Millennium until Fundrise fully liquidates and when I ask Fundrise to fully liquidate they find another penny that was missed six months down the line after they said they liquidated.. Every form filled out means waiting months and months meanwhile the fees being charged exceed whats sitting left in the account..
KATHLEEN MOSELLE,Excellent customer service support system
Tanya Wilson,"The customer agent was very courteous, informative,  and humorous.  The automated system was easy to use"
CINDA FEAGAN,"I had a 401K rolled into an account with millennium. I tried to set up the account online and called them. I did as the rep instructed. But no response yet if my account has been finalized.I will call again, but so far just a poor rating from me."
GABRIELLA CALLAWAY,Long wait to get a person on the phone.  Takes several days to get a statement.    Turnaround time seems long to me.
Nathan Hocking,Website sucks. Customer service incredibly unhelpful in navigating it. Not user friendly AT ALL
Dominique Durogene,"This is one of the most unfriendly a horrible website that I have worked with, not easy to work with"

FRED CROCKETT,I had some questions regarding opening a new IRA account. The person I spoke to was responsive and knowledgeable.
Suzanne Christenson,I called customer support for further assistance and I was easily able to have my matter resolved at an expeditious rate!
LAWRENCE PITTS,It took many many days and calling more than once to activate my account to cash my funds. One of the times a woman’s customer service was very low quality. On the other hand the woman who last helped me was patient and very good. Just my honest review-1 star
Nicole C. ,I spoke with Erica. She answered promptly and was knowledgeable and very helpful answering my questions.
JOANN ALBER,"When the company I previously worked for sold, my 401k was transferred to Millennium Trust as an IRA. The timing was exceptionally terrible for me, and as someone not fortunate enough to have an accountant or tax adviser on call, this was not something I was comfortable managing. After numerous calls to my new employer's plan, and to millennium trust, and back again, I felt so trapped in the middle I gave up trying to move the funds to my new plan. Both told me the other company needed to initiate the transfer over and over. When I requested step by step instructions I received links to a video to watch. Will not recommend for anything other than a last resort."
ALLAN CHESTER,Everything went fine. The only reason I gave less than 5 stars is because my financial institution and I had to duplicate our work when the first rollover request would not process as the funds were not liquidated.  The act of requesting seems to have liquidated them which allowed us to process the second request successfully
KIANA PEARSON,Was easy to complete
Alan Hecker,professional and helpful. was able to help me with my inquires
RANDY LITTLE,"I was recently notified that an old employer's Retirement Account was rolled over to MTC. I decided to roll it over to my new employer's Retirement Account. However, it was not as easy as it could've been. Their ""Outgoing Transfer Instructions"" failed to mention going back into the Portal to request a direct rollover to your current employer’s plan, please click on ""Deposits & Transfers"" then ""Withdraw/Distribute"". That would've been quick and to the point. It took an extra email to customer support to figure this out. Also, MTC will NOT send a check to the new account, only to the account holder, who then has to send it on. (Extra, unnecessary steps, in my opinion)Lastly- the fees they charged are exorbitant, especially for the little amount my account had and the short amount of time they had it."
Elisha McKnight,Make it way to hard to roll over to another account. Have to jump through to many hoops.
DOMNEIK COX,They have good support and the people I talked to were polite and professional.

Montrell Hammond,"I called and a wonderful woman by the name of Nicole was extraordinarily helpful with every question I had.

She was simply wonderful and should be considered an absolute gem of an employee as her service was outstanding!Oriana Schatan"

TAVARRIS TATE,Not sure if I was able to request funds to be sent for me to do a rollover.... very confusing
John,I was not sent information regarding my 401k before and the Company didn't know either so on Saturday I received a letter on how to make changes or find out my information I was actually excited. I recently had a death in my family and had no idea what or how I was going to attempt to get extra funds needed and my prayers were answered! The kind lady I spoke with made it painless and I even recieved my funds sooner than expected.
COSMIN BURUGA,My  401K was moved here without my authorization. They charged me over $100 in fees in the 4 months my money was there.

PETER BACKLUND,Quick and attentive service - my experience with Millennium is always good - thank you!
DON GILBERT,"I have an IRA Transfer that has taken weeks to switch over. 39481DFET is the account number. No communication, no emails, no nothing."
MELVIN LEE,The person was great but I am not sure why I was charged a $25 account closure fee due to my former employer transferring my retirement account to the management of Millennium Trust.  That charged should have been directed to my former employer.

Gary King,I would just like to say thank you to Millennium Trust and all of their staff that I spoke with. They made closing out my account easy and seamless.

KEN HAMILTON,"Millennium is the most helpful, polite, straight forward financial institution I have worked with to date.  Thank you."
TAYLOR CHA,"The level of professional and the attention to detail when providing service to their customers needs to be improved. When dealing with representatives, I was left with more questions than answers. Representatives were not very knowledgeable about their policies or procedures."
Christine Hernandez,The representative was very helpful and knowledgeable and quickly addressed my questions with information that I could use.
LOUIS MARTINEZ,I request tax form for 2020

DUANE DRAKE,The online experience was excellent and I am pleased with the results at this time.
KIMBERLY ARIAS,"As a 21 year old with no knowledge on retirement plans, Millennium Trust made it easy for me to navigate my IRA options with their knowledgeable customer service representatives."

Carole Johnson,I am trying to transfer my money out of my account and the service I got was terrible.
RICHARD EBERHARD,I have no complaints I had a good transition and thank you for the service your company provided me.
Yovanny Williamson,It's so hard to communicate with this company. I spent the last year trying to transfer funds to a different bank and finally had to just close my account and take cash because nothing else worked.
MARK PERKINSON,She walked me through every step and made the process so much easier.
CYNTHIA MUNOZ-MILLONES,"We have been trying for several weeks now to set up an IRA and Fundrise account. The experience has been terrible. We both work regular hours, so we have to do this in the evening. When we run into a snag, the offices are closed and we cannot get any help. We have taken a few hours off work twice now, to try to resolve the issues. We have talked to several representatives. Every time we get to the last part of the questions on the site or with a representative , your site will not let us continue. On Friday we thought we were finally able to set up an account with Millennium only to find out that the site would not take our credit cards. (the credit cards are perfectly fine ) We were told that you would work on the problem. This is not working out for us. Your site is too convoluted and difficult to navigate. Our $10,000 that we wanted to invest with you will be going elsewhere. It should not be difficult to ask you to take our money!Thank you for asking about our experience. Steve"
JAMES LEE,"Worst service - having to provide drivers license, passport since the account was transferred by another company - it took 5 phone calls and paperwork galore for $2K of value - rediculious"
Kelly Harris,"-- original review --My old 401(k) for some reason had money in it 20 years after I left the job and had rolled it over to an IRA elsewhere. I got a random email about the old 401(k) provider automatically rolling over my account for me to this trust company. Millennium effectively stole $60 worth of fees (6% of my total assets) from this account just so I could transfer it to my IRA elsewhere -- ""account establishment fee"" + ""annual fee"" (which they charge immediately) + ""account closing fee."" What a racket! Not to mention they have no easy way to do an electronic transfer to a large broker so I did an indirect rollover. You probably don't have a choice if you're using this place because you're likely dealing with a rollover of funds you didn't even know you had, but I feel ripped off.-- updated 5/17/21 --Got a call from Kamila who was very friendly and helpful, and she returned the initial account fees for me, leaving only the transfer fee, which is not a big deal since all trustees and custodians charge fees when you transfer your money out. Still, for an account that was moved without my knowledge (I blame Paychex for this part), it is frustrating to have to jump through hoops rather than just not being charged those fees if, for example, the account is transferred within a short period (days) after opening."
Marda Williams,Terrible service.  The rep showed little to no interest in being helpful.  She could not wait to get off the call
JESSICA PENNINGTON,Thank for your kindness and patience.
NAYEF KHODR AGHA,Followed directions and got it done in just a few days.
Eva ,"My employer rollover my remaining 401k to Millenium Trust. Unfortunately, I’m currently pregnant and I need to withdraw it to use. The transaction went great, very smooth and the service from the employees are very excellent. I’m gonna choose Millenium Trust again to save and invest our money again. I trust this company, they treat you as their family. Kudos to all the employees who help me and I got to share my little story as well 😊."
HOLLY W,The staff was very patient and nonjudgmental. She took me step by step to complete my information without making me feel that the process should progress more rapidly.
customer,fantastic security all the way around. of was a little difocukt to navigate for that sake but any time i had an isuse or a question they were imediatley avaialable bybphone or email. i even accidentally contacted two seperate offices via email and they managed tonput both the concerns together and respond with one clear and concise response in less than 2 hours on a weekend. very impressed.

Anita Rodriguez,"The service coordinator was friendly, very efficient, and made the experience stress-free.  I was asking for assistance with the process of withdrawing funds from my IRA account. The information she provided was easy to follow. I would highly recommend Millennium Trust with confidence.Kenny K."
CARL HATCHER,"I called twice about transferring funds and the representatives I spoke to gave me incorrect information and explained that the only way to move my money to my new employer was to have them contact millennium, which you all know if not policy. All along their was a place online for me to move my money and all that was needed was for your representative to provide me with help instead of making me feel like I would not be able to ever get my money out. Though the change is due to an employer change, and I never wanted to have this account in the first place (my past employer decided to move it without you or them alerting me first), I will never be moving my money here and plan to insist any company I work for not do business here either. All I needed was simply to roll out from this custodian and roll into a new one and the process has taken over 4 months. I expected this company to be the experts but apparently that’s not good business."

GARY TITTINGER,"I am very angry. I didn’t ask my previous employer to send my messily 200$ to this company per my paper work from my previous employer I was waiting on a check.  I did not receive this check but the 2 week waiting period was not up for this check to come through the mail. I was given a 25$ account closing fee so now my amount is down to 175.  What crap. I guess my money is now there money.  I didn’t even want there company to be involved. If I would have known that this was going to happen, I would have asked my previous employer not to.  That 200$ is 2 weeks of groceries for my family of 6. They should have not charged me the 25$. I could understand if my amount was greater than 500$ to take the 25$ but come on.  It’s always hurt the little guy.  Keep the poor, poor."
Jessica  Carlton,Web site was very informative and easy to use
MARY KISTHART,"I give Carlos in Client Services a 5 but the Customer access a 3 as it took 2 calls, going through the automated messages and putting in information to get to a real person to update my credit card.  This would have been accomplished by the link in the email, asking for updated credit card billing information, but it didn't work.  Sometimes putting customers at arm's length is a real turn off.  Fortunately I am not a perspective customer but an existing customer."

A lot of questions that neither we could answer. Had to have person assisting us on the phone thru some questions. Definitely not an easy project, but ended with a closed account. Also, got the deposit much quicker than anticipated."
JB,"I wouldn't say they went out of their way to get me my money ""now"" (which are most of the complaints from the BBB. I gave three stars because average is where they sit.

Salvatore Induisi,Quick response and help people online application
JOHN MORGENSTERN,"Your site sucks.  I tried to register and it tells me I need a new username.Yet there is no place to enter a username.  That makes no sense.You call your 800 number and it says that your phones are down,sorry. Wait what?Yes I had to trick the system into saying I was trying to open an account to let me talk to someone.  Once I did get someone on the phone she was helpful.  But your instructions say I have to register to complete a transfer.  Your system literally will not allow that.  So stupid.  This is the worst user interface I have ever experienced.Do you even have people look at this before it goes into production?"
C BROWN,It was good experience with you. We really having patience to helping people. Thank you
CHARITY DRAKE,Respectful but incorrect information regarding my account.  They have a very long recording that you must listen to prior to choosing an option. Very frustrating when non of the recording pertains to you and when  you call back

Ben,"The young lady who assisted me in getting the information I needed to rollover my 403B was more than helpful. She was kind, patient and knowledgeable about my needs."
Ana,"Phone greeting is very dated and should be shorter. Web site is not clearly organized. The switch to a new web site required customers to sign up for a new account, which is very poor customer service. I did not receive any notice about the new web site and requirement to establish a new account, so I struggled to sign into my account until I finally contacted Millinneum. The annual fee fir IRA accounts is high, based on the services provided. I would not recommend Millinneum to others."
Sarah Fisher,Customer service is good just the site is not phone friendly.
Sean F.,For some reason I could not finish my app kept Messing up and ended or going back to the beginning
ANGELINA CADAVONA,"The person that I spoke to was very helpful and patient, he stayed on the online until the process was finished"
Sarah Biggio,"Worst company imaginable. Said they “reassigned “ our asset during pandemic , but nothing came to us except 2 very large 1099s. So social security believes we owe big bucks on assets that disappeared. Please watch that they mail you a bill but never an account review"
KIM BRYANT,"The online process is not very thought out.  I filled out the IRA form, but need to attached additional support to complete the process.  I don't see the option on the website to continue the application process as where I left off.Follow up:The IRA application was processed within a day.  Subsequently, I was able to register and get my credentials.  Within the user portal, I was able to complete the application process by submitting the additional documents.  Updating from 2 to 3 stars.  My initial feedback stands.  Within that 24 hour period, I was not sure how to complete the application process.  There weren't adequate instructions."
Koltyn Townsend,Friendly and responsive Great service

Melissa P,"Great, speedy and reliable services."
LIZA MELVIN,"Masheria is AMAZING in customer service, and helped me through all my account questions and forms."
B_Ohio,Antiquated company policies. Bank and money transfers couldn’t be more time consuming. Clearly a way to have you keep your money in here. Luckily I got it out because their fee structure is intense. I doubt anyone would willing put their money here unless it came from an employer. Do yourself a favor open a fidelity or vanguard account.
S. Matt,This is one of the best trust companies I seen so far.
Ricardo Tuquero,When attempting to close my account - I have found that I have had to jump through many more hoops than say Fidelity.
M Bice,Great communication and resolved all my questions

ROBERT RUDOLPH,The process was fast and efficient. The time on the phone was short and the disbursement of funds was quick as well.
LOURDES NUNEZ,"Called for assistance, first rep was very rude, in her frustration saying, “You just need to read and follow directions!”  Come to find out it was a computer problem, I read very well! On the phone for hours no one could resolve my issue.  Manager said she would call back never did.  I received no notification that my money was transferred, I had to set up all my account information after I tracked down where my money went.  Poor customer service.   I hope that rep can READ THIS!!  Your service is horrible!  Closing that account ASAP, will rollover where people appreciate my reading abilities.  I don’t want a trustpilot.com account either!"
LEE PRESLEY,"Customer service over the phone is pretty bad. I got nothing but a bad attitude and a person who was not answering my questions, nor cared about my concerns. I cant wait until I can transfer my funds out of this company and into my current retirement plan company so I don't have to deal with them anymore. I would never willingly use this company."
Michele Anderson,"Very nice and helpful, He knew everything I was talking about and guided me to the right direction. I think he did and awesome job."

CARMEN MARCHANTE,I was able to talk to someone that was courteous and helpful step by step through the process. Thank you
Lourdes Sanchez,"They charge you a ton of fees just to hold your money and not do any form of investing for you. I can only imagine how much they charge if they actually did some work. Never use this company, you'd be better off playing the lottery"
KRYSTAL GIANNAMORE,I find the fees associated with any activity practically immoral.  Fees for paper statements? Fees for closing accounts?  And many others...greedy!  Get your money out while you can!
CHRISTOPHER BLACKBURN,I had an excellent call with Tanisha (I'm not sure I've spelled it right) but she was courteous and knowledgeable. It was an easy call with a solid action plan to move forward. CheersAmos
PAULETTE RUTLEDGE,"i was so pleased with how easy this whole process was.

CASSANDRA HUNT,I've provided all required information to get my money yet these crooks and their worthless customer service representative won't give me my money.  My next step is to contact my attorney and take them to court.

Thank you, thank you. Everything worked out from our phone call to finishing up. Great customer service."
Michael Kerr,The website is very user unfriendly. I got frustrated when I could not change my investment. I use another investment site that I have no problem navigating. Wish this one was easier to navigate and so research.
ALEJANDRO LOPEZ,"The person I spoke with was very helpful and professional, and setting up my account online was easy.  I was closing an old 401k account that was being held by Millennium Trust and the turnaround was very quickly done.  Nice, professional and efficient company to deal with."
BRANDI JACOBS,There are a lot of terrible companies out there that steal and lie to their clients daily. This is probably one of 5 companies I've ever dealt with that hasn't done those things to me. My experience with Millennium Trust has been brief yet easy.

DANIEL RIGNEY,"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I called due to having trouble accessing my account. From the second i got on the phone with someone i was met with distain and an overall burden that i was calling. Attitude over questions i had. the second their office ""closed"" SHE HUNG UP ON ME! are you serious MTC? i will go out of my way to tell people about my experience. Im closing my acct."
ym,Thank you. Very helpful and informative on the phone. Gave me all the info I needed
Shova Pathak,The process is long and drawn out. Other companies like Fidelity and others would never make one go through such processes.
MARC LAZICH,"The associate who helped me really could not give an acceptable answer as to WHY I couldn't make the trade I desired.  The fact that i could not make the trade by Millenium rule is not what I'm debating, it's the inability to tell me why that has me very concerned"
DONALD TRAMMELL,Easy transaction. Got concern handled promptly.
TODD VERDUN,The person was very helpful with each of my questions.

JAMES WILLIAMS,Exelent atention thank you
RENAULD LANGHAM,The associate was very helpful in every way thank you
GERALDINE SHOEMAKE,Only took 4 days for the check to come here when I needed it most.
LELAND GOSHA,"My employers rolled my Wells Fargo 401k to Millennium when I resigned due to the pandemic. I do not recommend this company at all, they are not a real bank. I had no choice in this company, my former employer picked them. It's like my employer picked this company to add salt to a wound. Their fees are excessive, $35 to open the account (with my money), I will pay another $25 to Millennium to wire my money into a Rollover IRA until I find a new job. If I instead wanted a total distribution, they charge a massive percentage fee on top of the tax penalty fee and their account closing fee. Yes, that's 3 separate fees. The new financial institution I will be using does not charge yearly fees or fees to open the account, and they allow you to transfer to a new IRA without charging more fees. Plus, however Millennium is managing my account is terrible, it has lost money even though the market is improving. Whatever you earn in interest here, you will lose much more than that in fees. I've worked in banking, and this company is just terrible. Plus, when I called customer service, the employee just referred me back to the website. Why even have a call center then if we're forced to figure it out online anyway? She didn't understand their own fee schedule. Please choose a more well known institution who actually acts as your fiduciary, not to line their own pockets."
Marshall Vidrine,Customer service was great and helped out a newbie like me understand the whole process nice and easy
Julie Overbey,"I called about a very old account, about which I had few details.  They confirmed my identity, thoroughly but pleasantly, and then sent me an email link so that I could through a series of web screens to get out my money and close the account. That process was also clear and well-done. I'm happy with them."
JOSEPH WALKER,Great service. Fast!
LATRICE KIMMIE,CSR was rudeYour procedures are arcane and only benefit youYour fees are excessiveI had no choice when it came to funds being transferred to you and you charged high fees on a low balance account and had me do all the work setting up the account
Joshua Lees,"I didn’t like the extensive procedure to receive my payment/disbursement, but after three attempts to receive the funds in my account, a lady guided me through the process to get my money."
JAMES LOFTHUS,"Excellent service!I was able to quickly reach a customer rep on the phone, who was helpful and promptly completed my service request."

DUCKENS MERISMA,Marquis and Katy were great! Thx!
MONA W.,Great service and was walked through the online process. Representative did a great job.
JOHN BUCKLEY,"To be honest I thought the letter claiming I had funds was a hoax. After some research I called and everyone at Millennium Trust was helpful, patient, and responsive. I opted to take a distribution as it was not a substantial amount left over from a past employer. Within 2 weeks I had a direct deposit for 600 plus. I thank Millenium Trust for contacting me as this account was from 10 plus years ago and the original holder of my IRA funds made no such effort."
GUILHERME CURY,After verifying information I still could not get infomration I needed. closing account.Had to create an account and now need to wait for a statement.

KAYLA BURTON,Very awesome people. Easy to talk to.
ANITHA VIMALRAJ,"I do understand having safety measures in place but you make it to complex to get your own funds. It should not take hours, weeks or months to make any kind g of transactions due to the complications of getting into you own account.  I would advise working a better and uncomplicated way to work your system."
Kay Hendrickson,Great customer service. I was able to access my money when I needed it most.
Christina,Millenium Trust has been great! The site is so easy to use! I am able to easily do what I want with my money!
PAUL LATOUR JR,"My 401k appears to frustratingly be locked up. I've attempted to roll it over several times now since early 2019 and it keeps getting blocked for various reasons. Even asking for help over the phone and directly connecting them with Vanguard has ended without transfers.What is puzzling to me is that I've successfully rolled over a half dozen other similar 401ks to the same Vanguard IRA account! All from different institutions. Overall, I'm frustrated with Millennium Trust and would strongly not recommend."
KIMBERLY HAMSON,Very helpful and very timely in helping me with my account you guys are doing great from what I've seen.
JASON SNYDER,Thank you for helping me fast in my time of need
GREGORY BROOKS,"Millennium trust company worked with Transamerica to have several accounts transferred. Even after all the paperwork I submitted to NOT  have that process completed, Millennium still took my funds and now I’m cleaning up the mess in order to get my funds Where they should have gone in the first place. They basically kept sending me online to fix my issues and back to the other companies for them to deal with it, when they are actually the ones holding my funds. They offered no help outside of their basic website and MINIMAL customer service."
Luciana Burse,Working online with Millennium Trust was very rewarding. They reached out to me when i needed to add more information and were very helpful. It has been a great experience. I thank you and your team.
TRINA GERALD,"Excellent assistance from David.  He answered my questions and provided me exactly what I needed, plus walked me through the online process."

KATHryn,"Helpful, knowledgeable, friendly staff! Thank you"

G FLORES,"Overall, worse on boarding experience possible. No actionable “next steps” after account confirmation, no status or progress indication, no helpful information on how to submit any missing/required document, no upload links, no email contact, nothing!!!How in the world can this be considered “acceptable” experience?How long will this take, where’s my account, how do I see my money or my progress? Absolute disaster!!! Will be pulling out funds and moving elsewhere."
CallunaV,The receptionist was good however I feel it should nor take a few days to request my funds
MELISSA NIEDZWIECKI,"Excellent customer service. No hold time, the phone was answered instantly. Guidance offered was excellent."
KEITH JONES,Was very helpful told me step by step what to do and how to retrieve it so thank you!

CHRISTINA NIUAMOA,Good they don't need any changes
Tavares,"I just have to thank, Mayra, Carolina and Jessica. they were well patient and professional with me. keep the good work. thanks."
NANCY ANDERSON,"I called to retrieve my full account number. After 30 minutes on the phone, I cannot get that without creating a login and then fill out paperwork to send back. She verified who I was on the phone! These 2 accounts I have are from an employer 18 years ago. Y’all take fees out but there is no investing being done.  So it sits and y’all take fees. I just wanted my account number so that I could roll over to my existing portfolio. Now I have to send y’all a photo I’d with signature and passport info.  I hate my old company sold my account to yours. Very unhappy and dissatisfied. Just want my money and y’all can’t give to me."

HAYAT/SAADYA,The customer service was great and easy to work with. Thank you.
MARIE CASBURN,Grateful for the support to find funds from previous employment and IRA’s!
Lisa Wilks,"The Millennium Trust rep and I did not communicate well.  She was incredibly confusing and shared unnecessary information.  I called for a statement and have yet to receive it.  The email she sent me took me to the website, but I do not see a statement.  Wasted call and wasted time."
LADONNA KNABBS,"I believe I spoke with Priscilla in regards to transferring my current fund to new employer fund and she was incredibly helpful. Though there are instructions online about how to do so, they were not as clear and concise as I was hoping. Hence, I contacted Mileennium Trust via phone and was given straightforward instructions and quality customer service which is not always easy to find these days. Thank you for all of your help!"
BRANKA POPLONSKI,Excellent communication. My situation was solved fast and professional. Without weird lingo or stuff that a person that is not in this type of business can understand. I truly appreciate your prompt help and easy to navigate portal. Thank you again.

John Robeson,I spoke with customer service and she was very very patient and helpful with me . And we figured out the issue in a matter of minutes
Anonymous,Phone help was a great knowledgeable gentlemen
Deng Deng,My 401k rollover to consolidate my accounts was easy and efficient.
James,Your rep was fine. However my problem wasn’t solved. I can’t tell on your transaction page who my dividend is coming from / which investment. The answer I got is other clients have this problem. We will fix this. However doesn’t seem to be a sense of urgency as I couldn’t get an answer as to when this will be fixed and my request to have this prioritized was practically ignored. Overall disappointing!!
roman,Not sure if I really requested or not webpage is hard to maneuver around
Sally K,I appreciate your business. Keep up the good work.
Will,Very easy to complete distribution forms online. Very quick service.
THOMAS ,Not very user friendly.
Stephanie Martin,Was unable to login into new system.  Person I talked to led me through the steps and explained exactly what my problem was.  Company had not fully explained the new login requirements so I was continuously getting error message.

LENDY CERNA CARIAS,YOUR PROCESS TO GAIN ACCESS IS RIDICULOUS
BRIAN,"very good, professional service"
Tresa Haley,"I would recommend that the training of employees strengthens as, today, it is inconsistent. When calling in to initiate an IRA withdrawal, I was instructed by a couple of employees as to how to accomplish this. Unfortunately they were not consistent. I was frustrated and disheartened at my last conversation as this employee was telling me I had to do something, even more, to get my money out, when, in reality, I did not."
ABC,Never really used this. But from ehat i saw everything looked easy to navigate
Jessica ,Tasha and Jackie were awesome. Pay them well because they have great voices for financial sales.
M. TAYLOR,"My previous employer got acquired, so my 401K account was rolled over to Millennium Trust automatically, what a bad choice! Everything costs money. They charge $40 per year even if you don't do anything, and a paper statement fee of $12. And if you want to close your account, there is another charge! Not to mention that the sign-up process is complex and you have provide hard copy of the transfer form with your signature if you want to transfer your account out. Once I mentioned to my financial advisor that I wanted to move the account from Millennium, I was warned that they were one of most difficult company to work with."
ROBERT LEE,Charlene was so wonderful in helping with this.  Thank you!
LEAH PERKINS,Gwen was extremely helpful in assisting me in navigating the new portal
MADEEHA ALMASHHADANY,"I called to discuss an inquiry.  The service rep was courteous, efficient and effective."

Robert Parton #1965386,This is the worst experience ever.  I will never recommend millennium trust
Matthew Weyrum,Excellent service. Thanks!JVP
RHIANNON HESTER,"I had difficulty with the online forms - the form kept on reloading and would not work and the site sent 50+ emails saying this.  When I contacted the company, I was told it was my problem because my internet wasn't working (not something wrong with the website).  I was also told that there was no way to do anything other than online by the first representative.  Needless to say my internet was working (as evidenced by the 50+ emails).  When I got through to the manager, she was very helpful and willing to help and we got the issue resolved.  I ranked this poor because of the website is less than user friendly (having done most of my banking / investments online for years), the initial interaction on the telephone was horrible.  Saving graces, they answered the phone quickly, and when I got through to the manager she was very helpful."
FRANCETTA GUAJARDO,I had a wonderful experience when contacting the folks at Millennium Trust. They talked us through the process of what we were trying to accomplish.
Shatora Dublin,Great and helpful
KRISTOPHER ARSENAUX,"My employer rolled over my retirement account into Millenium. When I left the company, this was not clear, and gaining access to my accounts has been an extreme nightmare. Once I finally jumped through all the hoops to access my accounts, there were no statements in the system. A statement is required to make any sort of transfer. To view the statement, you have to surpass a bot, request the statement, wait for an email, then CALL the company to get a password to open the email. All for an account that has existed for two years. This is absolutely absurd and I am so glad I'm finally making the steps to remove my funds from this institution that wants nothing more than to put barriers between individuals and their own money."
JUSTIN ,Great experience!  The person I spoke with was courteous and knowledgeable. She helped me do everything needed to do.
Rodrigue,It was not easy to get my online account set up. The forms section is also not easy. I need a statement and still waiting for one to generate.
LAWANNA LONG,After I left a company my 401(k) was moved to millennium trust and put in a fund that wouldn't gain money. It was really difficult to figure out where my money was and how to do what I needed to move it or take it out. I decided it was best to roll it over to my new company's 401(k) and finally made it happen.
EBONY KIZZEE,Online portal was fast and easy to understand
SHERRY SPRAGGS,"Very responsive and helpful during our call. Most of the businesses I interact with try to get me off the phone as quickly as possible, but with Millennium I feel like it was exactly the opposite trying to help in any way possible."
KATELYN GUINN,The most dishonest and thieving investment company ever. How can you take a $35 fee without any disclosure being sent notifying the customer before you take the fee out. I am taking my money once I get an account setup and going to a reputable company like Vanguard.
CASEY SANBORN,"I called for some assistance and with general questions.  I was having trouble accessing information, and wasn't certain whether it was my computer, the website or, to be honest, my my own lack of knowledge. I reached a real live person easily and quickly. She was very patient and made me feel at ease; I never felt rushed or that I was wasting her time. She offered suggestions and waited calmly while I went through the steps she recommended. She answered all my questions clearly and with understanding. She emailed me some info and offered tips for future reference. She also offered additional help when I was able to access the paperwork and instructions. Overall, she was very warm, genuine and helpful and made our conversation a joy instead of a chore."
RUTH KENYON,The individual answering the phone calls wasn’t very people friendly and quite short dealing with inexperienced client 😞
April Munoz,"We have some extreme medical needs and just want to cash in this transferred account as it has only been losing since being moved by OSU from the TIAA CREF account that actually grew over these nearly three decades despite no additional funds being added from that one year.  PLEASE release our funds.  I have retired prematurely and have awful teacher's retirement here in Oklahoma.  It seems every corner, folks are grabbing the very meager savings that we NEED NOW."
alvino lewis,Web site easy to review and easy to request closure of the account with auto bank deposit
THOMAS WEAVER,"Customer service was great, answered all my questions."
ERICA,My agent was extremely helpful and patient!
LEVELL KEYS,Contacted me about an old IRA from years ago. Did some checking to make sure it wasn't a scam and a week later the money was in my account. Very pleasant surprise.

Kurt,Awesome so far we will see if I get my money
MICHAEL FANO,"Have been working with Millenium Trust for several years , very efficient very professional staff. great company to work with"
Sandra Richardson,The inadequate and vague responses I have received after informing the representative years ago still to this day have not been addressed.My name still appears with my maiden name and I still cannot address the small funds I have in the traditional ira from a past employer wth Millennium to decide what I would like to do with the funds from here.At this point I want to be able to login the portal after having updated again my personal information (all documents were submitted to do this) so that I can withdraw the funds and reinvest it elsewhere to grow along with my other investments.The only good service was with the last representative in the last week who really tried to help me get to the bottom of this issue.  For her I am grateful.
Laura D.,"I was transferring my traditional IRA account to a CD in a IRA account. Ty Watkins was so helpful patient, informative and professional.  It was a process made simple by his his expertise. I would recommend Ion B and to others."
DAISHA DUCKSWORTH,"On 4/23/21 I called Millennium for assistance with a rollover to another account. I spoke with Masheria who helped me create an online acct with Millennium so that I had access to what I needed. She had me make sure I was up and running before we hung up. She thoroughly explained what needed to be done, how to go about doing it, and advised she'd email me instructions, which arrived immediately.  She was very friendly, didn't make me feel like she was trying to get me off of the phone quickly, and answered all of my questions. Thank you Masheira!"

JODI LEWANDOWSKI,"Easy and relatively fast to withdrawal my IRA. Fees a little high. Also not fun trying calculate tax penalties for money I forgot I even had.Had to withdrawal because it was from a previous employer, and eventually Millenniums fees would have drained it if I just kept it there not actively gaining. But some is better than none. I prefer to invest in stocks and crypto on my own without a big brokerage company. My gains are greater even without an employer match."

KIM OLIVER MOORE,Millenium Trust is not a company you want to do business with. My money was sent to them by another trust company without my knowledge and they have been taking my money with the excuse of annual fees and processing fees. These people will rip you off and take your money.
JBC,Trying to do a withdrawal by direct deposit and it’s my money and you say up to 3 business days and still nothing?!?! A little strange…You should be to able to do or get your money if you request and do everything necessary they request of you but I’m still waiting…I don’t find it nice to say that’s not the way a company should be handling your own money you earned and who knows when you get it?!
ARIAN PETERSON,Had an IRA for about 2 years and only had a $13.50 gain :| even in today wild market I had less than a half percent gain.
