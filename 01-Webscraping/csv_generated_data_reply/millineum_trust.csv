Great Company & Customer Service,Millenium has been extremely helpful from the very beginning of my experience. They send reminder emails & give step by step directions. The customer service representatives were also very friendly & informative.,5
Log-in Issues,"I called because I needed to figure out an issue with logging in. The man I spoke with was extremely helpful, and efficient. He was able to quickly send a new email, and problem was solved in under 5 minutes. It's always refreshing talking to someone who is a competent helper. Much appreciated.",5
Use another company,My current financial advisors have attempted multiple times to transfer this money into my accounts and have been denied each time. This has forced me to withdraw the money AND take penalties on it. I am very unhappy and would never recommend this company to anyone.,1
The representative I spoke to was UTTERLY PERFECT! He deserves so much praise and a raise!,"The representative I spoke to was beyond helpful. Above and beyond kind, this is my first time with a 401k and he was truly so information and so kind. I hope his boss gives him this praise because he really made my day and helped me endlessly",5
You can improve by not being greedy asâ€¦,"You can improve by not being greedy as heck. My old company transferred my account to you without my knowledge,  i applied for a roll over immediately and you are charging me 25 $ to send my money where i need it. Ridiculous.",1
My money was put into you your trustâ€¦without my permission,My money was put into you your trust without my permission. You charge me to put it into and to take it out. It is a very small sum as your funds go with no interest earned. Tell me why I should be a happy camper with your organization. You people are a bunch of Shysters.,1
This investment company has the worstâ€¦,"This investment company has the worst fee's possible. I was charged 10 dollars a statement i never received. If your looking to retire through IRA account, steer clear of these guys. Customer service was great though..ðŸ˜‚..",1
"Helpful Customer Service, Slow Processing Time","Customer service has been very informative and helpful. Old company I worked for transfered my account into Millennium Trust after a few years of not working there. The one downside I experienced is the lengthy processing time of withdrawing your funds, wasn't expecting to have a 10+ day delay so I could move my funds to my portfolio. Other than that the short experience with them was good.",4
Idiot's. Exactly what's wrong w this country,I had 9k in an ira. They contact me when there 1800. Left.... Than give me crap about my bank account. W.t.f. has checks. Special place in hell for you people,1
My 401K from my old job was trasfer â€¦,"My 401K from my old job was trasfer  here before I even had a chance to deal with the 401K. The amount was $2226 dollars and I was charged $25 to close the account. All I wanted was my mo ey, but you had me jumping through so many hoops just to get it, you might as well keep all of it.",1
All my questions were answered,"My experience was a satisfying one. All my questions were answered, and the representative was helpful getting me information I requested. Thanks!",5
It  took numerous attempts to connectâ€¦,It  took numerous attempts to connect with a live agent and not a chat bot.  I was interested in knowing how long a distribution takes.  A suggestion for the future would be to add a time frame to any  correspondence.  Why does it take 15 business days to push buttons for an ACH transaction is a question that i have.,3
Overall service was horrible,"Overall service was horrible, no money was invested and only fees were taken for no real reason.  Worst banking and investment company I have ever dealt with and I use T. Rowe Price, Charles Schwab, Fidelity and USAA.  HorribleAdded - yes, I understand the regulations but the $10 cash sweep fee for pennies quarterly, $25 annual fee, closing fee and no investment of any kindâ€¦again, just fees until it dwindles away.  Shame on my previous employer for not just cutting a check and sending it to me.",1
Lack of communication,"I have been attempting to register my account with Millennium Trust for months now, and every step has led to more confusion and misunderstanding. While the associates on the phone are very friendly, every form I submitted was responded to with a phone call telling me I missed a step I had never even known about. Overall communication regarding what should have been a simple process was extremely lacking.",2
Amazing!!,"The agent, Donna, that assisted me was very helpful, polite and professional. I left that employer 20 years ago and wasnâ€™t aware I even had this IRA. I had my distribution within 5 days of application.  Well done Millennium Trust!",5
Long wait time on hold,"I needed to verify a second account to view its balance online.  There is no self service option for this in the portal, my wait time for a representative was approximately 30 minutes, far too long.   The representative I spoke with was friendly, but sounded exhausted and overwhelmed.    It seemed like your call center was not adequately staffed.",2
Lisa was wonderful,"Lisa was wonderful.  She didn't just give directions, she went through the process step by step until completion.  She should be commended for her knowledge and patience.",5
Customer service,They are very understanding and easy to work with. They help you in any way they can and do their job very thoroughly and fast.,5
Terri was my CSR,"Terri was my CSR - she was polite, professional, helpful and informative. While in the first 3 minutes of the call we were disconnected - she promptly called me back to finish our conversation. Stellar customer service!!!",5
Luis at the help center was FANTASTIC,"Luis at the help center was FANTASTIC.  He listened to my issue, explained how to solve the problem, and took the steps to do so, all while I was on the line.  And it only took a few minutes.",5
