Vicki Stearman,"My experience with Quick Credit in Camden,SC for refinancing my loan was excellent. The loan process was done in a timely manner; between 15 - 20 minutes. The communication was respectful and courteous both with the person over the phone and in office. The method using electronic documents saves a lot of time from the traditional way of hand-signing and initialing several hard copy documents that also provides a soft copy for my personal records through the agency‚Äôs portal. Under the new management, members are now offered more funding that helps tremendously in the new way of life with an economy striving to build back better during the end of the COVID-19 pandemic which is so important with help paying rent or mortgage, car maintenance or repairs, buying groceries and other goods, and any other related financial crises to make ends meet. Overall, the atmosphere in the office is very clean and pleasant. The staff was very friendly, professional as well as very informative with addressing any questions or concerns I had about my loan. I would definitely recommend anyone interested in getting a loan to apply from Quick Credit for receiving exceptional customer service in a very pleasant and comfortable business atmosphere. Are you guys hiring? This is a wonderful place to work to help others."

Kelsey was patient with me understood me and done anything she could to help me out. So she made it possible for Covington Credit to get my repeat business. Thank you Kelsey!"

And it still took almost 30 minutes and new information has changed. So why did it take that long of time to redo a loan with all same info. Didn‚Äôt feel like the process and my time is worth the renewal. I will just pay this off and not take anymore money out. At least not using Covington Crwdit."

A very friendly group of ladies. I have other loans but Covington Credit has the lowest rates & my payments are really low. Thanks for the help,  V. Duffie"
allcountrylisa,I had gone there a few days ago. One of their systems went down so I could not have a contract written for me. Then a few days later while I was there trying to get the contract signed there systems went down again so that they could collect all of the deposits for the day. I was told that this is a normal thing. They need to tell customer's when they apply for a loan that the office will be shutting down starting at 4 in the afternoon and won't be available till after 4:30. I was not expecting this at all. I had to rush to the bank because of this. I also was unaware of the fact that they require collateral for the loan. No one mentioned this to me over the phone when I called to talk about getting a loan. Covington Credit mis represented itself.

Monica Davis,Southern Finance was very helpful with great customer service during the loan.
Sabrina Edrington,When I first went to Southern Finance back 3-4 years there was a lady I do not remember her name that helped me. She was awesome and very thorough with the terms and everything that I needed to be able to receive a loan. I've never gone for a loan before and I was in a bind. Since then I have renewed my loan with Southern Finance because they have treated me like family. If I was ever late with a payment they worked with me. Over the last year or so I've been talking with a gentleman named Mr. Whitt. another awesome employee that they have. I have gotten ill and couldn't make my payment and of course he worked with me. He has called me to check in with me make sure everything was all right and of course he asked me when I would be able to make that payment but he was very concerned not just for their payment but for me as well. They're not like most loan places they don't call you everyday bugging you for your payment. I will continue to deal with the Southern Finance crew of Orangeburg. They're wonderful people the do business with them.

Rene' Young,"What is great you can borrow money with a monthly pay back. During the time of your loan, you make timely payments and every second or third month, you are offered more money without affecting your monthly payment. Monthly payment stays same. If you are elderly and living on limited income this is great loan company."
Vanessa Mills,When I opened this loan account I was told that there would be insurance attached for if I ever lost my job or became disabled. I did in fact lose my job and contacted the company. I was told to come in and fill out paperwork and my loan payments would be taken care of until I returned to work. After a whole month since the time I notified the company of unemployment and was waiting for help on this I was told that I now owe two payments because I wasn‚Äôt out of work long enough. They even tried to tell me that my payment would be considered only once and I could not be late again without paying in full and I had a late payment. What a way to put your customer in a bind. I would NOT suggest ever doing business with this company!
Barbara W,"The staff at Covington credit is awesome! They gave me a chance after a divorce massacred my credit! This has helped me get my credit score back on track. They are always helpful and send friendly reminders when it‚Äôs about time for your payment to be made. Love doing business with them. Love their referral program also.

Woody Smith,Covington Credit offered a decent amount of money and gave a reasonable amount to re-pay. They don't have a Catastrophic 257% interest like some absurd lending companies. They're VERY fair with monthly payments. As long as you maintain them then there's no problem. Every year as long as you're a good customer there's a chance to raise what you can borrow. Naturally that means a higher payment but you don't Have to accept any increases and should only accept what you can responsibly afford. They report one-time payments so I guess that actually helps your credit rating over time with the Bureaus. Exceptional staff too!!!
Dean Large,The workers and help there giving me its great and quality ‚Ä¶ Its a great Loan Company . I‚Äôm satistified

Linda Spicer,I'm not sure of what's going on with Mandy but the last few times I've went in to pay on my loan she's had a very bad attitude. She's lost her patience. I guess the job is getting to her after all these years. She was walking around bare footed last time I was in there. I even referred my grand daughter to apply with her over the phone and my grand daughter said she was yelling at someone in the office so she changed her mind. Get it together Mandy before you loose customers like you lost the assistant manager Keith he was great! I'm sure the customers miss him now. It's just not the same.

I was actually headed to another company but thankfully their system was down at all Mobile locations so a friend took me to Covington.  The ladies were all great as far as performing their jobs and excellent customer service.  It took about 10 minutes to get approved.  I was actually planning to borrow a little less than what I got, but they start out at $250.00 as the lowest amount you can borrow.  I agreed to that because the payments for into my budget and I think the payback amount is quite reasonable.  Plus, I will be building my credit through all 3 credit bureaus.

Sandra Thomas,"They held the check THEY sent me in the mail until the 3 days grace period was up so I couldn't cancel or return the loan, then charged me $50 the day it hit my account 4 days later and blamed my bank! I never spent a dime of the loan or never even had access to the money until today yet they charged me $50 to give them the loan back in full! This is a scam beware this company is shady! I'd advise going to Security Finance! Better loans better policies and nicer people to work with. Covington ripped me off $50 bucks down the drain for nothing! They just threaten to put it on my credit if I didn't pay them the loan amount plus $50 even tho I cancelled the loan and never got the money from them! Extort their patrons! And I was a good paying customer for several loans in the past and that's how they treat their patrons? Never again.."

However, I wasn't right in this case and I had toapply to loan companies. I have picked this company and t remained only positive emotions after communiation with its represntatives.

Felicia,"This is probably one of the worst experience I had.  I see other people giving 5 stars, which I'm very surprised.  Either they didn't deal with lady I dealt with or there is a reason why this lady was very rude to me.  The loan I received was only $385 and she asked for a credit card statement, my car insurance statement, all with my address on them.  She also asked for my check stub, which is normal, but since it didn't show YTD on my check stubs, she got rude about it.  It seemed like she did not want to give me a loan, probably thought she could be rude to me since she could say yes or no to the loan.  So, I had to talk to her supervisor about what was going on.  I told her supervisor that I have given her all the paperwork she asked for, I did not question why she wanted my car insurance and a credit card statement, which nobody asks for.  The supervisor was very nice and professional and apologized for this ladies attitude.  The supervisor asked me to make screenshots and to bring up my work app, which has the check stubs.  So, I logged into the app and let that lady look at the check stubs.  Then she said that she could not use it since the company name and my name and address would not show up of she tried to print it.  It seemed like she was trying to find a reason to not give me a $385 loan, again, a $385 loan.  It wasn't like I was getting a $5000 loan.  So, I had to go into my works intranet and show her my check stubs from there, it was well after their closing hours when we were going through this.  So, when I showed her those check stubs and she made screenshots, she said she couldn't send them to her email, she said the email network was messing up.  Like I said, it seemed like she didn't want to give me a $385 loan, again, a $385 loan, lol.  Her supervisor told her to send it to her email address, which went through.  So, after I made my screenshots of my car insurance and emailed to her supervisor, that's when I finally got my $385 loan.  That is why I'm surprised this place got 5 stars.  She could have had a bad day, I don't know, but she had that attitude that she could be anyway towards me.  I'm just glad I was able to talk to her supervisor.  This lady doesn't need to be dealing with customers with that kind of attitude, not nice at all.  This is why I'm surprised this place got 5 Starz from more than one person, and all I got for a loan was $385.  I went through all that for $385, even if it was for $2000, her attitude should not have been that way."

brian wright,"Amber & the ladies @ Covington in Corsicana have been taking care of my financial needs for many years now, even back to the previous managers Vickie & Evelyn. They answer the phone EVERY TIME, on the first or second ring. They are quick & efficient in pulling up my information, & ALWAYS take my payments expeditiously. With my working multiple jobs, I am often traveling in between locations, so they offer to call me back when needed, & follow through.I have been a specific client of Amber's, her attention to personal & often private information is exceptional. She always asks, ""How are you with xxx situation?'  or ""How did xxx work out for you?"" Most recently the office reached out to me with a financial offer, & I had just lost a Hospice client I was working for in taking care of just 2 hours earlier. I was quite distraught in this 'passing', & Amber reached out to check on me a little later that day. It's CUSTOMER SERVICE, but more importantly, the KNOWKEDGE of clients, that will CONTINUE my turning to Covington Credit in Corsicana for my financial needs!!!Thank you ladies of Covington, you are  ALL GREATLY APPRECIATED!!T.

VG,"I signed my requisite paperwork last Friday before the 11 am cut-off. Appears that the corporate office suffered some sort of power failure on Friday afternoon and they could not complete the transfer on Friday before 5 pm. Monday was a Federal Holiday and I was told that the deposit would be made prior to the end of the business day on Tuesday. It is now Tuesday evening at 9:00 pm and still there is no sign of a deposit. I called the Perrin-Beitel office in San Antonio at 5 pm and was informed they would need to put in a ‚Äúticket‚Äù. That is there answer to everything, a ‚Äúticket‚Äù to the corporate office, as they don‚Äôt want to pick up the phone to call a higher authority. I informed them that I wished to cancel the loan because of their woeful inability to perform. The mindless response being, we‚Äôll put in a ticket in the morning. The overall employee talent pool is quite shallow, but obviously the incompetence begins much higher in the corporate pecking order. Don‚Äôt walk‚Ä¶run from this company!"
David Woodard,"Makes the world go round. ,Just when I need the extra Holiday cash or extra help on a bill etc,,,,. Love them."

I will say i have had tons of different styles of loans starting with student loans, payday loans, installment, title loans, pawn loans. I have used companies from lowcountry to the upstate. And out of every company  in The last 16 years, this has been by FAR the ABSOLUTE  best company i have done business with. First and foremost,  they have the lowest interest rate I've ever seen; even with a poor credit score (*under600). Secondly, most loans take atleast a year(or more) to pay off, however they have 7 month loans.  Third they report to all 3 Bureaus, helping improve your credit efficiently!! 4th They offer a $30.00 referrals  and last but most definitely NOT least they have THE SWEETEST, KIND, COMPASSIONATE staff whom also are very efficient  and they help you get through the  process faster than others i have worked with...The name ""QUICK CREDIT "" is perfect! Not only are they quick to help your credit score, but they are QUICK to get the process of applying for credit...The name is simple, but they are simply the best!"

Then after proving 9 months of payments on time you offer me a new amount jut want my life history and documentation on everything.  The proof should be in the pudding which is I paid on time every single time.  So I don‚Äôt understand that thinking or policy behind that?   Performance should be everything.

Heather G,I took out a loan at Covington Credit the staff was very nice I had a few issues but in time I want to add them out apparently I didn't like the collateral listing it was just way too much to me and I wish today submitted you cash instead of a check because you have to go get that either if you don't have a bank account have it cash which actually will cost you so I don't like that factor but I do like the fact that they do report your account to the credit bureau and with this that means that you can build your credit with this company and increase your score which I really like of course as long as you pay your bill on time one other factor I didn't really like or understand I have no access to actual documents they don't give me any documents and it's not like you can go online and download them either up alone I would like to have had that but she did say she will mail them so hopefully that'll happen but other than that it is a great place especially if you want to just find a place to really build your credit but just be aware that the loans are expensive and that is a factor to look at other than that it was okay deal

I was in a very tight spot financially this month and was actually, for the first time ever, not going to be able to pay my loan on time or possibly even pay it. Lyndon was very calm and extremely nice to me although because of stories I've heard about other finance companies, I thought I might get yelled at threatened or something like that (although the staff at Southern Finace has ALWAYS treated me with kindness and respect) but I wasn't yelled at. Lyndon listened patiently to me while I cried and then went out of his way to help me. I am so grateful. I also wanted to add that I called them yesterday, a Thursday when they close the office at 5:30 pm yet they still answered the phone and helped me from 6:30 pm until 7:00 pm!! I thought I was going to get their voice-mail. I will now, only use Southern Finance for any financial needs that I EVER NEED!! Thank you so very much!Sincerely, Angela McCabe"

All in all it cost me about $200 by not being able to make the payment that I needed to, After being assured by the representative that the funds would be there the same day"

I uave never before had trouble with refinancing until just recently.  It was all worked out and I was able to refinance and actually was able to get an even larger loan however I was confused when I was told they needed to do a hard pull on my credit this was a first.  They say the credit is based on the person not the score which must also be true but why my credit had to be pulled and why i had to list household items as collateral was a confusing first.

Sandy Thompson,"Well this is as honest as I can be since I have been with Covington which is a year the have been a blessing for me and my credit.   They have always thought of my needs if it was for my business, or at Christmas time, for example the last time I was there May 21 , I am in the process of building my home with this crisis we are facing materials are running high and I had to make a change which saved me some but OSB Borad use to be around $12.00 a sheet well with 5he rain we ha've had I had to trash some of MINE but I need about 10 sheets but the price of that same borad is now $47.00 so I had 5o run metal corrugated so the shor5 I spent over my limit. And my 99 was due on the 21 st co I call DestiNY was there so 5I save what I have with you guys she told me to bring in $99.00 a,d get there before 5:00 I got there 10 minutes after but it was on she was professional In all parts of her job. But what I was not expecting was the$119.81 in return for the payment and that enabled me to stay not owing anybody because I was able to pay back my neighbor back the 100 I borrowed from him so like o.o said I have never been late and usually pay two weeks before due date. And for me with three marriageMy credit went south along time ago.and I just didn't try but being 60 now and retirement on the horizon I need a little bit better score and you are keeping your end so am I. But I have nothing to say. Bad about. Covington or the people in your Sulpher Springs branch, The way they react to customers they make you feel comfortable ,even when the store was shut down for a period your people never missed a beat, all I have to say now is if you where a bank I would have an account with your Co.

If I so choose, and have on occasion, conducted my business over the phone. Personally, I like to go by the office just to see the ladies and hopefully make their day, as they always make my day better, just by being the caring folks they are.

My only concern is that my local office always seems a little understaffed.  Management appears to only have one person in the office lately to handle all the phone calls, appointments, and walk in traffic.  This can be quite overwhelming to the employees.  No wonder there appears to be a high turnover rate.  I have seen a few great representatives come and go.  Management should focus on employee retention to keep repeat customers like myself.Randy H."

I was crying and I didn't know what I was going to do. Ms. Nina was so kind to me and helped me out of the jam I was in. Not only that, she said that the loan payments would help my credit - and they did! I'm doing much much better and haven't been in the same kind of situation since. But I have continued to do business with them with small loans and manageable payments to help building my credit back up. And because I just love working with Ms. Nina and her staff. They also have been very thoughtful and careful with their clients during Covid, making payments and loan renewals even more convenient. If I could give them 50 stars, I would."

I went today (Feb. 26, 2021) to pay it back and found out that doing so was going to cost me $97.27 which is more than 1/3 of the total finance charge for the duration of the loan which was supposed to be 10 months. I am irate about this. This just disgusts me beyond words that a company would do that when people are struggling enough as it is but then charge someone almost $100 to pay off a loan that they had for 15 days. VERY BAD BUSINESS!!!!"

So I called them and asked if I could get a loan with them. They were very helpful. And they also do over the phone applications for you to get pre-approved instead of having to make a drive to see if you can actually get a loan with them. The application process is super easy, just a few simple questions. And when you get approved, all you have to do is go to the office, they go over the contract with you thoroughly, I already knew about everything cause I work in an industry like them. And after that, you sign the paperwork and they hand you a check of however much you were approved for and that‚Äôs all to it. And if you would like to make a payment online, they have that option and it‚Äôs super easy to use. I would definitely encourage other individuals that are in need of any kind of financial help to go visit the lovely ladies at Covington Credit."

Mary,Sadly after years of being a customer here I will no longer be returning. I first can me to a very welcome and attentive staff that was always on top of things. That was not the case this time around. I was told multiple times that I would receive a call back and had to call myself to see if my loan was approved. The manager was not in the first few times I called to review the status of my loan. Once I was able to reach the manager I was told my loan was denied. Due to new rules and regulations that they now follow. I have been a customer with Covington Credit in Beeville Texas for years and have never had this bad of service before nor was I updated about rules and regulations that they now follow. I receive multiple emails and mail from Covington Credit through out the year. Out of curiosity this would have been helpful to at the minimum know that there was changes made before anyone can do a loan here. It‚Äôs sad to see that this has gone downhill.

Louise Heyer,"Quick service, knowledgeable of their job, and great attitudes.  Personal loan eligibility was mid hard but passable. Loan rate very high but having a goal to pay off the loan should save customer some of the large finance charges. The monthly payment is a Pro, the amount is Pro however the small amount to borrow is a Con and the interest fee. I think this is going to be a great and fair company in this region."

Waylon Payne,They are nice people but  the interest rate is high and they will call you on the day your payment is due want to know what time you‚Äôll be there to pay it if for some reason you can‚Äôt pay it the day it‚Äôs due they will call everybody you put down as your references they will even call your references on their jobs they don‚Äôt care if they get in trouble or not most employers don‚Äôt want their employees to have personal phone calls but I will call anyway

Sharon BowmanSmith,Went in seem like a new portal but my payment was declined for whatever reason I‚Äôll have to try to call it in on your business days and timeValeria jackson 8646500157
Chloe Finch,"Very disheartening to refinance a loan. I signed electronic documents 1/19 and was told funds would be in my account 1/20. No funds!  I called, and instead of the rep saying let me research the issue she immediately assumed and asserted that I entered the incorrect information.  I was told they contacted home office and the funds would be in my account at 5:00 (the same time the office closes). It‚Äôs 5:30pm. No funds!   I guess I need to make adjustments to see if I can cancel this refinance of the contract.  very inconvenient with no sense of customer service and concern from the company.  Typical."
Angela Hawthorne,"I had such a wonderful experience with Covington. The vibe in the office is great. You walk in and theres good jams playing, it's so clean, it smells good and everyone greets you and tells you bye. Mr. Wallace and his ladies were so helpful and kind. Mr. Wallace really helped me in this very bad time I am going through. I cant explain how thankful I am to have received their help.-Whitney"
Branish ‚ÄúB‚Äù Reese,"(District manager contacted me after this review apoligized. Say that is not the way they want there customers treated and taking me off the call list and will have talk with Brian) Gave them second chance same crap due date 17 calling job and people on list on the 19th. Never again.2 years agoI have been with Covington credit for of an on for 3 years. I have refered 5 people to them and renewed loans with them on many an as needed bais.Today I got a call at my job one day after my due date this is an unexcepable practice. They pulled me away from my job to ask about payment. 1. I am not allowed to have personal calls at work. 2. One late day is not a reason to call someones job. 3. I dont want everyone at my job or the person answering the phone knowing my buisness. 4. I have done business with many of these types of loan companys and not one even the worst has a policy of calling your job or other people unless you are ignoring them for atleast a week or more. 5. 1 call was made to my personal phone and one message left 2 min before calling my job. I will be closing this account and will recomend all my referals do the same. this new policy is bs and the ""Manager"" Mr Wade was less than apoligitic and says this is how they do business."

Shawn Ash,I've used Southern credit many times and they're always courteous and easy to work with. The only problems I've encountered were from my own bank having their own technical issues not Southern credit nor my loan associate. In fact they helped resolve the issue or clarify with my bank on my behalf and things were soved before the end of the day.

Asia Mitchell,"When I called to make the last payment on my third loan ( your website wouldnt take it) I was offered a refinance which didn't surprise me as you have done this before in the form of checks and I have never paid late. After accepting I was then asked for collateral  ""WHAT"" I said...... on 500 dollars. He said things have changed. I jokingly offered my $ 30000. 1940 Buick but he said that was unacceptable. Something more on the line of power tools , tv's, household junk etc. If that wasn't humiliating enough I was then asked to provide a picture I.D. I assume to prove it was really me along with a current copy of of my bank statement. I assume to show I am not a deadbeat and can repay the loan. The iceing on the cake was the interest rate which was almost double. Therefore I will be repaying the loan in full on the first payment. That should free up your funds for  more homeless people."

So the next day i made my way downtown and met both women who were lovely and very easy going. The process was painless and simple. This time of year is always difficult but 2020 has made it even more so. I was so glad to have someone who answered my phone calls and helped me without making me feel like a burden. I had actually started the process elsewhere but felt put off, so was glad to be able to do everything in under an hour."

antwan Trimble,Today Nov. 9 2020 I received a call from Covington Credit in Greenville Texas. I spoke with Tamisha/Tanisha she mentioned I came due on the 6th. I told her I would have the money until next week she proceeded to lecture me about my payment claiming it was my first payment and I could not be late. I told her there is nothing I can do at this time. She proceeded to talk to me in an aggressive unprofessional tone which caused me to raise my voice in return. She literally asked what I did with my payment that was due on the sixth. I told her she had no right to ask me that and she said she did. I again explained to her I was not aware I was due and I would not have the money for at least a week. She and I got in a heated yelling match about my payment. I really thought I was not due until the 26th. Then she threatened me in a hostile belligerent tone with collection and I then finished the conversation by hanging up saying I am done with this conversation. I will pay it when I get the money. I do not have money growing on trees. I can't just pay whenever I am demanded too. Rest assure I will make my payment but not until around the 20th of this month.
Darren Dean,Very pleased with everything. Very grateful for the help.
