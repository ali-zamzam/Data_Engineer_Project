"Thank you for your review. We truly appreciate your suggestion and will take this into consideration for our next upgrade. However, we're pleased to tell you that we just recently started accepting debit card payments. To make a payment with a debit card, just give us a call at (888) 681-6811 to set it up. Be sure to check the Spotloan FAQ under ""how can I make a payment"" for more information."" Paying by debit card will shorten the reapplication process. Thanks again!"

"Hello Roderick and thank you for your review. BlueChip Financial, which does business as Spotloan, was a party to a recent class action settlement that was approved in federal court.  Like any settlement, this was a compromise of disputed claims.  It was not an admission of guilt or wrongdoing by Spotloan, nor was it a finding of liability against Spotloan.  On the contrary, Spotloan denies any liability or wrongdoing, and if the settlement was not approved, we would have vigorously defended the action.Please know that we work tirelessly to ensure full transparency to our customers. This is why we publish our interest rates and fully explain the terms of our product online. We believe that our customers should have an opportunity to review information about interest rates and what to expect before they apply, not after.  Please feel free to reach out to us directly at help@spotloan.com should you have any further questions."

"Hello Elaine. Thank you so much for acknowledging our fast service. At Spotloan, we pride ourselves in our ability to help customers with emergency expenses tied to rent, medical bills, or even car repairs. However, those loans do come at a high interest rate. Spotloans are not intended to solve longer-term credit or other financial needs, and alternative forms of credit may be better for you, including borrowing from a friend or relative;  using a credit card cash advance; taking out a personal loan; or using a home equity loan or savings."
Thanks for the positive review. Customers who are approved and confirm their loan before 10 a.m. CT (Monday through Friday) will receive their funds the same day. We agree - that’s convenient!

We also provide the ability for customers to pay on their loan for up to 10 months if they choose, which is more expensive than paying off early. We hope this information helps. If you have any questions or if paying your loan off early is an option for you, please feel free to reach out to one of our friendly customer service representatives at 1-888-681-6811 or via email to: help@spotloan.com."
