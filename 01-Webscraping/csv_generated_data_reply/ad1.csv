Evangelist AnniePearl Townsend,"Good Morning, My experience was great. But today is the 19th, of October 2022 and My daughter still haven't gotten her referral money üí≤üí∞ü§ë yet. They told her she would get it in her email ‚úâÔ∏èüì®. She very upset. Because they used to give it to you right then. I still need my money that I was promised to get for my referral."
David,"I had to have an emergency surgery for my dog Emmitt. The surgery was just under $3000 dollars. I was $700 dollars short and could not bare to put him down, the surgery was a must for him, he's my best pal. I drove to  Advance America and was given the $700 loan which posted to my checking account instantly. The Vet is paid and Emmitt is at home recovering. Thank you so much for the help! Emmitt says thanks too!"
Nirobi,"I recently went to the homestead location to get a loan and I was looking forward to getting all of my advance loan money back in cash. The cashier told me she didn‚Äôt have enough cash, and the cash register, so as she helping me a customer come in, so she asked him how can I help you? Customer paying back my loan he said a certain amount, and that‚Äôs the exact amount that she gave me back and that was not the full amount that I came in to get a payday loan."
Lenora,"Every time I have go in to the Laurel, MS office, I receive superb customer service. Just recently I encountered some financial hardship and was treated with excellent service and given the information to contact a representative via telephone call to defer payment. I appreciate Advance America excellent services."
Buck Bazhaw,"My first Re-Contact with Advance America was online. What a sham with poor customer service. Then I received an e-mail offering an installment loan, it made me mad. Then what do you know, Jerry from the Broken Arrow, Oklahoma store called me. He offered a potential solution, so I related my story. Jerry pulled up my data and read about my situation and was able to get me a loan at about 75%  of the original. I am a long-time customer and wanted to go to a competitor but Jerry saved my day and most likely yours."
Jorge Mercado,"Hazel the manager at the store is the sweetest and most professional customer service at this store. She goes beyond to provide excellent customer service, I have known her for over 6 yrs and she never changes always greets you with a smile and treats you like a family member. A big shout out to Hazel!!"

E. Campbell,"Good afternoon, I want to start out by saying that my online experience with the application process was great. The site is very user friendly, and the response was very timely. Overall GREAT EXEPRIENCE. I would also like to say I called your store on Countyline Rd in Ridgeland Ms. and spoke to a member of your staff before submitting the online application , and the customer service was wonderful I only wish I remembered her name. The entire experience was GREAT."

Mary K. Rich,"The Advance America employee is always professional and considerate...at least the one I dealt with this last time.  I did complain about one previous encounter.  I will say that I wish you had sufficient cash to provide when pay day advances are processed as this last time, the young lady asked if she could put the money on my debit card as she did not have sufficient cash.  I said yes without knowing that it would not hit my account until 24 hours after the first business day the advance was made.  Advance was made on a Saturday, money not credited to my account Tuesday.  I realize it is my banks issue/policy but it did not seem that I had any option."

Kimberly,"I truly hate to borrow money by getting a loan anywhere, but when I was hurting for money I was taking care of by Alicia there at the Festus location and since I didn't start my new Job Location (because I was in transition of transferring from my job from Florida) I wasn't working for a couple of months taking care of my father. So I needed Cash to cover me til I got my first check and Alicia helped me out and explained everything and was courteous and helpful in my desperate embarrassing situation. Even when I wasn't sure I what day I was going to get paid that week they let me know that I would be ok and gave me a day or 2 just in case. Then after I got my direct deposit from my job I came it to pay my payment in full and Alison took care of me and I decided to get another loan that was much easier for me to do and for some reason their system wasn't taking my bank account number and I thought I wouldn't be able to do it and Alison was so patient and helpful and we both figured that I was missing 2 digits extra and she put it in and it worked (besides I learned something new to make sure I have the 2 other digits I need for my account lol ) I really enjoyed these 2 ladies professionalism and courteous attitudes they shown and understanding of my situation. I really appreciate it cause it goes along way. Can't thank them enough and will recommend other's who are in their own situations."

Yolanda Glenn,"I payd off my first loan in Fremont Ohio way early. I thought this would allow me more additional credit. I went to Michigan where on Hoover Rd michigan applied for a loan they approved me for only the same as before, $200 they processed a payday loan . The manager at this store promised I be able to go to a additional store in Michigan and be alloud to borrow a second loan . I travel there to my surprise they would not allow me a second loan . Then once to Ohio, the sore in lasky told me I was able to have one on line loan to my surprise I did every thing they ask of me and the in line sure would not give me the  option to borrow. I'm very upset and discouraged in the lack of correct procedures and running me on a goose chase it felt. I am still wondering why my one payday loan is in Michigan why I can borrow in Ohio now ??"

Joshua,I have been a customer since 2016 and I am glad they offer online services but i prefer face to face.  I needed money in my bank account on a weekend and unfortunately for some odd reason i got licked out of my online account.   Because I was not able to access my customer service about my account until a business day my bank charged me overdraft fees at 29$ each had I been able to access my online account I would not have overdrafted.I much prefer the personal touch that occurs in the store.  Unfortunately the local store closed so I was forced to go the online option.  I live the fact that I dont have to fill out a new application every time I reloan. Just check a box and submit. Its that easy. I love the ease of it. Thank You

Martin,"In the last few months i have had such a problem using the online system to get my loan.  It often will not verify my income even though you have all the info and are getting into my checking account.  I have noticed quite a few times when I try it will get to the page that shows my total monthly income of my social security disability but on the same page it shows my 3 month and it is too low so not sure if that has anything to do with it.  This month I must have tried 4 times kept ending up saying to upload documents and I gave up. Plus then stopped at the local office and they were out to lunch and when I came back after they were to be open they still weren't there and there were 4 people waiting outside.  Then a day later all of a sudden the loan was in my account.  Something isn't right.  This was I believe started on 10/1/22 , stopped twice at the office on Monday Oct 3rd but didn't stay after second attempt nor did I have contact with employees. And it appeared in my account on October 4th."

Tracy,"Easy peasy, nice people"
Lisa,"I used to say they were good, until recently. I have been trying for over 2 weeks to get a increase on a loan I had been paying in good faith even in hardships, but at one point there was a missed payment, by one day, 2 months ago due to their fault of not automatically drafting it. I paid the next day when ai realize it wasn‚Äôt drafted, but they said it takes 6 on time payments to even be considered a increase. My next one was around the corner making it my 6th, I paid it a few days earlier to see if that would help and still no answers, nor help.These guys are not the go to guys for loans anymore, I would say. They‚Äôve had enough time and a early payment should have definitely meant something, but doesn‚Äôt in their eyes. Forget Advance America at this point. There are better ones than them. Will never go to Advanced America again!"

You were paid back on the 2nd of September! Today, on September the 12th, I was finally able to get my new loan into the bank!  This is because I didn't ""ride the website"" with my normal immediate debit card  which allows me to payback my loan and immediately reapply the same day!  It was a nightmare!  Thankfully, my family covered the $255.00, or I would have had checks bouncing all over town!  I was NOT at all a happy camper, and I have been dealing with you for literally YEARS!  You took my money out YOUR WAY and made it impossible for me to immediately reapply the same day!"

CATHERINE TANNER,"Ive used this place before with less trouble, but the 3 stars is that i know this spot is better than this one rep‚Äôs attitude, so im judging as a whole, not an instance.Walking in today, i asked for the payday loan, and thru the whole process, which isnt very long thankfully, the rep was dry, stale,& less than enthusiastic to be working there. She seemed to be unable to get me out of there quick enough, clearly unattached from the fact that customers, as myself, are the reason she gets paid. We are her paycheck. As stated, the past experiences were better, so this rating is overall, but be ready to possibly deal with bad attitudes the whole process thru. Better luck to you!"

Vickie  Schexnayder,"I am a returning customer.  I recently paid off my loan.  I decided that I needed another one, so I came to Advance America first because I had a good experience with my previous loan.  I anticipated this being a quick and easy process, but that was not the case, as it turned out. When I first submitted my new application (nothing had changed), I was initially offered $1500.  As it turned out, I only needed about $900 but it was good to be offered more than I needed.  As I went through the process, and came to the bank verification, the system never could connect with my bank, so I decided to follow the alternate route of sending in my check stub (pay advice).  I sent it in as directed, and suddenly I was only offered $150.  This was very frustrating and I could find no reason for the dramatic decrease in my offer.  Even after calling customer service, they just said there was nothing they could do about the amount offered, and they refused to look any further into the matter.  I was quite disappointed in customer service.  I still do not understand why the offer was so low, but I was in a bind, so I went ahead and accepted the offer of $150.  Can you explain why all of this happened?I would love to revive my confidence in using this company in the future."

On the website's FAQ'S page, it was noted that I had to notify an associate at the company's telephone number. I did that last night, but I was told they were unable to establish a firm ""pay day"" for repayment.

She was thoughtful in saving me a trip to the bank letting me know I can use another card to make a payment on line. I had questions about the account in detail because I'm fairly new with the line of credit. Janee explained everything thoroughly and made it easy to comprehend. She has a great tone in her voice and she speaks clearly and distinctly and doesn't rush anything. I felt very relaxed and confident when speaking with Janee. So thank you so much for your wonderful employee, Janee!"

They are the worst company I‚Äôve ever dealt with! Will be glad with this is over with and I do not recommend them!

I don't want no email sent to me talking about my due date is the 1st and the money will be deducted on the 2nd.

Elihu,"Advance America is the best payday loan company I‚Äôve ever used. Flexible, great customer service, and literal INSANT deposit. I know I can always count on them in tough times."
Sandra,This is my first experience with advance america. I feel very comfortable with the way they conduct their business. But I had to let my loan go void this time because the bank that would pay the loan is not the account that receives my direct deposit and it takes several days to transfer money to that account. It would help if I could pay my loan by debit card from the account that receives the direct deposit.

Alice Little,"I have used advance america for a few years now off and on. I really appreciate that the entire process can be handled online. From application to approval to payments. Anytime I‚Äôve been unable to make a full payment or a payment at all, all I need to do is call and the customer service agents are so friendly and helpful with a payment arrangement. The negative reviews I see are from people who don‚Äôt really understand how companies like advance america work. They allow people with bad or no credit access to EMERGENCY funds (this is not to be used for bar money or clothes shopping) but you are going to pay a huge fee for their risk. Understanding that up front will make for a really positive experience."
Koffi,Quick easy and great payment plan

Kenneth,"Awesome Company To Do Business With . I have been dealing with this company for 13 years, Hawthorne Location was well as the Covina Location . both Locations are great"
Tametria,"I initially took out a payday loan with this company, which I successfully paid on time. Then the clerk had presented me with a line of credit, which she I could barely hear her, and she kind of sped through the loan. They do all agreements online, which I signed on this tiny device. I went online to check the account which I thought the interest rate was reasonable. I though this was cool and had planned on paying off the loan in two installments. I didn't realize they were charging me an exorbitant interest rate, and the loan amassed $375.45 in interest charges in the first month. Initially, only $25 was shown to have been applied to the principal. I missed the first payment, then I paid towards the second payment. They started generating random checks each month without my knowledge or permission, a few days prior to the due date to ensure that they receive their money on time. I had other bills that I needed to attend to, and their collection practices are predatory. I found out that the state I live in, they weren't supposed to have me as a customer. I'm in another state. I'm glad that I will no longer be using them as a lender, nor will I recommend them to anyone else. When they took my loan into default, I was under the impression that they were to negotiate with me on making a payment arrangement. The loan went into default after one month of being late. If I could give them zero stars, I would. According to the CFPB this type of behavior from a predatory lending institution is not uncommon. Once, I've made arrangements to take care of this bill, I will never do business with this company ever again."

Angela,"The manager was persistent is counting my advance back to me out loud with other customers waiting near me. I asked him 2x if he, could place the money on the counter slowly as I count it with him, it‚Äôs not a safe neighborhood and he refused. I told him, ‚ÄúYes; you can. Banks, cashiers do it all the time. The cameras can see the both of our mouths are moving counting the money. He just refused‚Äù. This experience made me feel nervous, unsafe and disregarded of my concerns expressed. He did not display good customer service. I felt setup to be a possible victim once I stepped out the door. (Elcamino Truxel)Truly disappointed."

Anonymous ,Bad place to get a loan. I took a loan out cause I needed to pay something Monday. I got approved rather quickly and easily but then I went to pick up my loan and they had no money. I called the next nearest branch to check if they had money so I can pick up my loan and they refused to tell me. So I drove another 16minutes only to find out they had no money either. I was told I had to cancel my current loan so I could reapply and be able to do online deposit. Problem was that now the money was going to be available Tuesday instead of Monday when I needed it. If taking out a loan as an emergency please do not consider Advance America. They are slow at giving you your money.

Paying by credit card is a more efficient way for a customer to make payments online and on time without delays! The most important aspect of using your loans is not only to access funds for essential purchases, it's most important to reestablish good standing credit status while maintaining a consistent ability to make payments on time would you agree?"

Dorothy,"Your local MERRITT Island office and the woman named Sandy (Sandra)  (sorry I can‚Äôt remember her last name) has saved me every month for over a year now. I just can‚Äôt get caught up living in SS ck of $925 a month. No hassle ever. She is efficient, professional and engaging. Never makes me feel like AA is doing me a big favor, even though they are. Don‚Äôt know what I would have done without being able to get these advances before I received my SS ck. I am very grateful to AA and especially to Sandy (Sandra) for her help and her cheerful attitude. I always feel better when I leave, not just because I secured the money, but because Sandra makes me feel good about myself. Wish I could remember her last name, but AA is exceptionally blessed to have her on their team."

George,"You suck majorlyü§Æ! I applied for $200 on August 8, 2022. My daughter also applied and gave a referral app to use for mine. I then submitted my documents into the portal on August 8, 2022. I received a notification that said I would receive my money. When the money didn't arrive, I called customer care and they said I would receive the money into my checking account on August 9, 2022. Instead, I never received my money. My daughter received her money on August 10 without her referral incentive. I called again to customer care and was placed on a 29 minute hold before I hung up. They keep saying that the money was sent. However whenever I checked my account, the $200 deposit was not there. Then, Advance America continues to send me ways to pay back the money! That's not going to happen because I never received the money. Called them several times and I still don't have the money. At least give my daughter her $20 that you SAID you would for her referral (me).This company has continued to tell me that they're so sorry about that! I forgive you but I'm not dealing with you anymore! Wish you the best! Deuces!"
Paulette,"This place is absolutely the easiest and fastest way to  get a loan even if your credit isn't that great.

Trivina,"I have been a customer for 5 yes or more and never had a problem until recently. I always get my check on the 3rd of every month. Last month my payment was due the 2nd. Because I didn't call to change it to the 3rd they went ahead and took it from my account on the 3rd. I always always pay it with my debit card over the phone. If they had called me to remind me of my payment that would of never happened, which by the way they used to do. So because I forgot to call I had to wait till the 5th to get my money again which was quite an inconvenience. I was not a happy camper especially when ever that happened before the girls in the office knew that I would be in to pay the 3rd and the would go ahead and change the date if it failed on the day before."

Eric L,"Your drafting on the night of the 1st in some cases each month when my check isn't deposited unit the night of the 2nd when the 3rd falls on a weekday. This has caused a $16.00 overdraft fee to be charged in a couple of cases. I understand that happening when the 3rd falls on a Sat or Sun, however, when the 3rd falls on a weekday drafting on the morning of the 2nd  creates an overdraft in some cases. This should be reviewed."

The website has the wrong information for instant my NAME!!! And I was not able to set up the payment the way I always do!!!! And your interest is WAY TO HIGH. Rhe email I got recently about being so loyal I qualify for the lower interest is a lie. Its highway robbery. You should be ashamed."

Gemetrish,The agent was very helpful with explaining the documents needed
Bless,I have had nothing but a good experience with Advance America. Except I have found paying the loan off is not as important as paying the monthly amount of payments. When someone gets a loan pays it off then tries to get another so the person can pay off other debts and they only give you 250 dollars less then the loan before then it keeps you from taking care of the debts that you are trying to get rid of. Buy the debts are my fault. But. All in all this loan service is pretty fantastic. Good people trying to help. Thank you for what you have done to help me climb out of a terrible situation.
Willie,My experience has been good. I think you should be more upfront on the process of turning the payday loan into a loan with payments. Instead after so many payday loans you get something on the last page that mentions an easy payment option. If your doing a loan on line it's easy to over look.
Patti,"They are the greatest,  Very friendly and knowledgeable of their jobs."
Don Dooley,Tamera was very nice and helpful. Great atmosphere!
Wendell R. Swaithes Jr,Very good experience at your store
Charles Johnson,"I went in person to get a loan and the representative at the desk,named Arlene Jerry, was absolutely amazing! Customer service skills off the charts I was thoroughly impressed with her skills and abundance of positive energy that I wanted to work there! First impressions are very important and the experience she gave me got you guys a customer for life. Definitely appreciate the loan but I'm still in awe over her professionalism, patient, skill level and just such an upbeat attitude, and that's coming from someone who's worked in customer service while customer facing for a few years and she did waaaay better than me! Although I've made this whole review about the representative I just feel it's super important to have reps customer facing like that because that positive energy will bring in more business and I can honestly say I'll be returning because of the customer service I received was so amazing! And even though I can repay the loan and apply again online I would go to the building to apply just to have another chat with Miss. Jerry! Thanks for the loan and the positive experience!"

THE OFFICE IS IMMACULATE AND I DIDN'T HAVE TO WAIT. IF YOU NEED EMERGENCY CASH, LOOK NO MORE!

Jeffrey,Have been a customer over a year and been using the online portal for about 8 months. Recently had major problems with the website. A glitch in your system cause my account to be drafted for payment by ACH debit and the payment didn't clear until 6 days later. I always used my debit card and didn't authorize an ACH. Needless to say I could not reborrow until it cleared so I got behind on my bills.it cleared my bank account on the day it should have the 1st day I called customer service to get help fixing the problem and the lady was very rude to me literally called me a liar!! So I'll be moving my loan elsewhere very soon the problem is still not fixed!! Even went to the local store and same thing happened very rude with no help. Ive paid over a thousand dollars on this loan in interest!!

Audrey,"Advance America truly came through. Like many working parents looking for a better paying job, bills still need to be paid in the meantime. I had unexpected expenses, and no means for groceries, and other household necessities. I applied on a whim, was approved the next day, and got my money deposited on Monday."
Tina,The employees at the Hialeah Gardens office are awesome always happy customer come in and they‚Äôre always helpful explaining how to do the application they are asset to your company Thank you Maria Dominguez
Salvatore,"Fast, Quick, and Easy.  Always there with the extra to make ends meet."
Irene,"I received superb, professional customer service from the staff at Advance. However, the cost of repayment was far more money than I can afford. It was necessary for me to rescind the loan within the 3 business days provided by law, and made possible by a dear friend. It left me wondering --what has all this ""payday lnder reform"" accomplished?  Perhaps the interest rates are lower cumulatively. but the payments per 500$ loan have more than doubled which is prohibitive for people like myself on fixed income. Micro-loans are a needed and necessary part of a sane society that acknowledges the terrible wealth gap. But whoever pushed for middle class laws affecting the poor left common sense and affordability of repayment completely out of the equation. ADVANCE should be proud of the professionalism of their employees--but however the only loans proffered to me by computer algoritms did not adjust  to lower monthly rrepayment, becasue when the amount borrowed was decreased, the payback term of payment also decreased..VOILA! virtually the same cost to repay a smaller loan rather than longer time to repay resulting in smaller monthly repayment  increments Not user friendly , Advance.  You can do better."
John,"KUDO'S  -""praise and honor received for an achievement.""I rarely write reviews but I think this company deserves the highest KUDO'S that can be offered in today's business world. The staff (Pat and Tera), both approach each customer straight from their hearts. They want you to have your loan as bad as you do. I haven't met the company execs, but I've found that this type of attitude flows from the top down.  I hope you can keep your generous approach to helping people. Particularly in these stressful times where folks are trying to keep their body, soul, and family together."

Mary,I just love this company.  I started out using the Dunnellon branch.   The staff there is very friendly and knowledgeable.   Then they showed me how I can apply online so I  don't have to come down to the store.  Here's another reason why I love AA.  If you go to Amscott... you must give them a check. which means you have to find a branch  near you.   And when you only get paid monthly they onlyallow 2 weeks to be paid back. No working with senior peeps.     Thanks AA for helping when I need it.  Cindy T

George,"The folks I've dealt with are all nice pleasant folks. I came to Advance America to work on buildin' my credit history, explainin' my situation, how I had no credit history and needed to find a way to qualify for a small loan. I explained to your associate I did not own a vehicle or house and had no title for a title loan. They explained to me if I were to successfully complete 4 payday loans I could apply for a small(no title)personal loan upon completion of my 4th payday loan I asked 'bout applin' for a small personal loan and was told Advance America does not grant such loans in the state of Indiana that it had to be a title loan. I spoke extensively to your associate before my first loan and durin' the course of my 4 payday loans and not once was I told your company only does title loans in Indiana. This was a bit disappointin' to me.Jefferson T. Jones"

I tried from Thursday to Monday to cash that check, Kroger, Walmart, Meijer, my bank... No one would cash that check. Soo called, they said a place downtown (20mi) would cash it for sure but I had to get there while the store I got the check from was open so it could be verified. So, grandkids in tow, I schlepp downtown where they were more than happy to can my check, for a paltry fee of $35.00!!!!!  To cash a 700 check that they just verified.

JAMES,If you‚Äôre in a crunch and need some cash ASAP to get by for a week or to this place is great! The finance charge isn‚Äôt over the top compared to most companies. I‚Äôve seen some go up to 800% finance charge and that‚Äôs utterly insane! Advance is about $15 per $100 borrowed which is fair imho.
Jose,These guys have saved me more than once! They‚Äôre always there when I need help and it‚Äôs affordable. I probably could get a small personal loan for the bank now but I‚Äôll stick with these guys because they were there then I needed them!

Wayne,Your internet app sucks. You ask if your info has changed and we answer NO CHANGES. Then you have to jump through loops to prove that you are the person that has provided you my personal info. Then once it proven then you have to continue providing info. It just isn‚Äôt worth the hassle because most of the time you have to go into a store to sign the paperwork or get the money. Since you‚Äôve closed our store in Farmerville LA I have to go 45 miles to get to one of your opened establishments  you finally put the $$$ in my acct this time but just not worth the hassle.

Lana,"Your Three Rivers, Mi store was its usual self; friendly people and good service, always a pleasure. Your store on S. Westnedge Ave in Kalamazoo was another story. When I got there it was apparently closed for lunch with the sign indicating that it would not reopen for over an hour. Some people had been waiting for a half hour when I got there. When a worker returned I had been there for a half hour, others over an hour. What really cheesed everyone off was the fact that they didn‚Äôt reopen for another 10 minutes or so and apparently there had been someone inside all along and she breezily told us it would be about 15 more minutes as she apparently was just going to lunch. By the time the young lady finally reopened, there were about 8 of us waiting outside in the heat, one lady almost passed out. I‚Äôve never seen crap like this in one of your stores before and if I experience anything like it again I‚Äôm taking my business elsewhere. I don‚Äôt know what the problem is with keeping help, but if you‚Äôre going to train somebody after a holiday weekend, especially when most people couldn‚Äôt re-borrow because of Michigan law and had to wait until the weekend was over, you should at least take that into consideration and staff accordingly. Though I must say my friends in Three Rivers had no problem and gave their usual prompt and friendly service."
Henry Willians,It was smooth went great. I enjoy doing business with Advance America.

I love that Advance is keeping up with the electronic technologies of 2022 except this review section would not allow me to pick a specific office/store because the box for the area code would not search and was forcing me to scroll through all Advance America stores.  So I was forced to click no specific location in or to submit this review."

Jewels,I had an bad experience someone was acting like they worked for the company sent me an approval letter telling me I was approved for a loan but then asks for too much information as far as my bank login information which I find very weird because that has never been asked before normally they would call my bank for verification but he wanted all of my information and he stated I would get funded $657 that I would have to go into a store active a prepaid debit card and make a payment to them then I would get my loan I said that‚Äôs weird to me because what company asks for money up front so than he does my bank verification but some how I found out he was disputing transactions on my account and making it seem like it was from their company but it was actually  my bank crediting my account for transactions he disputed. He was texting me which I thought was weird and kept blowing up my phone for me to send money back and he was trying to rush me so I knew it was a red flag and changed all of my information because I felt he was a scammer his name is Brandon Day please be aware and please be careful he threaten to have my account negative if I didn‚Äôt send the money that actually belongs to me to him and legal action against me which I am not worried about because he‚Äôs a fraud and scammer

DENISE,"All office staff at the Port Charlotte location have always been very nice, pleasant, courteous, helpful, and always very professional.It seems I am getting more and more requests for reviews from a variety of sources. A bit time-consuming!I'm doing this out of courtesy and appreciation to the ladies at the Port Charlotte location. Any future reviews requested will require either a discounted interest rate or payment for my time and efforts.As you probably know, there are many companies that do actually provide compensation or some sort of perks.I have Not been offered any incentive or payment for this review, but I would sure appreciate it! And with the interest rates you charge, I'm sure you can easily afford to do something!Barry Rosenberg,  941-855-0105"

Phyllis,"This location was great. No complaints. I left the negative review about the Hammond location and the result was the manager of the Hammond location  called to offer some kind of compensation yet the whole time I had to defend my review to her. I complained again and still haven't heard anything from anyone about the way I was treated. Most unprofessional service I've ever received. This experience was so bad that I refuse to go to that location which was a half mile from my house and traveled 15 miles to get good service.  I contacted the BBB and left a review on Google  about this terrible experience.  I was contacted by the ""Pissed Consumer"" website about making a video about my treatment and how you guys never responded to this lady's terrible attitude about a complaint about a computer problem. Since I get no satisfaction from your management team,  I'll let it be known that you don't care about customers and to seek loans elsewhere."

Patricia,"THE WHOLE PROCESS WAS A NIGHTMARE.    First I went on line to get loan, then decided I would go pick it up myself. I was told that It would be ready to pick up in 3 business days. That was too long. I tried for some time to cancel the unfinished online loan process, but could not find a way to do it. Then I drove to Advance America on West El Camino, and was told they could not give me a payday loan because I already had a loan  ""IN PROCESS"" and I would have to drive home and finish it.    So I did, but was too upset to safely drive back to West El Camino, which is quite a distance away. So I went the next day and it was closed in the middle of the day. So then I drove back today and they said my loan went thru, but they didn't have any cash. . I asked it they could just deposit it in my bank account, but was told that he couldn't do that unless I  called the number he gave me and cancelled the loan. I tried to do that outside in the parking lot, but the Advance America lady on the line told me that "" YES, THEY COULD CANCEL THE LOAN IN PERSON AT EL CAMINO"", so I went back in. They couldn't, or maybe they just didn't know how.  So I ended up driving up and down Stockton Blvd for 45 minutes to find the other store in the heat. I had to call 3 times for direction, but at least they had the cash.    HOW IN THE H--- CAN A PAYDAY ADVANCE PLACE (West El Camino) RUN OUT OF CASH????? IT WAS STILL MORNING! And NO, they could not just transfer the loan to my bank. You folks must be really hard up for capable workers.This is way too much trouble to do business with Advance America. Poor management all around."

Tamecka,I am upset at what happened to me a few days ago. I did my installment loan via phone on the website. I only wanted $350  I got approved for $730 but that was too much. I had a customer service rep on the phone and she couldn't fix it. The interest on $730 will be outrageous. She told me I had to wait 48 hours to return the money. So now I have to drive 20 miles to try to fix this. There should be a way to cancel a loan and reapply. Where if I did that I had to wait 7 to 14 days. That just doesn't seem right. So Monday I am driving down there.

I don't get paid until Friday,  yet my funds were taken out on a Thursday two separate times - I was told this was because I borrowed on my pay day. Which resulted in overdrawn Bank account that included overdraft fees. I also had to choose a pay day a week prior to my actual pay day because the option wasn't available.  This has been an expensive and stressful experience."

Worst experience EVER with a pay loan. I doubt ill use advance america again. This was a horrible experience. If i could rate less stars i would. Its an online loan..

What I got was ignored for three days after I was told I would have an answer by end of business hours. I took my business to Advance America. From the time I walked in, I was treated like a friend and an asset. Ms. Turneas went above and beyond to get me what I needed. In an hour I had the money I needed AND felt like a valued customer, instead of a burden like at the ‚Äúbig bank.‚Äù I will be back should the situation arise and I have told everyone I know if they have money troubles to go to Advance America and see Ms. Turneas!"

Frankie Medina,"6-1-22The Rep I was talking to said I was approved for a loan and would be wire transferred today, also was told 100% guaranteed, no problem on the same day, gave me his word, and even promised me, NOTHING!!! üòíI told him it was an emergency situation and needed ASAP. Waited all day, every time I called I was told not to worry I would get it today. He had my hopes up and because of my situation, I told him if he made me very happy, I could make my husband very happy, NOTHING!!! I was so disappointed üò¢ and in turned it made my husband mad because he also was expecting me to send the money to him. I really thought the Rep was really going to make it a great day.  I was really, really so disappointed and üòîüòíüò¢üò¢ The only way to make this right, is for the rep I was talking to wire transfer to me today ASAP, 6-2-22. But I know that will not happen üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢"

What he was saying didn‚Äôt even answer my question. Once I told him he was being rude and had poor customer service he improved slightly. I will not deal with Advance America again based on this.

KFM,"Your customers come to you primarily because they need money to survive and because banks wont lend them money. It is very un likely that entrepreneurs get loans from you. Given that the excessively high APR, and fees don't help them. Typically, payday loan companies don't report ontime payments to the credit bureaus but they do report delinquencies to the credit bureaus. How fair is that?The terms and conditions are carefully designed to make it very difficult to make the required payments on time for customers who are already struggling to survive. There needs to be a balance between your company making a profit and really helping those in need. Companies such as your are service companies, aren't they?Every payday loan probably conducts business similar to you but it doesn't necessarily justify these business practices."

I Have to say I never thought my review would be noticed but I've been proved wrong I was contacted by Christy O'Neal from the Tulsa Oklahoma office and she was sorry to hear my bad review and explained to why I couldn't pay off My loan early and it was due to me using a debit card and that they had been getting frauded by debit  cards it turns out I could have paid off the loan in person with a check , cashier's check or money order but I was doing it over the phone and wasn't told why I couldn't pay it off early. so just want to say Thank You to Christy O'Neal for contacting me and making it right . so If you need a loan I recommend advance America  they'll do you right"

I would give THEM 5 stars!"
Kimberly G,"I was in need of a quick, last minute loan. Advance America made that happen! Although the starting loan amount was less than I needed, it still helped. Their interest rates are reasonable compared to others. Eventually, you may be eligible for higher loan amounts, lower interest. I've went through AA for a few loans, each time has been quick and convenient. You can also set up a loan online too, which I prefer. I trust AA and highly recommend!"
Olivia,"Always very friendly and helpful. Never seen anyone in a bad mood. The manager, I think, is always training and helping the new employees and taking care of the customers all at that same time. I saw her stand between 2 trainees, and communicate with customer at window and say hi and greet other customers as they entered..friendly, fun and professional. Also saw her handle a problem customer, who had been told numerous times that he needed a bank statement showing a positive balance, not a letter that he brought from the bank. From what I saw, she has told this man over and over again like 5 times, different days, and he just don't get it. He was waiting in lobby for his turn, and she asked him if he had his bank statement, no but I got this letter,  she said I'm sorry sir, but we have been through this many times, which then she was backed up by another saying, sir we have told you everytime you come in here, we cannot use that paper and you have been told what we need. We are sorry but we cannot help you again today"

My heart was heavy and broken. I was applying in hopes to put a down payment on another puppy. The care, concern and genuine care TyKeia gave me was above and beyond her duties. I am 69 yrs old and I never had a daughter, but I felt like I did that day. I didn't know her before and I have not spoken to her since, but I just had to tell you how valuable of an employee and human being she is. I'm sure that you get a lot of negative reviews as people are just on edge these days and I understand that as well. I pray that some people can remember the nice things that people do. The manager and the other employee was kind and friendly with everyone who walked through the door. I dealt directly with TyKeia, and after leaving her, I had renewed faith. Thank You for having a person like that in your company. You were very smart to hire her. God Bless You and thank you for your time."

Christopher Smallwood,F.E.I. for everyone's information: PDL (payday loans) are soft inquiries and WILL NOT reflect on your credit report. IL (installment loans) are hard inquiries and WILL reflect on your credit report.
Renee Glenn,The manager of the location has a very bad attitude! The day I walking in to get loan she was sitting outside on the phone and when I walked I said are you open and she said what you need?? I was like damn I don't want to go in there but I proceeded because I needed the cash until that Monday! I sent my husband in to pay the 500.00 back because via my contract it stated that I could pay back loan without the fee and she wanted to charge him the full 587.50 which my husband called me and told him that what my contract says and i told him to her to call somebody! The manager of this location is simply unprofessional and she is not empathic at all. I can honestly see why the location is closing because I promise you I am not the only feels this way!
Ann,Jewell assisted me Saturday and was very quick and nice. I appreciate how I am always able to get out of whatever I‚Äôm going through by using you guys. Great place as customer service.
judy campbell,The clerks were amazing.  Very professional and attentive.
Sunshine,I don't like the amount of my
Tammie,"Pre-pandemic, I used a competitor when I ran into emergency issues. This year I found myself in need of a loan, and applied for a loan not with my former cash advance place, but with Advance America. I was shocked when they only offered me $400 for an installment loan (I make very good money, have a fair credit score, own my own house, etc...). But I needed it that day so I got it. I will be paying the balance off this Friday when I get paid in lieu of the installment process....and next time I'll not use Advance America. Heck, even a payday loan would have netted me $500."
TERRY Watson Sr,"This was easily the best transaction. Super easy, super simple and had the money in my account the same day. No hassle, no confusion, no uploading documents. Website was easy to maneuver and easy application process!"
FRANCES,"The process was great!  Simple and quick. Problem came when I chose to pickup cash Friday afternoon at a local office and they only had $300 cash in when I requested $1270.  I ended up having to take a check, which when deposited held the check until Monday, getting the cash I needed for the weekend didn‚Äôt help!  Ended up having to borrow more elsewhere, which cost me.   If your going to be a big loaner, you have to have cash on hand!!  Afraid I won‚Äôt use this company if you don‚Äôt provide your offices with sufficient amounts of money.  I think I should get my finance charges waived since I had to borrow somewhere else also!   On the positive, the young lady at the office was very pleasant and try different options to try to help.  She called your help center, and they tried to have me pickup cash hundreds of miles away.  Help center was no help for the young lady."
Alberto,"Friendly service, that is rare now."

CPR,"I am not happy with my recent experience. They have never sent my check to the bank. They know if I can't make it on my due date they know I will be in the next morning. Sometimes my doctor's appointments fall on my due date and I have to wait until the next morning to pay my check. They automatically know this. But since you made changes to how they are suppose to process checks it caused me a bunch of grief. It caused me several trips to my bank and gas that no one can hardly afford today. I am not pleased with your company at all. There are many check writing places in New Albany, Mississippi but people chose yours. But doing this type of stuff to people is a good way to run off business. Your company is the only one who has ever done this to me."

And she trains her Personnel to care for you as if you're the only customer they ever had. The only complaint I have is your online service. I was able to make a online loan twice and after that I have had difficulty. It tells me that I need to change my password which I did. Customer service assisted me. But I am still unable to do an online loan. So if you guys could work The Kinks out of that I think everything will be spectacular. I have talked to others that have had similar problems with the online loan. Your company is wonderful to us who are hard-working people and who live on fixed incomes. Thank you so much

As a customer I have a right to make a decision on wearing face mask on my own, if the manager wants to wear one, fine.

Ms lady,My loan renewal was frustrating.  After 20+ renewals I know how it works.  Some glitch in your system approved me but wouldn't let me sign the documents.  The signature page would appear but no boxes to check to OK electronic signature.  After at least 20 tries it finally let me sign.  You can do better.

LaQuiesha,Can pay bill but can't apply for loan on my phone.
Thomas,"The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars are the crazy high interest rates. Makes it very hard to pay off an installment loan when you've paid $1400 and the balance has gone down by $200. Other than that, these loans are very easy to get and the funding is instant. Also you can make a debit card payment online instead of waiting for the ACH to go through and it applies the payment immediately. If you can pay off fast and save yourself alot of the interest its a good deal but if you can only make the minimum payment you will end up paying 4 times what you borrowed."
Rebecca,They are always helpful and very friendly
Melody McConnell,I appreciate advance America for their service.. they have always been there when I needed them.

RUSSELL,"I‚Äôm satisfied with everything but one issue. Your system should alert us when we apply for a payday loan too early. Second time I‚Äôve done this as I‚Äôve had a ton on my mind and wasn‚Äôt thinking! Our disability checks were given on April 1st since the 3rd was on a Sunday. I accidentally applied for the loan on the 2nd of the month. Now I have to call and arrange for them not to debit until the 3rd. Doing that makes everything wonky since it looks as though you can‚Äôt/aren‚Äôt paying your loan! So an alert would be nice, to make us stop to realize we need to wait! Thank you!"

Mr Floyd Biggs Richard,"I‚Äôm not typically a person who writes reviews, but with the service that I received from Advance America 125 N. Gallitan Pike Madison, TN., I MUST. I walked in needing a loan urgently and not sure of what to do. It was late in the day (shortly before closing) and there was already customers ahead of me with only one representative working. While waiting, I observed the lone associate (Renee Cordova) help the customers ahead of me so patiently and thorough that I was immediately put at ease. She explained all of the loan service options available to me in a concise, detailed manner but did so, with the kindness and understanding that only a person who is genuinely interested in helping people could do. She found the right loan option for my needs, and I left with a solution. That is what Ms. Cordova is an expert at doing! Finding a financial solution for her customers in their time of need! She will patiently explore all of the options that she has, and if she can get you approved, SHE WILL!! Do Not Hesitate to take your business to this location! You will get Expert Customer Service!

In January of 22' , I arrived at the 5143 Salem Ave. location-located in Trotwood, OH 45426. I advised her of my financial decrepancies & if there was any way she can assist. RoyAnn went above & beyond to resolve my issue. The patience & knowledge she exhibited was noteworthy! It's outstanding employees such as herself, that make a customer eager to refer someone to your place of business. Rare to find employees passionate about their work duties & interactions with the public. She deserves a ""raise"" & a ""praise"" of ""job well done"". Truly GOD sent! Keep up the good work."

They offered to hold my loan payment until the following day without hesitation. I have never defaulted on any payment due since using Advance America and found their willingness to help me out absolutely AWESOME.  However, I did find my car keys before the end of business on April 4th and arrived to the location in the afternoon to may off my loan.KUDOS to all the wonderful workers at the Vallejo, CA location.  They are, in my opinion, the best!!  Thanks again for your patience and understanding.. Always, Monica D. Miller"

Diana,"I hadn't been in the office for a while, but needed a loan for some upcoming event. It was a pleasure to see the worker who has been there for me before. She's extremely pleasant. I usually ask her if she's been vaccinated yet. Prior to this time, she's reported no. I didn't ask her this time, because I've come to the conclusion that if she isn't vaccinated by now, nothing I could say (or nag about) would change that. I was just glad there was a see-through divider and I could keep my mask on without being harassed. I do wish Advance America would require vaccination of its employees, but that's life in America; it seems, that my understanding of common sense is not the understanding of the common sense of others. C'est la vie dans Les Etats-Unis, I guess. Be well and prosper! You guys come in handy in a pinch. And pleasantness counts for so much in this world :)"

There is not an easy way to change the date."

Jimmy. Green,The only thing that I do not like about them is that I did not have a bank in town and they approved me for a loan so they told me that I would have to pay the charges for western Union and then they turned around and told me to get a Google play card at a Walmart so then I would be receiving my loan from WU ( was my assuming) but then after I talked to them they told me that I did not make my insurance so I had to pay another 100.00 to get my loan so are they scamming me or what!!

David,"The online application for payday advance did not work out at all. I submitted all documents as requested and then nothing. No response, just that is was pending. That was over 18 hours, when advertised as approval in minutes. I had to go to the physical location where the lady had some difficulty since I had an open application but it seemed to be lost in the universe‚Ä¶ It took a long time but she finally processed it and I was approved for $250. Deposited immediately into my checking account. I‚Äôm glad I got it but the point of applying online was the urgent need, and then it turned into a very time consuming situation. Experience in store was great, not the lady‚Äôs fault the online app caused her to have to take more time than usual. Skip online if it‚Äôs a true emergency. Unreliable."

Mary,"The online process was super easy but when I went to pick up the money I drove to 3 different locations, the first one was no longer there, the second one was closed until 3pm (online stated they were open 10am-6pm and I was there around 1:30pm) so I drove to the third location and the same thing, closed until 3pm but again online stated their hours were from 10am-6pm. I ended up not picking up the money and instead ended up asking a family member for money because I had to work and used what little gas I had driving to these three locations, these hours should be reflected online so this doesn't happen to others, I understand its hard finding employees and people to work but this was definitely not an ideal situation."

I just recently redid my payday loan, but instead of getting a nice customer service person to help me with the date which is only 6 days away, I got a person who had no idea and informed me that that simply could not be done. Which I know is not true.  I am planning on paying off what I owe AA and not doing any more business with your company.  I have truly never been more insulted in my life."

Gerald,"On Friday 3/25 I asked the store attendant (Dick Pond Rd, Myrtle Beach SC) if I take out a PayDay loan today, am I able to come in and 1) PAY that off on MONDAY and then 2) apply and get a Line of Credit loan that same day.  She said YES but gave me the customer service number to call in my payment.  Well today is MONDAY and no customer service rep can take my payment (not in system) and the local branch has no way to do it either (her systems are ONLY for lines of credit). I applied for the Line Of Credit which is $1000 BUT you can‚Äôt give me ANYTHING of that until my PayDay loan is paid.  I am going out of state on Wed and needed more funds before I left.  The online chat agent said it takes 4 calendar days before PayDay shows up for me to pay off.  Neither the local Myrtle each agent nor 2 at your customer service stations knew that either."

Charles Robertson,I was 1 day late paying on a loan and was called and told that my check was process it bounced. First of all I was stressing out at work after the call cause I was not able to check with my bank. Then when I got off work I went straight to the bank withdrew the money and went straight to AA to pay the loan but asked the teller if my check was rejected they stated it never was processed. The worker named Amber lied to me twice first on the call then when I went into AA. Very disappointed I‚Äôve never had an issue before.

Stuart  Witt,"I applied online and when I received an email about needing more info like my selfie ID, I sent that in. I kept receiving emails that I needed another selfie ID, I called several times and kept being told I needed something else, but the only email I received said selfie ID, then when I would login, it would have me verify by banking info, which I had done several times. The website is not very user friendly and makes it hard to deal with. It was very frustrating to go through that. The website/email system needs to change to be less confusing and state what is needed and allows us to only enter the information that is needed. I had to make several phone calls. I chose to apply online so I didn‚Äôt have to talk to anyone."
Jan,Always really friendly and helpful
Michelle,The girls who worked with me were very courteous and helpful. I would recommend Advance America over any quick loan place.

At this point, she has not only convinced us to switch our business from Amscot, to Cash Advance America permanently. She then advised my family to go from payday loans to installment loans which have been of great help to us and our budget. Any payment plan arrangements we have available she communicates above and beyond, ensuring our continued business. She also clearly communicates our deadlines so we know exactly the terms and conditions of our loans, which we appreciate. Her professionalism is the reason we do business with Cash Advance America. When Daly left to a new store, we decided to do business at her new location. She represents the height of service excellence for this or for any company that my family has ever done business with.

Cheryl,"I should have done this review a week ago, but I am technically challenged and didn't know how. My review is regarding the store in Steubenville, Oh. On March 1st I needed money to take my fur child to the Vet for all of his shots and meds. Prior to my visit, I called the day before to see if I would qualify because I was still paying the $500 loan off. The rep was clearly busy, as evident by the conversation heard as I talked to her. She apologized telling me she would call me back. She did, at which time the policy regarding loans was explained professionally with the kindness I wish all CSRs had. I met her the next day, paid the balance of the open loan and was approved for another. Your company helped once more. I am most thankful, as is the dog, the Vet, all pet lovers! who do what we can to ensure the health of our pets. By the way, she was better in person than on the phone. GREAT EXPERIENCE!"

Barbara P,"Love love LOVE Miss Heather at West Des Moines location!  Consistently professional, remarkable recall & welcoming. Thank uWish your website was able to keep better track of my pay dates - which are the same two days each month.  It would prevent me from having to call your WDSM location every time to change the date after I‚Äôve created the loan.  I would not be so dependent on the website if it weren‚Äôt for so many of your locations closer to me closing.  I understand the practicality of due to Covid, staffing, effects is Stimulus payments that surely affected your industry.  Otherwise, the website is pretty user friendly."

While I‚Äôve always thought she was very methodical, I have learned that your associates are in fact human beings like the rest of us.  It‚Äôs refreshing to know that your people have lives, gardens, and concerns like everyone else.  Down here in LA (lower Alabama) we tend to share personal things and opinions amidst business conversations.  Sometimes a simple inquiry such as ‚ÄúHow were your days off?‚Äù can break the ice.  People here want to feel comfortable when doing business and your associates are good at making me feel comfortable regardless of my situation."

Carlos Martinez,"Manager Angela is a very professional, kind , helpful and friendly individual at the location I frequent here in Rock Hill South Carolina and unfortunately, I & my hubby have to rate 1‚≠êÔ∏è Due to the awfully unprofessional treatment we received when first we entered Advance America . If We could rate less than zero we would !! AA also falsely advertises some things that are acceptable when first an account is opened with them !!! I & my hubby are also EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE when the manager mentioned above isn‚Äôt present at AA to serve us & AWKWARD !! We have left when manager wasn‚Äôt available & went back when she was available so we don‚Äôt have to feel so uncomfortable‚Ä¶. Maybe later our review can be updated , especially since they have new services available online for customers. right now , not very pleased with the treatment we‚Äôve received nor the false advertising!                                  Daryl & Barbara D."
Tracey,"Advance america has always been fair to me, and I appreciate the fast response."
Unknown,"I was dealing with the financial disaster of Identity theft. My own financial institutions wouldn‚Äôt help me to bridge the gap while trying to keep my head above water. I‚Äôve been with them same bank and local branch for 18 years!!! Well, one call to the Advance America‚Äôs Calcutta office, and off I went. They actually listened to me, saw that there‚Äôs more to me than my now horrific credit score. They were professional, empathetic, and extremely patient with me. I‚Äôve never had to obtain a loan like this before, and had numerous questions.  I gave her all of my documentation and all we could do is hope for the best during the ‚Äúsoft‚Äù inquiry. I Was Approved!! I was then briefly in tears. :) I can‚Äôt thank them enough! The stress that was relieved is immeasurable. If I ever find myself in a tight spot again, there‚Äôs absolutely no other business I will trust."

Anna,Advance has helped for a long always great service . My Goal is to get out of the Advance America wheel im on this year with the Goals i have set.
Celianne,Great place to get a little extra cash before payday. Also the woman who manages the location I go to is very kind and understanding we've got to know each other on a personal level I just love dealing with her. In fact after the 1st loan was paid back ive continued to get payday loans there and didn't need to at times just to keep having conversations with the manager at the location. And she knows that life can throw curve balls at us sometimes and we may not make a payment on time but as long as you communicate with her everything is just fine. She makes a note in your file of your conversations and when you will be able to make your payment. But I've recently found out the company is closing this location and my newly acquaintance friend is going to be out of a job. But she's not worried and in fact taking time off from finding another job right away. I'll miss you buddy all the best to you I know great things will come your way!!
Lanita,"It has been awhile since I have needed some quick financial assistance.  Your office has updated with a lot of technology and a new boss lady.Well your boss is fantastic.  I'm 76 and not the best technology expert.  She helped me download my banking app, led me through all the steps to secure my loan and voila.  $500 appeared in my bank.  Fantastic service and the young lady was a technology expert on top of everything.

Customer,I‚Äôve had to resubmit paycheck stubs multiple times. I use the verification system to link to my bank. It finds my paystubs and when the screen refreshes to upload them to the site.

Errol,"I don‚Äôt know about other locations, but this Advance America has the best staff, plus it‚Äôs always super quick and easy!"
Sandra,The rep I had did not put into consideration that I have been with advanced American for years and lied to me and said that a supervisor would give me a call. I knew it was a lie cause she told me that he was in a meeting and I know she works from home I was so upset but I know that I did all the proper steps I just needed to update my bank information and my funds were sent it was frustrating cause I know she didn‚Äôt want to help me. If I were a first time customer I would have just went somewhere else but I knew either I just got a bad rep or she must be new but even new should know better. I will still do business but now I‚Äôm a little hesitant about recommending. I don‚Äôt want my recommendation to have a bad experience like that.

Constant,I was in a world of hurt. I needed some emergency funds and drove by advance America and wondered if I could get some cash quickly from them. I went inside and was helped by very kind lady and she helped me with a payday loan that was very simple except I use an internet bank (Go2Bank) which they don‚Äôt accept. So she asked me if I had any other accounts and I told her I had a chime account and it worked to get the loan!! So I got the cash I desperately needed and can pay it back on my payday for a 45 dollar fee. I was surprised it wasn‚Äôt more of a cost‚Ä¶ but as long as I pay it on time she said I would be okay. Thank you AA

She has the personal touch that many people have loss in this day and age! She has helped me with a couple situations and I have told many friends about her. Keep up the great work!
Rosa,"While the young man in the store was wonderful - helpful, polite, professional, and efficient, the fact that I had to go to the store at all was extremely inconvenient, and the two ""people"" who attempted to assist me via Chat on your online platform were useless. I had already tried everything they told me to do. I could get to the point where my password was accepted, and it said, ""Welcome, Leslie, blah, blah, blah,"" then gave instructions to enter the verification code you would be sending. I received verification codes via text and email, and each time I entered them and clicked Verify, the yellow ""Verify"" box turned pale and no further action would occur. I understand that multistep authentication is being implemented to improve security, but perhaps you shouldn't roll it out until you've worked out all the bugs. This experience was a nightmare."
Toshiba Moore,Thank you for your professionalism. I recommend this company for anyone looking to borrow many. They are fast and efficient. There is not a lot of paperwork to read and sign. This place is definitely A1.

Darlene,"Advance America continues to provide an unconventional way of getting money. Some people say payday loan companies are a rip off. Well I will say, to get fast cash when it's needed, the high APR is worth it, This company is no different from the rest of the companies, making money, Advance just deals with high risk loans more, plus I pay off early, so I don't pay all of the APR. Great service and great customer service.."
Allen,I always pay using my debit card but the last few times they turned into my bank and secured funds before I got paid grrrrr

LS,Paige V. went above and beyond to help solve a situation I was in and answered my questions thoroughly. I won‚Äôt go into details but I was pretty stressed out and her calm words and helpful tone lifted every amount of that stress off my shoulders; in short if I ever have to call anywhere for customer service and the quality wasn‚Äôt as good as Ms. Paige V. then I don‚Äôt think they would deserve a 5 star review. She deserves the best and in my opinion is one of the greatest employees in the service industry to date.

They are fast, well-mannered women, business oriented, friendly and courteous to their customers. While in this office, I‚Äôve never heard a worker disrespect a customer, not even to the rude impatient customers. This office lets you know of all the new changes, and makes sure you know how to use them. They count out your money in your hand to the dollar, unless you do direct deposit as I do and I am in and out within twenty minutes or less. I highly recommend this office."

Randy P,"update: when the regular manager is there, service is excellent, efficient, polite, timely and no problems. she is on maternity leave, and will be back probably, sometime in march. i will be glad to see her return. i am on an emergency call now. i cannot continue this conversationmy last payment was due on the 4th wednesday. on tuesday you took the payment from my account, causing me fees and lots of embarrassment. i have brought my $$ in, for several years now, on the payment date, in cash. why take the money out of my account early? what's worse, that account i use for my house payment. the problem delayed my house payment, caused a bad check entry on my statement that will never go away. also this is causing a discussion issue with my bank, as my plan was to refinance two credit cards there, and now i have a serious derogatory that is not my fault. i am NOT happy. what's even worse, the gentleman taking my on time cash payment on wednesday, thought this was funny when i came in to discuss it on thursday when i discovered the problem. today, two stars exceeds the quality of the service."

angela m sibbalucca,"We have been a customer for over 3 years now. Kat at the Lakeport branch has always been helpful and informative. She gets a 10 from us.     However, the one problem we've had was recent. January 24th 2020 we took out a $200 loan as usual, and on the 26th of January the amount of the loan and the interest, $235.12 was taken out of our account. We thought that $35.12 for a four day loan was unfair. Usually we repay the 19th and the 25th.     Other than that we love your services. The loan was made by a different worker than Kat.                         Thank you. Michaela Snider"

Jeffrey Wood,As always this place has helped me so much u can't imagine
Jean Dorce,"I was in Winnsboro, SC and found a Advance America location and decided to go in to get an advance. Since it was closer to me at the time. I was expecting the same customer service that I get from the Two Notch Road location. To my surprise, it was not at all what I am use to. To say the least the representative acted as if she didn't want to wait on me. The store had a be back at 3:00pm sign on the door and I arrived at 3:10pm the representative told. E she was still on break but would assist me. I should have left at that point, but gave it a try. The representative made it a point to me that all their customers get checks we don't keep cash. Not friendly at all. I should have known because it has been my experience that mostly all the people in the Winnsboro area are rude and unprofessional. I will Not go back to that location again. The two at the Two Notch Road location are very friendly from the time they unlock the door until they finish your transaction. Winnsboro has a bad representation for visitors and customer service. I thought the Advance America in the area would be different but not. They didn't even provide or offer water or snacks."

Also, when paying back payday advances via direct debit, the system process it and then sends a text loan paid in full but then a few minutes later another text that says ‚Äúpayment returned‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt make sense. Other than that I would recommend AA to others."

Teresa was unprofessional and I know that to be true from our exchange. Overall in-store courtesy was 360 degrees from what I experienced on-line. Thank you, you get 5 stars!!! Not to be associated with Teresa..."

After much frustration I decided to go into a store an apply & got denied again due to the system stating that I already had a loan out. I assured them that I didn't. I explained about the 3day process & the 3ladies @ the Government St branch sprung into action & help me walk out the door with the cash I needed uploaded on my debit card so that I would not have to go to the bank and deposit the money. I appreciate the time they took out to help me get to the bottom of why I was being denied.  It was the online application that was the issue... Thanks ladies, your efforts to help me will not be forgotten especially when I go to bake. Lol"

Efren Mauricio,"I was an in-person customer of Advance America a while ago, so I knew there was a 24hr wait time if you needed to renew the loan. Last week I did a loan online for the first time. The money was deducted out of my account yesterday and has cleared. Being 24 hrs later I tried to renew and was told by customer service I have to wait 3 business days. There was no mention of this that I saw online. They told me if I would have paid with my debit card prior to them taking the payment automatically then I could have renewed in 24hrs. Again, no mention of that either.  I asked if I can show them my bank statement showing that the payment cleared, they said I could but I would still have to wait 3 business days. Not very willing to assist. They have lost a customer."

She should get an employee of the year award and a nice gift card for going above the call of duty.                      Thanks Christa!"
Jonathan,"I applied Thursday early afternoon. No one reached out or asked for anything. Come the next day, I reached out and asked if there was anything else I needed to do (again, had not and still haven‚Äôt received what was needed). I was informed an ID was needed. So I put that in. Later that day around 4:45 - 5 - I logged back in and it said it was approved! Awesome! It may take a little time. Then it tells me it won‚Äôt be available until the next business day (and weekends aren‚Äôt business days). After that, the site updates to tell me due to Mondays holiday, they won‚Äôt come through that day either. So now I will (maybe) be receiving the money into my account literally three days before I‚Äôm supposed to pay it back. How is that ok? Why was I not informed BEFORE hand? The site said nothing about that until after 5 on Friday. I can‚Äôt talk to anyone about it because you guys were closed all weekend apparently. I‚Äôd already  applied and was approved so I couldn‚Äôt go somewhere else, which forced me to have to wait, in silence, to hopefully be able to call on the 18th and explain the situation. I‚Äôll be honest, I was super relieved at first when it went through, then I found out all the other information and it instantly made me feel far worse. My opportunities were taken and I feel like the company took complete advantage of me in my time of need. I‚Äôm seriously upset about this. I didn‚Äôt need the money on Tuesday, on Monday, noR Sunday. I needed it Thursday or Friday, Saturday at the latest. Not a whole week later. At this point, it‚Äôs going to cost me even more money to borrow this money, AND I still got hit with late fees. Literally, this whole process and the lack of transparency has cost me about $150 in fees, not including the fee for this. I‚Äôm in a worse spot than I was. I really do feel like this was done predatorily. I‚Äôm not the only one who experienced this, and it makes me think it was done purposefully. The lack of communication, the fact I had to reach out to find out what else was needed, the fact the site said nothing about the 17th until after the fact, etc. I‚Äôm not trying to be rude, but this has caused a lot of problems when it should have been helping to solve them."
Tawana,"My experience at the physical store location was great. The staff was helpful, and the service was fast. This is the only reason I gave 3 stars instead of 1. My experience with the online system and online application process, not so much. The online system was terrible, hard to navigate, not user friendly, and very aggravating. Not to mention the fact that after being lead to believe the loan was a done deal, there was additional verification I had to go through, which caused me to have to take more time out of my day, and undergo more stress. If I didn't need the money, I would have just given up. Website definitely needs improvement."

Shirley,"When doing an online payday loan the date populated a day before my payday. I quickly reached out to the store in town that I had usually gone to about this. I let them know and the gentlemen said that he would have to manually change the date to the next day as he was unsure why it was populating that way and that I was not the only customer that had called about this concern. Unfortunately, he did not manually change the date and the loan went through a day before my payday causing my account to go negative. I was told there was nothing that could be done but I could purchase another loan the next day to help. I have been a long time customer and there definitely could‚Äôve been something done for the gentlemen‚Äôs mistake. But there wasn‚Äôt. Starting the new year off with a negative account was not ideal."

No, it went to my other bank and I didn't know it. There is no email to verify WHERE the money is being deposited. This can lead to confusion. This is concerning ONLINE activity."

Linda,Keep up the great working helping  those people who are in the need of extra money or short on payday.
Tracy,"Bait and switch.  I had completed all of the paperwork needed to obtain a loan and then was told this location was closing so I would have to deal with either Des Moines or Marshalltown for payment of the loan.  I received no cash only a check.  I have no idea what was wrong with the printer but I folded the check and placed it in my billfold.  Upon arrival at the bank the ink was so smeared and illegible that the bank would not accept the check.  Upon return to the store I was told there was nothing that could be done until Monday.  On Monday I was informed that we had to wait 24 hours for the cancelation on the check. Staff should have informed me the location was closing before processing any loan information/paperwork to ensure I wanted to proceed.  The check printed and issued to me should not have and issue with smearing or rubbing off, like it did.  I should not have to had to wait 4 days to ensure the transaction had been cancelled and all business issues resolved.  This was by far the worse action I have encountered with payday loans in the last 20years of my life.  I can see why the location is closing!!"

That would greatly increase my chances of using their product again."

Deidre,"Went online was approved ,then went to location to pick up money, was treated like I was trying to rob someone.  Lady kept asking me for paperwork that was already sent. Too much trouble to go thru for 700 bucks and they wanted me to pay them back 1200. Just God's way of telling me to go somewhere else with a cheaper rate. Yes I have a house ,car , n I work 12 sometimes 13 hour shifts. Every one is not a criminal."
Double zero seven,"Smooth sailing from beginning to end and the representative was very helpful, thorough and polite."
Mary Parsons,"Advance America is no less than a loan shark business. I would rate them zero stars if I could. They prey on the poor and charge criminal interest rates of over 300%. For every $1.00 you borrow you have to pay them $2.50, for a $650 loan you end up paying $1,550. Don't believe their lies of helping Americans to advance in life. Because the only ones that Advance are the banksters, who are  true money loan shark gangsters."
Charity,Always excellent customer service! A clean and friendly environment. Nicole and Bonnie are great at what they do!
Anita,I was told to do one thing then told to do another then another then the chat person said I‚Äôm sorry we can‚Äôt fund you. I have  been using their stores for years. I didn‚Äôt want to go out because of the weather. So I called and talked with someone who was very helpful she stayed on the phone with me the whole time and I finally got it done. Makes me Leary to use the on line system
Linda,"The year 2021 was a turbulent year for me and I found myself needing a small loan, I contacted Advance America and was approved for a loan. The customer service was absolutely wonderful. The store manager and the agent that assisted me was most professional, personable and knowledgeable about the service/loan I applied by going step by step in making sure I completely understand the terms of the loan."

She never wanted me to get approved for the amount I was approved for.  I feel like it was on purpose and very unfair because if I was white I don't think she would do that. I am very upset about how I was treated. I got approved for a one thousand dollars and she did everything not to give me the money going as far as to cancel my loan. The situation was very unfair and unprofessional.  I will never go back. She should be fired. Do not ever let Melinda do your paperwork.

Barbara,"I‚Äôd give a good review but I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôve been doing payday loans with you for years and have always paid off my loans. Every payday I pay off loan and apply for a long term loan and get denied. I‚Äôm borrowing $500 every 2 weeks and paying $88 in interest which equals $166 a month, if I can successfully maintain paying that, I should be able to have a long term loan. You loan companies are loan shark gangsters. I‚Äôm about to find other options and plan to never use your service any longer but I‚Äôm sure that won‚Äôt affect your company because y‚Äôall will take advantage of many others in a bind to make your harsh interest charges.  Y‚Äôall really act like you‚Äôre helping people but really just gangsters are given permission from our also gangster government.  Whoever reads these for the company will wear this on their shoulders and conscience as you know your company is wrong.  Eat crap"

Michael,"This is my first time using this company, Although it was very easy to get some financial help, I kept receiving messages that something went wrong with my account & to contact customer service.I was a bit confused due to the fact that I did receive the funds I requested the very next day.I'm ok with getting a reminder, I actually appreciate it, but getting 15 or so reminders is a bit much, I received reminders via text & email. Also this company doesn't even give the customer time to get paid, they take the money in the middle of the night before you have a chance to collect your paycheck & deposit it.I won't be using this company in the future.Thank you for your help,Sincerely; April Lepe"

Wanda,This location just scammed me for $580 by promising me an $8000 no interest loan.  They instructed me to send them $580 as a deposit and credit repair payment.  I was desperate and dumb enough to stick $580 cash into a Bitcoin kiosk and scan in the QR code they texted me.  Now I'm homeless but hopeful this review will be helpful to you.

I am a cancer patient that needs the extra help and I only asked for a one day extension on paying back my current loan.

Ray,"This is coming from a real Advance America customer, not a bot, not a paid client or anything else. I am a single mother of two teenage daughters. I live off of and support my family with my income as a teacher (which everybody knows doesn‚Äôt mount to a hill of beans unfortunately), but nothing else. I don‚Äôt receive child support or have income coming in from anywhere else. My rent is nearly half my monthly take home pay, so as you can imagine, money is beyond tight, and Lord help me when an emergency arises. I would get so far behind on everything if the slightest unexpected financial obligation popped up. I‚Äôm still working on building my credit from a divorce, so bank loans are not in the cards for me right now. The first time I became in dire straits, I searched and researched every possible avenue for finding a small loan to help me support my family and get me back were I needed to be. The best option I found to fit my needs was Advance America. The initial loan process was a bit tedious, but that‚Äôs only because I‚Äôm pretty introverted and I‚Äôm uncomfortable speaking to people in person at times. In reality and for everyone else, the initial process is a cakewalk lol. I have used Advance America since that first loan, and it‚Äôs been as easy as uploading a picture of my paystub and hitting ‚Äúsend‚Äù. I love that I don‚Äôt have to go through all the verification steps anymore. It‚Äôs so simple and they are always there for me in my time of need. The fees associated with the loans are by far the most reasonable fees anyone in my position could ever find. If I was an accountant, I‚Äôm sure I would be appalled by the fees, but then again if I was an accountant, I would be more financially stable and wouldn‚Äôt need Advance America either, so for me, I don‚Äôt mind paying the fees because it‚Äôs worth it when I need it. Anyone who complains about the fees honestly just needs to more appreciative and grateful that they are as low as they when compared to other payday loan companies. You won‚Äôt find any other company who‚Äôs fees are as reasonable as Advance America‚Äôs, who‚Äôs loan process is simple and quick, who can fund your account as quick, or who‚Äôs payback date is far out enough to give you the time to get yourself financially comfortable again. Advance America is a life saver. I highly, very very highly recommended them for anyone who finds themselves in my situation. It‚Äôs not a hand out, it‚Äôs a hand up, and they don‚Äôt take advantage of people in their times of vulnerability like the vast majority of payday, title, or small loan companies do. If you‚Äôre reading this review trying to compare other companies, or just deciding whether or not to pull the trigger on using Advance America for your loan needs, I‚Äôm here to say look no further and don‚Äôt hesitate. You will feel that relief that you so desperately need, and it‚Äôs not just an instant gratification then regret it later kind of relief either. It‚Äôs a thank Goodness for Advance America kind of feeling of relief that will not leave you ending up feeling disappointed. Honest review from a real customer here. I want to stress that because I know reviews can be misleading. I‚Äôm not here to mislead anyone, I‚Äôm leaving this review to help others who find themselves in desperate times like I have found myself in many times."
Lashenda,Your customer service is great and very efficient and that is why I come back.

Jamila Theriot,"I have been doing business with ""the other guys"" for about 2 years ago and they have so many loopholes and hurdles that you would think they want you to be late with your payment. Like you can not pay with both cash and debit card, its all one or the other. At Advance America, no worries, pay however you want. I had this issue first week in December where I could not pay my loan with ""the other guys"" and decided its just a hassle to do business here now. This is my second loan with Advance America and its been nothing but 5 stars and true customer service and satisfaction right from the start. On this particular loan, I dealt with Allen who far exceeded all expectations. Not only did he allow me to pay my loan with cash and 2 debit cards, which got the job done, his particular location closes at 2pm on Saturday. Not only did Allen stay late with another customer and myself still in the store, he still answered any phone calls that came into this location. He was on the ball, extremely professional, helped me beyond what you would expect, made sure I was able to pay my loan and apply for another and he moved with such precision that I was not sure how he did everything so fast. Kudos to Allen for all of his efforts. Unlike the other guys"" who start yelling at you if you were to walk into their location at say 145pm and they close at 2pm, to get out, they have to close at 2pm on the dot, etc. You get the idea. Doing business with Advance America is well, like a new America, where you are not just a loan or a number but are actually treated with the respect and dignity one would hope to be a recipient of from any payday loan company. Advance America has got the right vision looking forward and they obviousily train and instill into their employees, these same visions and how to treat another human  being and one that had something happen in their lives which brought them into the lobby of a payday loan lender. It is not the easiest thing to do and you have to swallow your pride but one has to do what one has to do. I expected no this, no we can't do that, etc. when I left the location of ""the other guys"" and came over to this Advance America location. Allen did not utter a single no to me and it was yes we can, yes we can, yes we can and I am happy to say I left with the new loan I needed to sustain my present living conditions."

Essence,"4 1/2stars! I would give Advance America 5 or more stars if: A lessor fee was charged for payday loans paid back with in 2 weeks. I only needed to get through 5 more days of the month but the same fee was applied. I am extremely happy with the service in spite of the one issue. Perhaps Advance America will consider implementation of a lessor fee for situations like mine in the future. If so I would have to give 10 stars! The website is easy to navigate and the response was immediate. Also, after approval, if the funds were not deposited right away I had (have) the option of canceling online and then applying again at the Advance America store near my home to receive the cash much sooner. I did not have to do this because luckily the funds I applied for Sunday night were deposited the next business day mid afternoon. Thank you! Please consider my suggestion for a lessor fee for loans paid back within 5 to 15 days! Respectfully A.C. Santa Barbara, Ca."

Emilene,"I used Advance America online recently, got approved quickly but never got my loan proceeds. After paying over $1100 for gift cards to obtain my loan, I gave up because they still wanted me to spend more money out of my pocket before I could receive my loan proceeds. Living on Social Security I really couldn't afford to lose this kind of money. Once I gave up they told me I wouldn't be reimbursed for my expenses of $1100 because I didn't receive the loan. I should mention that one of the reasons I had to purchase so many cards was after purchasing and sending the cards through both email or text message I was told the card was invalid. I checked the value of the last card I sent and 2 hours after Advance America confirmed they received the card, there were 3 transactions made (for $99.98 each) for one specific merchant. The card then had a value of $.06. Out of 6 cards I purchased either online or in store, only 2 of them were good according to Advance America. I would never recommend applying for an online loan with this company. Buyer Beware."

William,"They do what they say - they loan you the money for a ""Payday Loan"" and deposit it into your bank account by the following business day, BUT, they also take the money you owe them out of your bank account THE DAY BEFORE YOUR PAYCHECK IS DEPOSITED INTO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT...  Hence the term ""PAYDAY LOAN"", which means a loan until your next payday or pay date. The result of Advance America taking the money I owed them out of my bank account the day before my payday caused my bank account to be OVERDRAWN. I would give a ""ZERO-0"" Star Rating if Trustpilot gave that option."

I know this is due to training a new customer service person and having to take lunch at the same time as the trainer. This last Friday she was there by herself and again closed when I went. The customer service what‚Äôs always been friendly but not having specified times to be closed to lunch is very frustrating. I shouldn‚Äôt have to make multiple trips because the times that it‚Äôs closed is never consistent. The poor girl there last Friday 11/12 couldn‚Äôt even go to the bathroom because there were people in the lobby, that is horrible for her to endure. I would appreciate it more if there were specified times the business was closed."

The only thing I wish is that after a patron has proved themselves worthy with good payback history, they could increase the amount that you could borrow a little bit even if they had to break the payments up in two months instead of one I've often thought that I could use a little bit more than 450 and I've been an excellent Patron as far as paying back. My review is nothing but excellent all that work at my local Advance America are always wonderful especially Leo who is been there right from the start for me thank you for your service and happy holidays.

Tracy Pollitt,"This company is not what they say they are. They are pushing trying to get people to buy bitcoin. They take all your personal information, and then they are wanting you to send them money back by either going to some store or through bitcoin. They do not work with you on this, they will not use any of the other sending money options that are well known and trusted, not even to gain a customer. One of the questions in the beginning of the process was if I use bitcoin. I said no, and asked why they ask that, and they would not respond to that. Then later I asked if they are a company that sells bitcoin, they stated no, but would not work with me any other way. Complete waste of time, and not good customer service at all. I spoke with Jason Green, Sr. Loan Analyst who just kept saying ok, ok, ok, ok.... I would not recommend this company to a person even if they were a last resort. They are not what they say they are and at the very least, they for sure have horrible customer service and are not willing to do anything more convenient for the sake of gaining a customer."
Antoine Banks,"People very friendly, professional, polite. Angry that the store closed that was close by."
Iris VERDELL,I love Cash Advsnce America!!
Elizabeth AmadapormiRey,"This company has been a total ladder for climbing with the almighty load of no other choice but to advance, whenever optional.  The Advance America program has allowed me to build a building block to afford two used vehicles, but in the great operating shop and purchase my own forever home.  Through this journey, they were never there.  Something like when you say your prayers at night and fall asleep, but when you wake up after a hard day's sleep and an encouraging night of sleep Advance America has always been there for with a promise from them to me and in return, I worked to repay the debt.  Thank you so very much for one of the greatest opportunities of my life, not even your family member would take a chance on doing this for a family member. May you prosper and be forever in business."
Odetta,Quick and friendly service.

Maribel Nino,Their store locations have GREAT people and service. However NEVER use their ONLINE services. They hold your money up wither a payment or a renewal. You tell ONLINE that you will be doing a debit card payment . they go into your account take the money then YOU HAVE to upload PROOF that they TOOK your payment.
Mari,"Melissa Robles in Livingston,Tx location helped and explained the installment loan process. Getting funds was not a hassle and time consuming. Was done in a very good amount of time. Very happy she helped me!"

Kathi,I recently took out a cash loan for 300 dollars for emergency medical care.  It ended up being more than expected and I called the same store to see if I could borrow a little more. The guy got smart with me and actually started laughing at me because I didn't know I would have to pay back the 300 first. That was not explained to me. Will never use them again
Victor,"Excellent service ,She was polite and helpful"
Susan,The repay. you toke out of my payment so fast on the dayi.i need to pay back.but when i need to take out another loan.it take way to long to process. when i can get it the money same when i  pay.it .i told the employee i would pay the money.but still toke the money out

Earl,I applied and requested an in store pick up - 1 arrived at 1130 after driving an hour and a half to the closest store and was told they didn‚Äôt have any money to fund my loan - no options were provided- I returned the next day and was told the same thing- I called customer service and was told they would provide a debit card or check - this process required 3 trips to complete and cost me $ 40 I‚Äôm gas and 4 hours of driving- the dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever heard was a loan Buisness that doesn‚Äôt have money
Stephen,Terrible place. Do yourself a favor and give any other loan place a shot. I settled my account with them in June. I tried to apply for one today in October and they tell me that I have a unsettled account. Waste of time and gas. Mind you it wouldn‚Äôt allow me to apply on line. I called them to verify that my account was in good standing they suggested that I go to the store and my account was fine. Just for them to say my account is unsettled but they see I paid it off months ago so to try again in a few days. Unorganized and unprofessional.
Tae Dionne T Jones,"Always helpful, in times of difficulties, understanding!!"
Verdell Duggan,"You have been a great help. It's helped me through a couple of really rough spots.Its nice to have you there to help watch my back.I appreciate you all in helping me and taking a chance,and believing in me when all others wouldn't.

Pauline,I was treated very well by the staff and was through the process in a short time. Thank you
Antoinette,I didn't see anything telling me I had to enter my payment on the due date. Previously it was automatically taken out on my debt card.

Marcia,"I was using a different online payday loan place (Check N Go) for a couple years and needed to borrow back the $255 for rent each month. Things were going smooth until last month the website (Pocket 360) kept saying ""Verification Failed"" and i couldn't log in, rent was due.Their Support made me take a screenshot of the Banner that wouldn't allow me to log in and send it to them, i did, easy enough. Then they sent it somewhere within their business and told me to wait for an e-mail that was suppose to arrive between 24 and 48 hrs. I waited 24hrs and contacted them twice each time their hands were tied and i was told to wait for e-mail..RENT WAS DUE so i called Advance America and spoke with Emily here in Redding. She let me know what paper work was needed for Verification. Because i kept all that important stuff together already i was at the store in 30mins.Thinking to myself oh god here we go again, something always goes wrong or back home for different papers. My mind was blown when we were done and i was out the door in under 30mins... They really stepped up when i needed it.. Thanks Advance America    Larry"

Christine,"Normally, when I am preapproved, the approval goes through right away.  This time it was after my bank opened and I had to sign again, even though I had already signed the previous day when it was pending approval.  Bottom line, I had an NSF fee.UPDATE:  Reply stated someone from Advance America would contact me, but two days later and still no one has done so.Latest UPDATE:  I did hear back a day or so later.  They refunded my NSF fee, therefore increasing my rating to 3."

Angela,"Called in June 2021 to compare rates, spoke to a very knowledgeable man on the phone who gave the information to applying online versus in the store. Came in person in October 2021 after going to a competitor for a few months. Was given twice what the other place gave me, and up to 4 months to pay it back. I was loaned one-third of my gross monthly pay, based on your last paycheck only. Different man waited on me than on the phone, equally as professional. Nice to see all employees wearing masks and hand sanitizer for the clients. They have revolutionized the short term loan industry. Will recommend to friends. My advice to you, pay back early if you can or pay a little more than due each time so they are at least charging interest on a smaller amount, as you are saving a lot in interest if you do. You really do not want to pay that interest."
Trevon,No hassle and fast and dependable service!
Michael,Hello yes  I felt  committed thank you every time I come they are always friendly I like that and again thanks much appreciate

There was notes made at the store that it was not supposed to be taken out on the 8th which it said online instead the store put it for the 13th when my husband got paid. They had pulled the main girl from that store to another store for just a few days and the person that was there went ahead and sent it through our bank on the 8th instead of doing her job and reading the notes that was left for her. Now they say it takes 5 to 7 days great to get back to them and them reimburse us what's in the meantime I'm overdrawn because of it and I cannot use my debit card until Advance America gets this back to me. NEVER TRUST THE ONLINE

Jaime LaSalle,"I have been working out of town on a project and made a special trip back to Michigan to reloan last Saturday October 2, 2021. Before I left to head back to Michigan, I did the on line reloan. No problem. So I knew I should be able to reloan back in a Michigan office. There was a problem and your system said I still had an open loan but SoM said they were all closed with the new online loan open. The store manager Lisa was on hold for 40 minutes with customer service trying to get this resolved. She never got through. Driving back to Michigan was a huge waste of a day.

Lakesaun,"Just signed up for online site. It was very user friendly. One suggestion about Advance America I do have is that I think a lowered interest rate on payday loans for long term members would be a nice way to show appreciation to the business these clients have brought to Advance America. I can't see where lowering the rate for long term members in good standing from 107+% to even 20% less would be harmful to Advance America, and give help to clients that could really use the help."

I have a difficult time with not getting a full 30 days(if I borrow on the 5th or 6th, shouldn't repay date be the same??)to repay.  I get reminder calls & emails stating I missed my payment when it isn't even my due date yet!!  I am told it is ""the system"" but I have had several clerks do the right thing & have my repayment date as it should be!!  But overall nice place to get a helping hand when you need a little extra!"

Roger,"Yes, there‚Äôs been a couple of mistakes and problems that we‚Äôre not exactly handled the best. The first problem was I called the customer assistance number to get onto a government payment plan for my online loan. After being on hold for 51 MINUTES  I was finally disconnected. And this is since I gave up and just really long which cost me a extra $30-$40. Next, was a mistake made by a customer assistance operator. I called in to once again get on a payment plan (I couldn‚Äôt make it to the store) this time for my in-store loan.  I had just taken out an online loan about 2 to 3 hours earlier. I talk to the customer care assistant and they said they could put it on a payment plan no problem. Come to find out they put the loan I just taken out three hours ago on a payment plan and my other loan was still due. So fast forward two weeks later and I‚Äôm in the store to pay back and re-loan and I‚Äôm told that I‚Äôm not eligible. I called customer care and was told I had to clear it up with a agency in Michigan. I called the agency up and they said they have no way of taking me off a payment plan and I need to call back to advance America. I was able to get on with a different customer care specialist and they were able to solve the problem. Unfortunately, this took me over an hour to get cleared up. So you might ask why after all these problems didn‚Äôt i file complaint before. I understand in these times businesses are having trouble running as efficiently as they would like. But you did send me an email asking for my feedback, so I‚Äôm providing it. I hope that not only for your business but for all the other businesses that are struggling things get better."
