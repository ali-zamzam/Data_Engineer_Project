"In response to your recent inquiry, our records indicate you currently have a Flex Loan issued under Tennessee terms. The Flex Loan is a credit line in which you can borrow as much as you want, up to the approved credit limit, whenever you want, as long as your minimum payments are made and your account is in good standing. With the exclusive Flex Loan product, you have multiple payment options. You can choose between making just a Minimum Payment, making additional payments, or paying in full. Making additional payments or paying the balance earlier helps reduce the interest and possibly the charges you pay. With the Flex Loan, you have much more control. Keep in mind, if your account balance is $0 then you owe $0 and your Flex Loan remains open for a long time. As long as you do not miss any payments and your account is not past due, you will be able to request advances up to your credit limit. Keep in mind, as you repay principal, more of your credit line will be available for advance requests.Under the terms of your Flex Loan, you are charged a customary fee of .69% of your principal outstanding balance, multiplied by the number of days in your billing cycle. In addition, you are charged periodic interest. The periodic interest rate is 24%. The APR is based on the periodic interest rate and the customary fee rate used to compute finance charges on the cash advances. The APR is 278.85%. This information can be reviewed by logging into your account online at www.cashnetusa.com and reviewing your contract.Minimum payments are due on your pay dates. Minimum payments will be calculated as follows:Biweekly and twice monthly customers:The greater of the following:5% x Principal +  (Accrued Interest + Customary Fees)5% of the Customer's Credit LimitThe payment will never be greater than $450 or the accrued interest + fees, whichever is greater.The due date and minimum payment amount will be shown on each periodic statement available online at www.cashnetusa.com at the close of each billing cycle."

"Hi Marlene, we are sorry to hear this. It seems you have been contacted by fake collectors. The fraudsters who have contacted you are in no way associated with CashNetUSA and unfortunately, we are unable to control any of their actions. Much of what the fraudsters say when they make calls or send emails  is untrue. We are unaware of any actions taken by the fraudsters other than making these calls. The fraudsters make many threats in an attempt to convince people to pay them and make the calls stop. If you have additional questions or concerns, we would encourage you to contact your local authorities or the FTC. If you are contacted by fake collectors in the future, it is best to not make any payments unless they can validate the debt. If you need additional assistance, please contact our Customer Service Department at 888-801-9075."
