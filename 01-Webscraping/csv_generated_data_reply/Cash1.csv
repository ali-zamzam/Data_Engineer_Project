Joseph morris,I called cash net after one day after filing for help from cash net. I have received offers from cash net before yet had not filed because yet while times were hard I wasn't sure that I could pay it back  I spoke with Alexis and she patiently waited for me to provide the desired information for a loan  thank you very much for helping me and my daughter.
Sarah C.,"I had an amazing customer service experience! I spoke with such a nice lady who was eager and happy to help me, I felt like she genuinely cared about answering my questions and I ended the phone call feeling even more confident about using CashnetUSA!!"
Chauncey Turzinski,Just disappointed in myself for applying for loans with 300% interest (only blaming myself)Also the issue where I never received my 25% discount or it was 25$ can't remember it goes all the way back to my first or s cond loanThank you for your timeChauncey Turzinsk
Lynn D.,"CashNet is the #1 lender for short term, emergent loans! Easy online setup and payment system, same day deposits, all online! I was able to pay my loan back fast, where as other lenders are not reliable and offer high interest rates (so you can give them back 9-10 times the original!)"
Misty,This is a good company which puts common sense solutions to any problems which can arise. Thank you for all that the Cashnet team continues to do for the clients.
CHERYL,I’ve always been very happy with cash net USA I’ve never had a problem they’re very kind considerate and I’ve always been there for me when I need them thank you very much for all you do for me Cheryl
Nikita,"It’s a good way to get a loan without perfect credit. You will obviously pay insane fees. What irritated me is when I needed to change my card, I chatted with a rep who told me it was all clear. Then they attempted to debit an old card, which will fail. I contacted chat again, then they told me they can’t accept my bank. I pay on time always. And now I will be late due to no fault of mine. Very inconvenient."
Mark,You guys make everything very painless and easy. The interface is easy to operate the communication with your client base is excellent. Thank you guys for helping me get through a tight crunch
Carl,I’ve been using CashNet for over a year now. Quick and easy to get money when you need it. Sure you pay a little in interest but that’s the price you pay for having bad credit right.
Mrs Nevaquaya,I am recently a widdow and have 3 small children that needed help with income and this was fast and a blessing coming our way...
CONNIE Luons,It's really helped me since I get paid once a month. However didn't really realize the payment on 1500.00 would be 400.00 now I won't do that much .
Glitz Smith,They are there when you need them and will always have your back. Outstanding customer service always there to help. CashNetUSA is my place to go when I’m in of help.
Lelia,"Aaron's polite, professional and proficient customer service skills were a welcomed breath of fresh air!  I had an issue that needed to be taken care of today and it was! I thank you for having him on your team!!!! Kudos Aaron for a job well done!"
JeffS,"If I could write zero stars, I would. You cannot talk to a person by using the phone calling their support number. There are no options to talk with anyone. I didn’t know what the payments would be before I applied and now I can’t afford it. just an awful experience that I don’t need right now."
Debra,DO NOT USE CASHNET USA! BEWARE!!!!Last month I contacted CashNet USA to pay my account in full. The transaction was completed and they drafted the funds from my account. I received an email stating I still owed $700 and they would be drafting from my account on a designated day. How can this be when last month I was told it was paid in full. PLEASE BEWARE!!!  They are not reputable!!!
Antoinette,"I appreciate the assess of line of credit you supply to those that have an account with you, However, I am NOT impressed by the payback amount. Every other week is a horror story of your payments you take out of my check. With other responsibilities I have your payment schedule amount is madness. I hope to never have to need you again"
Veronika Jenrette,"HIGH INTEREST RATEI have been a customer with CasNetUSA for over a year now.  My only concern is the high interest rate they charge (300%) on the balance of my loan!  Is there any way to reconsider lowering the interest? I have been a loyal customer, with an excellent record on paying my dues on time."
Shelton,I was involved in a car accident that put me out of work cash net pushed my payments back long enough for me to get caught up and said call and let us know if the dates are still to soon. Thank you Cash Net USA!
Vickie,My Experience was awesome everyone I spoken with was so nice An patience with me.I Really Do Appreciate That You Have Such A Good Group out of the thee I've talked to so far Hàve Good Customer service Team  .. on 10-12-2022- 10-13-2022
JOHNNIE,I love going thru yall! Everytime I apply yall give me my loan! It's the best interest rate I've seen with loan companies! Yall work with your customers! ❤️
Sallie Butcher,I've been with Cashnet USA for a very long time.  I took care of my obligation and didn't have to use Cashnet USA for quite awhile.  Life happened and Cashnet USA was right there.I'm very satisfied.
Totty B.,"i WOULDNT RECOMMEND A DOG TO COME GET A LOAN FROM THESES PEOPLE, they charge $10 of interest per day ! Which makes sire that you NEVER get the loan paid off !"
Rebecca Van Hoosen,They were very useful when I needed them. The interest accrues pretty much every day. If you get a large loan it is very hard to pay back even when you do pay extra. Just be careful with how much you take.
Kelvin,CasshNetUSA provided me with an opportunity to alleviate some of the pain of worrying about how to resolve some of my existing debt.
RALA,I really like the customer support when I have a issue they are professional and prompt and put me first this makes my experience better I can count on CashNetUSA when I need some financial support.
Patrick Waugh,"CashNetUSA is a great service for very short term, payday-like loans.  Because their APR is like 300%, never use them if you can’t pay it off in full quickly.  Use Solo (iPhone app) for lower rates. Both are very easy to sign up with and use, and very quickly provide funding you need. I highly recommend them."
B B,I really like Cash Net they are always there when I need them. I just wish that they would increase my limit. But I am really thankful for Cash Net.
B,Answered all questions was fast from beginning to end gave me all answers to questions I had from applying to having questions about after approval
Bo,This company is dangerous. Once you take out a loan. Good luck..they make sure you'll wont be able to pay it off. Paid ahead of time only to find out it did not matter. They still going to keep raising your amount.
IYANNA,"It was super easy to do the application, I got a good amount approved and it took only 2 days for funds to be deposited. It was overall a smooth process. They didn’t pay me to make this review."
JT,"I've been making my payments on time, every time, but I haven't gotten an increase in a very long time."
Crystal brown,I did take out a few loans but the interest is ridiculous. I am not borrowing anymore money and just wanna pay my balance of as soon as possible. Sorry but I will never use this again.
Cieairo Tarver,"I never had a problem with this company until now. I advise no one to do business with this company and I will make sure it does get told across advertisements. The second to last customer service’s rep provided misleading information. I have the app installed on my phone, can access any funds at any time. There was a low balance to pay on my account but if I need more I can get more. But before completing my process through the app wanted to make sure I was able to afford the payment’s. Spoke with the guy he explain he can’t provide the exact amount but will not exceed over $350. Because we want to make sure people are able to pay back their loan. So after he explained the information and looking over my I account. Completed everything through the app. Then new bill cycle generated check the portal my damn payments almost $400 dollars. If the guy would have provided correct information I would never pushed forward. So after seeing the information in the portal I contacted customer services. The lady explained she apologize for the misleading information she can split the payment up. I can’t do that every time this is ridiculous I will go further to push this matter even if I have take it to court. All calls are recorded so they will have play back the information on those days I contacted customer services."
Lesa M,"Easy access, quick delivery of cash when needed, and fast credit of payments"
RACHAEL,My experience was easy fast. Not alot of paper work. Just give the basic personal information wait a few minutes to be accepted. Then check your bank account in a few hours. Then do what you need to do with your money.

Shuna,I normally woulda been giving a great review since never had any issues with them .. however recently I tried renewing & now denied in which the denial states something to the effect of not enough creditials which is incorrect Due to I have always paid back early & in full & a day before I decided to take the loan I had already been approved .. had I known it was gonna change I would have just renewed that day

BRITTANY,"I was happy that I could get a loan and, I needed cash real fast. It was fast and, it was a nice experience."
Ginger Holtsclaw Centers,"It was never clear to me how much i was going to pay and how often i was going to pay i was borrowed 1,100 and interest was like 500$ and i have to pay $186.00 every 2 weeks this is ridiculous instead of helping they are screwing me i have a $3,500 loan through the bank and its monthly and its $70 less i will NEVER get a loan through these people again they are thieves in disguise 🥸 I cant wait to pay them off!!! Bunch of crooks!! All i see is bad reports idk what i was thinking!!I highly don’t recommend these people to anyone!!"

"Timothy-Leesburg,VA",Website was easy to get through also I was approved within minutes of applying
Carm,Quick approval which is great for a time of need but the interest rates are TERRIBLE.
Dustin Pulley,Always there for me with outstanding service!
Cindy,Called cashnet USA today as they requested about the 300% interest rates. They won't work with you except to extend payments or split them getting you farther and farther into debt as they continue to collect that high interest. It's like $14 a day!!!!  Being on social Security and elderly doesn't mean anything to them. Companies like this force you into bankruptcy.  I have a $2500 loan with another on line company and payments are not even half that.  All I can say is I would highly recommend against borrowing from this company.
Travis,Approval was very fast and courteous and really got me out of a jam
RONALD,"Website is super user friendly. This is fast and easy money, but horribly expensive. The interest makes it impossible to pay down if you can’t pay the whole balance right away."
Jennifer,Love CashNetUSA they are great company you get your money the same day and when you pay your payment you can get another portal loan I don't know much on how to explain it but its been a big help for me I so Glad I found this coupon thanks CashNetUSA
Jayelyne ,Excellent attention to my needs. Made me feel important to the company
Virginia,Very good company.  Willing to work with you if problems arise.  Recommend highly.
Kristian,I never get my money same day. When it says it's going to deposit next day be late the next day and still have missed everything I need to pay. So usually takes 2 days to get it but my payments be on time. No problem.
MONIQUE,Highly recommend CashNetUSA. Super quick and easy process. Funds same day. Great company
Deedra,Got the money the same day. Helpful.
Jennifer P,It was great satisfying efficient well explained detailed the young lady that helped me deserves a raise
MICHAEL,The representative was very helpful and knowledgable! She understood my concern and explained it to ny understanding!
customer,This company is a company that takes advantage of individuals. It charges the highest rate possible on daily interest. You can only hope they get ran out of business by reasonable companies that offer fair and affordable rates. BestEgg offers actual companies with normal loans. This place is operated like a check writing service. Do not use them. I got a $1500 loan and my first 3 payments will add up to $1300 then I will be expected to continue payments until April of 2024.
Damah,Always there when I need them! An absolute life saver. Keep up the fantastic work.

Wanda,I just got ruled as disabled and need help paying my recent loan
DEBRA,Helpful and friendly

Tawny Spragling,Outstanding service.  Easy to work with and customer service reps. are knowledgable and polite.
Shavon Taylor,"Amazing company. They are so incredibly helpful and willing to work with their clients. Communication is key and this company has been fast in response, and knowledgeable when inquiring about my account. Thank you!"
Amalia A,I thank you for the help. But taking payment out of each paycheck that leaves nothing to pay bills with or buy food is becoming a burden!!
STEPHEN ECKHARDT,I love cashnet my line of credit has came in handy I don't know how many times and if something comes up with a payment they are very easy to work with I recommend them to everyone I know when they talk about getting a loan thank you cashnet.
Loye,"The young lady who helped me, after I had issues online finishing up the application, was the best customer service person I've ever dealt with. I applaud her for helping me. She made me feel important. Thank you!!!"
Rocky Romano,"Taking your money back,on time! Doing good!"
Steven,They are awesome. Been with them years. Never any harassment from them. Love because when need that little extra help there always there for ya. Payment plan very affordable.
Marna,I am a satisfied customer and I respect the company that I borrow and make loans through .Cashnetusa will always be my first choice in all my financial matters.I reccomend Cashnetusa  and trust them emphatically. Thank you Cashnetusa.
Wayne,I don’t like the fact that it takes days for my payment to post which appears as if I’ll never paid it off unless the scheduled payment plus additional monies is paid too!! It deters you from having an available balance to draw from and it appears the payment isn’t getting paid down.
Charlie Hancock,Very friendly and knowledgeable
Brian,Predatory loan terms that should be criminal and fined into bankruptcy.
Shelby Colman,I was able to request the draw I needed and it was deposited into my checking the same day.
Frankie,"CashNetUSA have been a blessing to me, because I needed money right now. They help me out and I will tell anybody to try they. God bless."
SARAH,"Very fair, have the best rates above all cash advance companies. Excellent Customer Service."
Gloria,Well I thought I made arrangement to pay my bill and now may account is in overdraft because of the payment
Loyz,Payments and interest way too high!! They don't properly inform you of what you're getting into. It's a scam!!!!! I paid my balance in less than 2 months and canceled my account!
jennifer,Very helpful and always has the cash when I need it. Very.fast and prompt.
John Farber,They can and will help with a small loan to help in a time of need.
Brian,They provided me with the money that I needed right in the knick of time. I would recommend them if you find yourself in a bind.
Jimmie,Payments are way too high that I can not keep up. They keep raising my credit limit when I did not ask them to!
Donna,THIS IS A TOTAL RIP OFF TO ME! IN JULY I GOT A LOAN OF $900. THEY DO A DIRECT WITHDRAWAL FROM MY ACCOUNT BI-WEEKLY WHEN I AM PAID. THEY HAVE TAKE OUT OF ATLEAST 6 OF MY CHECK. EANGING FROM $100-$160. WHY SHOULD I STILL HAVE A BALANCE OF $825? WHY MUST INTEREST CHARGES KEEP ADDING UP IF I AM ON A PAYMENT PLAN WITH THEM BI-WEEKLY?? AN ABSOLUTE RIP OFF!! NEVER AGAIN WILL I EVER DEAL WITH THEM OR RECOMMEND ANYONE TO THEM!!
DANA,My experience with Cashnet has been very good.
Christine,"Beware! CashNet are always there when you need it. However, be careful! The loan docs don't say how much you will be paying each payment until you get approved and the money is already on the way. I personally used them a few years ago and again just a few months ago with no change in how they do business. Payments are super high (car payment) for the first few months and then get lower to where you can afford it. It is not a steady payment plan where you can budget. I have it listed under ""last resort"" when I need a loan because of this. Beware!"
Priscilla,I wish the payment could be Aa smaller amount each month.  I had no ide it would be as large as it is.
Ceterra,"I appreciate your company lending me money. I am having a hard time paying off the balance before another payment is due. Is there anything your company can do to lessen this burden on me. I understand if you can’t, it’s just hard to make a $800 payment on a $3000( approximately) three or 4 months and still owe the majority of the principal. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you."
Rt,"CashNetUsa has taught me a very important lesson--make sure you read all the fine print before you make a deal. About a month ago I borrowed $1500 and was hit with an automatic withdrawal payment of over $350 for my first payment. Now I have a $430+ payment due and owe a total of over $1700.. The key to doing business with this company is to be able off your entire bill before the first payment is due, otherwise you will hand out money until you run out of it completely."
MYRIAM,They were quick and efficient.
Patricia,"So easy to use and helpful when help can seem hard to find. Thank you, CashNet!"
Danny Gilbert Jr.,"It’s been very helpful to have you guys a click away, especially in an emergency. Recently I got Covid, followed by pneumonia and laryngitis. Being out of work was scary, but cashNetUSA was able to help with my bills. While the interest rate is insanely high, it’s good to know you’re there.( just wish you were cheaper lol)"
Jacqueline,"I am so impressed with the speed, efficiency and ease of your service."
Deanna Legrand,Very friendly cusiomer service interaction who explained how the process worked. The process was speedy and simple.
joyce,I won't be using yall again after I get yall paid off because it's impossible  to pay yall back in payments.  I don't make enough money to pay it all back at one time and every time I make a payment even if it's over what I owe on that statement by the time I make another payment it's like I haven't paid anything
Jose,"They helped me when I needed it, quick and responsive to you. Thank you!"
Amber Stanford,Well it’s great to be able to get a loan base on your credit but not good to keep raising the price for payment everytime you get paid! I am getting further in hole with this loan than I ever did! I can’t wait to pay it off because now I know I won’t do this again
blanca vrotsos,"CashNet has been a life saver for us many times,The service is Great and really simple and reliable to use I would refer anyone who needs a fast easy way to get out of a cash flo bind... like the add says,,,Moneys On The Way with CashNet"

Glenn,I really appreciate the help with my issue. Patricia was helpful and patient with me.
Antonia Valadez,CaahNet has been a great  help with some financial needs. I have always had a good experience with CashNet. Thank all whom has worked with me.
Rebecca,If you guys had a smaller payment amount it would really make a world of a difference repaying the loan back those large payments are sometimes difficult 🤔
Janice,"Never have a problem, when I call the people I speak to are helpful and friendly, great service  THANKS"
STEVEN,Always easy to get request and questions answered! Very easy navigation of my online account

Margaret,"I just want to start out saying Aubrey (1589) was listening an she heard me,she was absolutely amazing I don't believe in my 50 years here that Aubrey was the kindness person ever, my over all experience with CashNetUsa is better than awesome, they are honest an worry for there customer all of my questions were answered, they also take care of you when you need or have an emergency, they make sure I have all my needs met this company they really do work with you CashNetUsa is a number 10 out of a 10,"
Anita,Interest and monthly payments are extremely to much.
Earlean,You might as well be loan shark s charging so much interest rate every day
Christie,The biggest thing is how high the payments are and the fact they are bi weekly. I wish it was more like a medium term loan
"Arnold, Rosaland",Good morning I need a other Loan about $150 r $200 please thanks
AUBREY,Cash net hase been great they are there when you need them.
Stacey Thomas,We have always been able to access funds when needed. Thank you !

Melinda,THEY ARE POLITE BUT SOMETIME I THINK THE PAYMENTS SHOULDN'T BE SO HIGH
LaNitra,Cashnet USA has been great for me. I have been able to keep up with medical expenses and medications thanks to how easy it is to get the funds I need.
Karosiea Williams,The way you help people with no so good credit is great. However the amount that due every two weeks is high and makes it where I cannot pay off due to needing to borrow bc of how much is due. Maybe go to a smaller payment or just once a month.
Mary M,I'm writing this review because of the great service that I've been receiving from your company.
Club member,"Very helpful and courteous,  fast service !"
Joe,Payments are too high and causes more financial hardship. It’s hard to pay this off because you are paying way too much in interest. Would not recommend this business.
Cheryl S,Be careful with using the caculate payments feature.  I use it to make sure I can cover my payments but it is NEVER accurate.  One was even $100 more then what was calculated and it caused a problem because I was not prepared for that large payment.
TESSIE,"CashNet has been a lifesaver on many occasions. If you need some quick cash, they are there to serve. They will also work with you when you are having a problem with a payment and I should know. I highly recommend!"

She did an amazing work with the issue and got it resolved. Also she was not like most advisors hateful, demanding or disrespectful. Keep up the awesome work and when those bad surveys come in from people that won’t let you emphasize with let that roll off your shoulders, for they could not do what you are doing every day! Kudos 😊"

Dolores Daly,Customer service lady was very friendly & helpful.  She made the process easy
Laneteria Riggins,I needed to change my name. I was able to open a chat and get the information i needed without being on hold for minutes or hours like other companies.
Ruby Marquez,I have been using them for a few years when times get hard I will get a draw. They have always sent the draw. And I have always paid them. Be careful how much you get unless your prepaid for the long term payment. As with any loan. They’re great to work with. Any payment you make other than the biweekly payment you agree too goes to the loan no interest.
Juanita,I appreciate that the agent spoke clearly and knew what my issue was and did all she could to help me.I have difficulty hearing and understanding people who speak English as a second language.

Mkg,"The customer service was great very helpful and knowledgeable, very professional and very polite"
Lorenzo,ALL WAS VERY GOOD!
Ro Allison,"Was happy overall with seeing it would be in my account the next day. When I logged in at the top it said it would be deposited today, but when I scrolled down to pending transactions it said 2-5 business days. I know it said it could depend on the bank. I'm not sure why it would say deposited the next day but when I logged in just to find out I have to wait two to five business days. I just needed the money to get by until payday but It seems I will get paid before it is even deposited. Just a little confused because in my email and at the top it said it will be deposited today and haven't received the deposit or any emails regarding the loan except to leave a review and that funds would be available today. Just overall confused with being told two different things when I logged in today."
Stephen Chase,She explained everything to me exactly what I need to do

Jamie Hon,Kimberly was very polite and efficient on the call she knew exactly what she was doing. Helped resolve my issues and I was very thankful for it. Also asked if I had any other questions and she answered my question.
Jamie Hon,"I like being able to just go into my account, look at how much I have to borrow. Put in the amount, then the best thing is being able to see how much your payments are going to be. Which is actually very helpful, so you know if you will be able to make that payment or not. You can still borrow a little less or a little more to make that next payment. Perfect concept and very helpful. I'm glad it's there, so you won't make a problem for yourself."

LASHUNDA,So far so good. I got the money very quickly well the same day at least and it was an emergency and I needed it. I'm just hoping I don't regret it I and it was an emergency and I needed it.

RJR,Got my money quick in fast didn’t take that long of a process
Renica,Easy online application process.
Timothy,I am grateful for CashNetUSA acceptance of me having a line of credit.  My biggest issue is the high interest rate I continue to have after proving my credit worthiness for years.  I truly believe that there should be a gradual reduction in the interest rate when you pay on time and don’t miss any payments.
Douglas Smith,"I was surprised about how much my payments were this time around! Was not THAT much with my first loan experience. On the plus, you are still easy and convenient!!"

The customer service is great! They are clear, and they are family people. If you miss a payment or get behind they have ways to help you instead of sending you to collections. Definitely will be having them around for a while."

Also I'm planning on paying 200.00 on the 14th this month and 200.00 on Oct 14th and what ever the interest I owe. There wasn't a place on the computer showing I could borrow 400.00 only.

I say the loans are okay because if you can pay them off early or pay the balance back quickly it's a great deal,  but that line of credit is crap no matter how you pay they take interest I paid 250 bucks early I got 32 dollars towards my line of credit . You can't pay it back early all payments made early just go towards your next payment do not use their line of credit they rape you financially"

In a bind and actually need a short term loan ASAP because my health is in danger so I have a dialogue over the phone with an agent who needs to email me information to complete for approval...odd, I thought i was pre-approved.....sure, I will oblige. Nope, unable to get a loan via the website...stop sending out spam mailers casting a wide net to get people tangled in 325%+ APR Loans. 3Fs82St8wQ9s6sTW9Q2YmrNtHEJKkwW4KA"
Theresa,Spoke clear and where I could understand
Sheila Howard,Horrible I would never use again. I payed back way more than I borrowed. It’s a scam made to take advantage of people who are in desperate need for money. You are better off getting a credit card or using a local small loan place.

I like the line of credit better than regular loan bc if you ever need just a few extra dollars you can easily draw from your line of credit instead of getting hit with overdraft fees or looking for another loan. The online chat is a great tool as well getting to speak with someone in real time without waiting on hold.

Tracie Wilson,The loan process were very easy I was very satisfied with the way everything went
YOLANDA,The APR is duck you high. Think 126% and they don’t give you a way to know before you’ve opted in and signed a contract. They’re anti-Robinhood and steal from the poor to give to themselves.

Tonya,I love the service you provide....need a credit limit increase...lol

Ryan,Good job enthusiast
Robin,This is an employee that any organization should be proud to have.  She offered me a solution to accommodate my needs.  This only happened because of her help!  Kudos!
CECIL,"This company is all talk and no action. Same-day funding? Yeah right, after a week long processing period!!! The amount of information they ask for when they claim you are preapproved is simply unbelievable!!! It rivals a home mortgage and I’m not over exaggerating. There’s absolutely nothing preapproved about their preapproval, trust me!  Three months worth of FULL (every single page) bank statements, access and login information to your personal checking account, plus a slew of other things! That’s an invasion of privacy it’s none of their business what I spend my money on. Absolutely under no circumstances should you waste your time dealing with this company. And you can take that to the bank, because it’s the ONLY thing you’re going to take to the bank from them…No doubt like my other reviews, they will promptly respond (it’s the only time you will get a prompt response from them) and try to make it sound like they genuinely care, tell you to please call this number and ask to speak to a member of management, they are awaiting your call, blah blah, and it’s just the EXACT same every day 800 number that you can never get through on or speak to a human. In fact there’s not even an option to speak to somebody!!! You have to work your way around it going through the back door and picking wrong options. If by some miracle you do get through? The people who pick up the phone don’t have a freaking CLUE about you or your review! They just make a response to save face and mislead the reader into thinking they care.Walk away from their offers. Better yet? RUN.Update: Like I stated. Less than 24 hours later they have responded and list the same phone number…"

Pamela W.,"Not sure about Cash Net.  They said I was approved for $3000 then they deposited 476.99 in my account and wanted me to buy a prepaid card and send them back 451.00.  Then the next day they deposited 900 in my acct and wanted me to send 451.00 back to them.  Still no loan papers to sign and now they want me to send them back another 451.00 because I used ""my"" money the 2nd time.  Still no loan documents.  Sounds like a scam"

I would recommend them to anyone, however, sadly they do not provide loans in my state of Maine any longer. It is with great sadness I bid Cashnet farewell. Unfortunately, Maine's current government is driving our state into the ground, and this is yet another example of their incompetence. Thanks Cashnet !

I wished I would of never done this. Lets say it will suck the life out of people struggling and throw them into more debit. RUN AND DON'T PUSH THE BUTTON ACCEPTING THE LOAN IT WILL MAKE YOU IN A MORE IN DEBIT WITH NO WAY OUT SCAM SLIMEBUCKETS. Oh by the way you can never get a person on the phone at the number they provided below to discuss anything. I paid my outstanding balance on Friday before the 15th and they still took that money and 211.00 payment called and they said that we owed to them no matter what I am reporting them to Attorney General this is crap DO NOT USE THIS OR YOU WILL PAY FOR IT MAKES NO DAMN SENSE TO ME IF I PAID IN FULL BEFORE PAYMENT DATE AND THEY STILL TAKE OUT ON THE 15TH.
Debra,Thank you for helping in our emergent need

jean,"Kenesha at Cash Net USA was very knowledgeable when it comes to fraudulent companies who say you are approved for a loan. From now on, I will only trust calling the authentic number associated with Cash Net USA."
Maria,"It's great service and easy and fast access to cash  , the only problem I have with is the amount of money 💰 taken out of your account monthly to pay it back  , the every other week is hard for me right now  , once a month would be a lot better for me  , but thanks anyway 👍🏾"
Charles,I was able to get funds when I needed them and paying it off was not bad because the interest rates were not too high. I will use them again if needed.
Eva,Absolutely too high of an interest rate for payments. Craziness. I paid it back almost immediately!

Beatrix,This is very terrible yall interest rate is terrible
Manuel,I was under the impression this was an installment loan when I took it out. Ended up being a line of credit with ridiculous interest compiled daily.

Bonita C,Intrest rates are ridiculously high and payments are astronomically high2000 loan is around 600 a month mostly interest.
malaika,"If I could give no stars, I would. Not your fault, but a lot of people don’t read fine print. The fact that the interest rate goes up each day, you charge twice each two weeks is absurd."

I was then informed that I had given my account and routing orders in the wrong order. The lady told me that I should get an email stating the funds were returned and for me to call back and we would get it straight. I'm going to be honest, I like doing business at a place that's treats their clients professional and respectful."

RENEE,We needed a smaller loan for our expenses and this is just what we needed. It was easy to apply and received approval right away. I have never experienced this type of loan in that we can pull out what we need at the time and more later. A few options for payments which is also nice.
Sarah,Great job on helping me with my problems
Deborah,"I would run far and quick from getting a loan thru CashNetUSA.  First, the interest will kill you.  Second, the payments are ridiculous.  The payments on a 2k loan were 325 dollars every two weeks for six months.  I would recommend trying every avenue possible before using them for money.  Don’t let this company take advantage of your situation."

DELORIS,It is easier and cheaper to just borrow money from the local check into cash. I can pawn something locally and pay a 15 dollar fee. If I cant pay back my loan I just pay 15 again for the next month.
LARRY,It was easy as 123 the staff was helpful answered all if my concerns and I was approved for a line of credit thank you CashnetUSA

DANIEL,"Hello, thanks for the big help, it really help me pay for my vehicles payment and bought groceries"
ANGELA THE 😲 LADY,A great experience
Randy,"Do not trust this company to give you a loan. I feel into desperation during the covid lock down and heard good things about them so I thought I would try it. My first mistake. I know owe far more money to them than I can even withdraw. I have made every payment on time and in full, yet it is futile because it all just goes to interest. I am almost positive the only way out of this mess is to file for bankruptcy and hope to god that I can pay off what ever the court decides."
Tamera Perkins,I got injured not job and very understanding my situation
Naisha Tabron ,I COULD NOT FIND ANYMORE EXCELLENT PAY DAY LOAN COMPANY LIKE CASH NET USA BEEN DOING BUSINESS WITH THEM OVER 5 YEARS OR SO  AND NEVER ENCOUNTER ANY PROBLEM WITH THEM EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICEI say Goodbye to them because they will no longer offer this product (Payday Loan) here in California
Dana,He was very kind. Helped me out with my orib
Becca,That was a problem with url Gmail account all good
Tonya,I appreciate but would go again you can help me out of a bun I just need to know when my first payment starts and how do I pay that’s all I need to know can I do take it out of my account every month that would be easier for me but I need to know a date it will be taken out so I can deduct it from my account
Rhoda,"This company has been a nightmare to deal with. This is the definition of Predatory Lending. First, I implore you to never use this, unless it's a life or death situation. Second, read, read, READ, the agreement so you aren't blindsided by the ASTRONOMICAL amount of DAILY interest they will be charging you. Finally, if you plan on paying them off, DO NOT mail them a payoff check. I did a consolidation loan with my back and a fraction of a fraction of the interest rate, and my bank mailed them 2 checks. One to pay off my account, and one my wife's account. 1 month later, neither accounts are paid off. The check for my wife's account was cashed, but NEVER applied to her account. The check for my account was ""lost,"" and never cashed. To investigate anything they require a ton of leg work from you, and then just tell you to wait.... Which will result in you checking in every few days to only be told to wait more. I still have no resolution on either account. I've resubmitted a check for my account with the cancelled check, and still haven't seen any updates. They still can't find my wife's DEPOSTIED PAYMENT!!! AVOID THIS COMPANY LIKE COVID!!!"
Virginia Jacobs,Want to know why company  no longer is loaning  in California
Maria,"The intererest rates are ridiculous, but that is the price you pay when you don't have the best credit and find yourself in an emergency situation.  Plus if you are able to pay more or pay early you greatly reduce the amount of interest you pay. They are however, very up front about the cost so it should never be a surprise.  And the app makes accessing your account and information super easy and if you need money same day as long as you put in your request fairly early you get it the same day.  What I want to brag on in their customer service!  I have always received excellent customer service every time I have reached out with a question or needing assistance over the phone or through the web chat.  Thank you for putting your customers first!"

TONYA,The advisor was very helpful
Karen Maldonado,"CashnetUSA sent me a letter in the mail a few days ago out of it seemed no where saying Ive been pre approved for a long up to 1,000. I was applying for loans close to a year ago so I figured they must had my info and thats why they were able to pre approve me. Anyways I was truly so happy when the letter came because it was the perfect amount i was needing for my family at the time and I knew I was going to be able to pay it off quickly. I went online verified my info and entered my routing and account number. It was doing anything when i hit apply so I called just to find out I was not approved but was actually denied and she wasnt able to tell me why. She said it may be because of the bank I use but why would they send letters lying saying your approved for a certain amount when in reality you might not be. It was a lie and really got my hopes up and was so happy thinking i was going to be able to get what I needed for my family. seriously so depressing really sucks"

Joe,I was told this place approved almost everybody to help build credit so I have tried several times and get denied every time even with the money I make each paid period I was still denied and I currently have no debt. I have one credit card with i pay on monthly never had any issues just never had credit bc nobody will give you credit if you have no credit so either way you go you're stuck. Didnt really need the loan just wanted to build my credit but cant build without having credit.
Julio cesar,I just want to say you guys are awesome if it wasn't for you a few things was going to get turned off and I really appreciate wat you have done for me thank you so much
TANZANIA,"Hello yes my experience was so excellent the person name was Brittney and she explained everything to me,She answered all my questions and then some Thank you so very much for the loan I really really appreciate it.Thanks to y'all I got what I needed done and I will let everybody know!! I love it!"
Garry,"So far it’s been very helpful, now I’m waiting for my deposit."
Tammie Flowers,"Great service!!! Fast, easy, and informative."
Danny,My first experience was very pleasant. I received an offer in the mail and I was afraid at first because when I usually get offers and apply I’m always being denied but that wasn’t the case with CashNetUSA. I went in and applied with my offer and was immediately approved. And the funds were in my account the next day. The reason I’m given 4 stars and not 5 stars is because the only thing I don’t like is the amount that is expected to be paid back it’s kinda expensive but other then that I recommend CashNetUSA to anyone who is in need of extra cash for emergency purposes or you just need the extra cash to help yourself out. My first experience was very exceptional.
Volonda Jones,They will not approve me. First time I was approved but wasn’t told I needed a checking account so I gave my savings account info bc that was an option. Was told loan was still going to go through to my savings account after I noticed it wasn’t deposited the next day like it was suppose to be. Canceled loan and went to get a checking account and since then I’ve been denied denied denied!!!

Vicky Fox,"I asked why I kept getting sent back to my account homepage everytime I tried to refinance my loan. She told me the system wasn't giving her a reason, but that my loan simply couldn't be refinanced at that time. I assume it's either because my most recent payment had not yet cleared or because I'm too close to the final payment. Ms. Toshiba answered my question to the best of her ability with the knowledge she had on hand and I felt she handled the situation rather professionally."

Mansour,"I have been a customer of CashNetUSA 2 to 3 years now, give or take a year. I have never had a issue with anything out of them. They have always met my needs when needed. I will continue to do business with them as long as they keep me as a customer. As long as you make your payments as scheduled there will never be a problem from them. Thanks CashNetUSA for all you do. Much appreciated. R.C."
Marcus Thompson,Easy approval.  Fast delivery of funds. However I would only recommend small loans. Large loans can turn into financial struggles  especially if you need an extension on a large amount. Best suggestion I can make:  don't go over $300 or it can turn into a long payoff with lots of interest.

Leenoy,"Think twice before borrowing. I took out my loan in 2018 because I couldn’t afford rent. It did help me not get evicted, but I’ve been having to borrow because the min payments went up and up. It got to the point where from 01/01/2022 to 06/24/2022, I’ve been charged 3574 dollars in interest at 800/mo. You cannot get ahead with this loan. I was finally able to secure a debt consolidation loan, and my balance finally reads zero, but I have lost so much money, over $400 rent. I’ve been there, and I know why you’re considering borrowing. Just think twice because if you can’t pay it back and you can only make the minimum payments, you’ll never pay off this debt. I learned my lesson the hard way, not saying don’t do it. If I hadn’t, I’d be homeless but just think twice about it. Also, at least when I first borrowed, it started at $500, then it was raised again and again and again until I was at $2500; if you don’t have reasonable impulse control, this is not a loan for you."
Reagan,Awesome customer service!

Barbara,"They claim instant approvals and same-day deposits blah blah blah but in fact they want more information than a home mortgage and after five solid days they still haven’t decided, all this for a few hundred dollars??? This company is a complete joke!!!Update: Their reply is nothing more than an attempt to get readers to think they care… they provided the EXACT same useless phone number that is the only phone number for contact and there’s not even an option to speak with a person to begin with!!! If you do manage to get through using the back door, you just get a random customer service representative that doesn’t know anything about this review and isn’t the least bit concerned about it!!!"

roaring surf,CashNetUSA.com provided ease of access and personal loan advances in short order.  I won’t recommend them for most everyone depending upon their financial needs.  They have very high convenience fees in payment back on Flex Loans.  Once I pay off entire Flex Loan I most likely will not use CashNetUSA.com as any short term lender.  Repayments do not show or reflect on your Credit Scores.
Michael,Helped out when I needed it
Monica,"Professional, polite, helpful, fast easy process."
FREDERICK,"Most helpful and understanding agent, she went out of her way to explain the process to me👍👍"
Denice,"The initial phone call was great. The representative was informative and knowledgeable, and started setting me up with an account for a loan. Then she clearly gave me instructions about getting on line to complete the loan application.  That when I had some issues. First issue was for almost 25 minutes I didn't get a confirmation code that was to be send to me in my email to verify my email and other information. Then I checked of to allow electronic transfers and supplied them with the name of my bank, routing number and account number. What raised RED FLAGS was when I was asked for my banking user name and password.  At that point I got suspicious because I remember when I opened my bank account years ago to never ever give out my banking user name and password. That's like giving someone absolute and complete access to my bank account/money. Of course I did not give them that particular personal information."
KRR,Helpful in assisting customer.

ANSHA,"This has been the best company for payday loans ever. I have really been appreciative of the payday loans they give, with how things are going these days it was super needed. It is very HORRIBLE that they have decided to stop offering these things to Californians anymore. With how expensive it is living here and everything else, this is when this would be needed the most. Not understanding why this was chosen."
Bruce,Great customer service they care about helping you.
SHERRIE COLWELL,"CashNetUSA is an excellent company to go through to obtain a payday account, a flex loan account or anything you need to do.  They are very courteous, polite, welcome to help you in any way you need.  They go beyond the word of helping you out.  It is a very quick way to get whatever type of loan you need.  They are the first company I would use to do what I needed to do,  Excellent company and people."
Matthew,Excellent customer service
CHRISTOPHER,"This company used to be good, I've used them for 10+ years but not any more! They don't care about their customers, not even a teeny tiny bit, wait that's not true they do care about their customers money and finding all ways they can to take it from them instead of help them. They are overly greedy and are literally abandoning all of their loyal long term customers to make more money. At least sell the business and start one doing something different instead of ruining it. Do not use this company EVER, they are now AWFUL and untrustworthy and they will make you regret it. Shame on you Cashnetusa."
LARRY,"CashNet USA has been easy to work with as a team and easy to make the payments on time, since they pull it out on the day of my direct deposit."

DEMON JAMES,They say you have a loan and shows they have approved it without it sowing up in bank account
lsmithssbn,CashNetUsa is the place to go if you need to paid unexpected bill. I would recommand CashNetUsa to everyone that need a loan.
Thomas,"Pro is that they will pre-approve or approve you. No doubt. Con is that the interest is extremely high and it accumulates daily. Every time you think you’re making progress on repaying your loan, you log in and see they have pretty much added so much interest that you’re back to the amount of the first week. My advice to you is go somewhere else where they are honest and doesn’t try to take advantage of you doing a difficult time in life. I definitely would not have applied for a loan from CashNet if I had read the reviews on other sites beforehand."
Dee,I have experienced excellent service with cash eta will advise to others in the future
mary,Excellent service with no hassle and clear communication
Christina,Needed some funds.Went on line to CashNet and the next day my money was in my bank account.Thanks CsshNet!!
George,"Pros they will more than likely approve you for a loan. Cons the interest is extremely high, plus they charge you interest daily. The payments come out whenever your payday is. It's almost like a cash advance company or a title loan place. I was told my minimum payments would be close to 190 for the first month. Then the payments would slowly decrease."
Deloris parke,"The process is simple, the representatives are professional, and you don't have to sit on hold, or answer a million questions to a computer when you call!"

Dorothy,Customer service was prompt and professional.  In these times politeness goes a long way!!!
Calvaneisha lee,They were a great place to borrow money from
Shirley,They didn't even contact me before denying the loan. Never asked any questions. But the ad said no credit check and they ran my credit and used it to make a decision on a payday loan.  But ya'll didn't even ask questions that needed to be answered  to get to a unbiased decision.
Laurie,Even though I ended up paying MORE than the actual money that I borrowed and I mean a LOT more. It came in handy at the time.

Jae,They cashnetusa is a good service for quick access to funds it is not meant to be a long term lending source I do believe they stated that I did not think the interest rate would be so high or the software that the customer service reps use would be hard for them to navigate as far as coming up with suitable payments for their customers but overall the staff is excellent so I would have to repeat about this software that they use to accumulate funds and payment options and if it were my company I would invest in a better software

Marietta,Cash net USA is a reliable loan and trustworthy when you need a loan. They have friendly staff and quick service
Jerry Hawkins,Service was excellent
Jan,"This company is absolutely crap. You NEVER know how much they will take out your account. One payment can be $95 and the next could be $300. Interest rates are outrageously high. Paying $300 only covers about $50 of the principle. They basically say ""hey let me help you right now by giving you a little money but until you pay it all back, we are gonna make surviving hard as hell"" they told me my payments would be $95 then took $330. Then said they can't tell me how much each payment would be.... but why not? Its like a credit card... but I took the full amount it allowed and it said my first payment would be $95.. so shouldn't all my payments be $95 and not $330? Paying off asap. Not a good company to do business with if you can't afford someone just taking what they want from your account."

I wish the lady would've told me how much my rate would've been before I apply I would've never accepted it or recommend anyone else to use this my thing is is I took out a loan fa 1050.00 why does it take a year to repay if your deducting 177.24 out of my account?So I'm like 177.24 ×12 plus 8.60 a day is way more than one thousand fifty dollars what kind of interest rates is this I will never use this again or recommend anyone I'm sorry for using cashnet and recommending my friends to use it this is outrageously expensive and ridiculous

Nathaniel,"One 4/28 I called CASH NET USA and asked if I paid my loan off with my debit card , then can I  get a new loan with instant funding , I was told I could DO THIS , NO PROBLEM. WELL That's NOT WHAT HAPPENED ! The very next day 4/29 I called first thing in the morning and paid off my loan but when I tried to get a new loan an incorrect due date appeared, I was still on the phone with the woman and she tells me you will not be able to do your loan today if you need a different due date . Im like but I was told I could do another loan yesterday with no problem , I asked her can you extend the due date by 2 days please so I can take my loan today it is Friday and I need the instant funding because the weekend is coming and I cant get instant funding on the weekend , she again told me I would have to wait until Monday to reapply for my loan. I called back a couple of hours later to ask if I took my loan on Sunday 5/1, when would I receive funding , well THIS NEW WOMAN SAID I COULD HAVE TAKEN MY LOAN THIS MORNING  , FRIDAY AT THE SAME TIME I CALLED AND DID MY PHONE PAYMENT AND THEY COULD GO IN TO MY ACCOUNT AND ADJUST THE DUE DATE FOR ME MANUALLY , SO THE LADY FROM THIS MORNING  WAS WRONG AND BECAUSE OF HER  IT WAS NOW TO LATE IN THE DAY TO DO MY LOAN WITH INSTANT FUNDING AND THAT SHE WAS SORRY . I told her this whole experience was  so awful and that now I would have an additional $100 fee to one of my bills because I would not able to pay my bill due on 5/1 on time because I was not able to get my loan with instant funding so know my payment will be late because I cant get funding until 5/2 all because I was not given the proper information in the first place . I told her I would like to make a complaint because this was not right Im a good customer and I don't deserve this. SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS FILLING OUT A FORM AND THAT THE MANAGEMENT TAKES THESE ISSUES VERY SERIOUSLY AND A SUPERVISOR WOULD CALL ME BACK FOR SURE ON THE SAME DAY , FRIDAY 4/29. TWO DAYS KNOW AND NO ONE EVER CALLED ME BACK SO THIS IS WHY I LEFT A REVIEW TO LET PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THIS COMPANY DID TO ME AND IM A TO GOOD CUSTOMER! CUSTOMERS DO NOT DESERVE TO BE TREATED LIKE THIS AND THEN JUST IGNORED WHEN THEY TRY TO REACH OUT .          UPDATE,  There is nothing you can do now . A supervisor was supposed to call me a couple of days ago and sort this out and try and help me but no one ever reached out and called me back as promised. It was not a supervisor that responded below, it was only customer service . Anyways, it's a little too late to help me now with the instant need I had  last Friday, unfortunately."
Lisa Jackson,"Don't use this service, they will charge nearly $3000 for a $1000 loan. Even if you try to pay the $1000 off immediately you are still stuck with the nearly $2000 charge just for borrowing the $1000"

The first email I received stated that a starter check could not be used. When I pointed out the fact that it wasn’t a start check just not a standard size check book i received a email stating that they were unable to accept a pre printed check. My checks are not pre printed either. My name, address, routing and account number are the only things printed on my check. It has been such a disappointing experience. Because the checks are larger they are not acceptable??"

No matter how small the draw amount. I mean it’s like financial rape. Please if you have no other option, and I totally get that, be sure that your income is sufficient enough to accept anything from them. Please. I starved myself many days and was nearly kicked out of my apartment a couple of times because of them. It’s not worth it at all honestly. Go with a local payday loan instead. I’m begging you."

Margaret,"So we all know the price of getting an instant loan. The fees suck. We pay them because we have too. That being said, I've found cashnetusa is consistent and reliable. The funds are always deposited quickly. Only once was it the same day though. I trust this company.  I've also never had any problems with them taking out money before they should, or taking out more than is owed.  When I've had issues paying the loans all at once they very quickly and easily allowed me to split up the payments over time. (I think you have to have at least 4 loans or something within a year in order to access this extended payment window.)"

I was first told my application was denied when I never submitted one. Then I it must have been fraud. I was transferred to another rep who told me my application was denied. Then she said no application has ever been filed. I said it was sketchy and unprofessional and she told me I could not take out loans in the future. So I said you ban people for calling out and she said you're not banned have a great day it was my pleasure and disconnected. Multiple people told me not to trust them and I was in a  hard place so I tried big mistake. Steer clear!

Margret,It's nice to have somewhere to come to when u need little extra money if I ever need it!!
Quincy Brisby,"I am giving this company a 1 star because I have steady income from a job I've had for 9 months.

Sarah,"I love CashNetUSA! They saved me when my paycheck was messed up and I was going to be unable to pay my bills until my next paycheck in two weeks. I sat up all night crying because I wasn't sure if my credit score was good enough for a loan or if I would even get enough money or even considered. I was approved right away and they even offered 40$ a month for payments! I don't want to hear about you all complaining about the interest and payment fees. IT'S A LOAN It's not suppose to be given to you ALL THE TIME, they're there to help you when times get rough and you need emergency funding temporarily. Thank you, CashNetUSA for your amazing customer service and helping me when I was in a tight spot!"

Mark,Have been a customer for quite sometimes. CashNetUSA has been very helpful throughout
Sandra Calkins,Been with this company for years never had a problem with them until they owed me money for taking out of my banking account in error. Got an email saying they would be sending me a check by mail in Jan it is now March and I've called them 7x in this regard. They keep telling me a manager will call or email over and over. When I ask to speak to a manager of course there isn't one available. I should make them pay interest on the money they owe me for 2 months. Customer Service reps have a very bad mannerism and needs retraining or moved to a different dept!
Jose Cantu,Cashnet USAis there when you need extra money. The workers are nice.
Ebony,"I was in a Car crash , no work but they are working with me!"

Evetta,"Got great response from the worker courtness,and pleasant."
Lori,This company is horrible! If you know like i know you'll by pass this app!!! They charge you interest daily and its out of this world high!!! They take payments out twice like a interest payment then the actual payment of the loan. Every time they take money out its a different percentage and it's higher. So if you are paying a note  for 120 they will take that plus 8 dollars a day so add 8xhow ever many days in the month and see exactly how they are ripping you off!! Thats why the loan so easy to get! The way this is set up you will never pay this loan off. My daughter borrowed 700.00 and been making payments but they dont reflect on the loan until you pay the interest down to 3 percent so now her loan is 1500. 00 this is a straight rip off. Stay away people stay away!!

Phillip Senter,"Fast professional way to get a loan, give me all my options, very informative"
Tala,Cash net was very easy and took care of my needs thoroughly and quickly
GILBERT,"Getting the loan isn't difficult,  but it tells you when you're eligible for another loan once that one is paid off. They do not honor those dates. When you ask why,  they say that vericheck hasn't cleared you. I can go down the street and vericheck has cleared me the very next day after payment is made. I don't agree with that. Customer service people are wonderful!!"
"Ricky-Lebanon,TN",This company should be closed down till they are educated on how not to take advantage of people...300%interest is totally unheard of..then they take 2 payments out at a time..
Robin,"This company say they only deal with a small amount of bank accounts, i have an online only bank and they won’t help me because of that. Some people can only have that type of account and because of that y’all won’t help, I will definitely not recommend y’all to anyone ever"

Candice,We suddenly had to evacuate for a large hurricane and had no money. We applied while on the road with our children not knowing what we were going to do.

JOSEPH,Truly the easiest was to borrow money because it doesn't take that long to reapply.
Mary,This company is a scam and they take advantage of people.  A loan should have one monthly reasonable payment not 3 monthly high payments.  For almost 3 years. DO NOT DO Business with these crooks
Hollie,"If I could give less then one star I MOST DEFINITELY would!!! This company is the opitomy of a DISHONEST loan shark!!! I sent a cashiers check to pay off my account and first the man on the phone gave me the WRONG address to send the check. I had to call to get the payoff amount. My check was returned to the bank because of the address and my bank said that this it rather customary because it gives them more time to add interest to your account and at 299% yearly that is can be anywhere from a few dollars and up. Mine got up to $15+ a day while waiting for this HORRID company to fix my account...but they STILL want the interest and refuse to fix it. My bank sent the check out a second time to the correct address and CashNet USA cashed my check but then the next month reversed the check off my account but never returned the funds. Also in going over my account VERY CAREFULLY I found MANY discrepencies. There were a few months where they took payment but NEVER posted it to my account or reversed the payment and never returned the monies. On 1/14/21 my year to date interest was $134.70 with $260.42 charged for the month. Then on 2/11/2021 my year to date interest was $1,053.26 with $322.60 charged in interest for the month. I'm not a math teacher but that doesn't add up. I reached out to the company SEVERAL times to fix these issues but to no avail. Finally I gave up...and they stopped harassing me mid 2021. Well a couple months ago I found out that they sent my account to a collection agency for  an unpaid and delinquent account . I had to go back to my bank to get a copy of the cashed cashier's check dated 10/14/2020. I THINK this is finally settled...but the collection agency is not responding to my emails...so who knows. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY...but if circumstances in your life require you to use a cash advance loan shark CAREFULLY and DILIGENTLY go over EVERY statement and transaction!!! THIS COMPANY IS EXTREMELY DISHONEST AND HAS HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE WHEN THEY ARE IN THE WRONG!!!!! BEWARE!!!!!"
Lisa,"Thank you , it was so easy to receive help , and just being able to make payments is so helpful , again thank you very much for being there when I needed you"

I’m grateful that I was able to speak with a person such as himself and he was able to help me out at this time thank you so much Tim keep up the great work.
Sherman,"Today I had the pleasure of working with Ms. Doris, she was an absolute pleasure to work with. She resolved all of my issues. Customer Service like hers, makes me proud to be a customer of cashnet.usa for over 15years!!!Happy Customer ❤"
Nicole,"I love this company, Alway on time easy to use. And very friendly"
Stephen,CashNet is a great place to deal with and I personally am blessed by them today.
Sam,"I was looking to borrow some quick money to solve a problem that has been lingering for almost a year. A friend suggested I try cash net USA , I did and almost immediately I was approved for a loan."
Sharon,"I really don’t appreciate how high the apr is! Completely ridiculous. Instead of being reasonable give those with bad credit a chance at a lower rate. In my opinion most people only want to not pay it off and rip you off due to the fact that they have to pay $3,000 for only $1,000 in the long run if you don’t pay the loan off the next day you’ll be broke. People with bad credit or in my case brand new credit should be given the privilege of getting such a low apr. Most people with fantastic credit scores are only like that because they got money or it took them there whole life( at least that’s what I’ve seen). I’m not rich I’m 18 make little money unless I hit my 60 hour mark. But I’ve got two cars(27,986 and 29,999)three credit cards(Total available credit 750) and never missed a payment in my life, my utilization rate 10%. But I did bring my credit from 300 to 600 in less than 2 months. And yet I’m still stuck with. 23% apr on both my vehicles. Even know I do everything correct make payments on time. So think of yourself as a company do you want to be the ones that people hate and only thrive for the money than be my guest, a company should thrive for helping there economy, for there people, and for there pride. Sure the company I work for is extremely wealthy one of the wealthiest in the world. But they better the economy, on god there for the people, everything I’ve seen the company do even as a whole has been extremely life changing to me and everyone in this world. Even if they don’t see it!"

Hilberta Mcmullen,"Do Not Trust CashNet USA. I received a loan quickly enough.  I asked for only $800, instead they put $1300 in my account.  When I found out, two days later, I immediately paid them back the extra monies that I did not request.  They are now charging interest on the extra $500 after only two days of me “borrowing” the money.  I have sent an e-mail stating my case; they did not respond.   I asked for proof that they resolved this matter as they stated, and asked for a transcript of the recording when I applied, in the E-mail, they did not respond.  I personally don’t know what to do.  Fair Trade Lending Law?  Be Very Careful About This Company!  This is just my opinion!"

TODD,We applied for a loan to get a little help getting Christmas for our children and got denied... We even received a pre-approval offer in the mail so we go through the steps listed on the offer and once again get denied... It's one thing to be denied but it's totally different to get pre-approval emails and offers in the mail just to be denied yet again!!!!  Thanks for the help NOT!!!! POINT BEING DO NOT SEND APPROVAL LETTERS OUT TO STILL DENY FUNDING!!! This would have greatly helped in getting Christmas for 5 kids.... The initial denial didn't bother me.... It was after I got the pre- APPROVAL offer that I thought I would be able to get them a better Christmas.... In other words I was never APPROVED!!!!!
Darlene Flippo,She was good she got the problem fix
Hamilton,CashNetUSA is actually what they say they are! I was approved immediately. It took less then ten minutes. The payments are affordable. I will be referring them and using them for life!
Anthony s,"We're happy with getting the money, but not happy with the amount you have to pay back right away. I expected to pay a couple hundred a month, not 500 to 600 right away. It means not paying other bills, such as electric and gas just so I can pay this one. They know you will need to keep taking the principle out again and that way you pay more in interest. It's like a never ending cycle."
Gail,They really came thru when I needed the help

SHAWNA,CashNet is a scam! They seek out people in need and get you with the hidden interest rates! I only took out a $1000 loan there is no reason I should be paying this company back over $3000. Payments are taken biweekly and as soon as your check deposits into your account. I’ve paid back the loan and then some! I will be closing my account/stopping payment to lock them out! It’s ridiculous. You basically NEVER PAY THE LOAN OFF. You will be trapped into a vicious cycle! DO NOT TAKE A LOAN FROM THIS COMPANY…. NO MATTER HOW DESPERATE YOU ARE!!!! DO NOT MAKE MY MISTAKE…
Will A.,"This is my second loan with CashNetUSA. I must say the money is received easy,  But I must say the interest is very high.  I tried to this time to see if I could not have such a high interest rate since I did pay off my first loan.  I just paid on my new loan with almost a 100% interest rate, with that being said, It will take a long time to even get the balance where it can be paid off. This was the problem before.  The help is very welcome. I just do not see why they choose to apply such a high rate. Louisiana is in a health crisis. This company is a good financial platform. Please help people! not make them regret getting a loan from CashNetUSA."

Christopher,They have been awesome to work with. Very simple process.
Kim,Excellent service.
Anna,I mean a co-worker told me about this company and I was skeptical but it’s legitimately a good idea and investment .. I need the cash and they gave it to me!!! As long as you enter all your correct banking information and verification your all set !!! Highly recommended 1-2-22 update the interest rate is high as hell they started charging me interest before my due date was actually due the interest rate is so high you’ll never pay them off if or when you have planned too… For example: I got 750. Interest or fees charged or $112.50 totally 862.50 now on 1-2-22 I owe 966.88 and they told me interest occurred daily I forgot my interest rate that’s why I didn’t put it in the comments but it’s good if you need it but if you don’t stay away from it because now I’m stuck with trying to get this pay so I can get off my credit report if it ever get there avoid it happy new year everyone!🎆🎉😍😊 first payment wasn’t until January 10th 2022 ……110.65 and Payments also get applied to the interest before you get paid to the principal this 💩 real They’ll give you the money but is it really worth it and I’m saying this from personal experience.
Abigail,I don't understand how my ex was allowed to use my information to get a loan and now I am stuck with paying it off

Very professional and caring at the same time as to make me feel uneasy.
Nikia,"This loan company charges too much interest, it is ridiculous. It is explained in the contract, however, it is still outrageous.

Albert,"I applied for a very small loan, I am a Grandma raising my Grandchildren. On the application they asked how often I was paid , honestly 2x a month I'm on disability where I receive $700.00 a month. I also receive an additional income for my Grandchildren from Job And Family services of $442.00 there really wasn't a spot for the information but tried to include as assurance I could repay the loan. I feel absolutely humiliated and embarrassed as I've never been the type to ask for anything. My babies have had a rough year we've each had Çovid at separate time's. My husband fought and was injured for this Country, yet it seems This Country has never fought for us. I was trying to do something for them at Xmas because right now we're all they have that care. I've had custody of them for 6 years and although it's a struggle at times ,I'm so Blessed to have them. My granddaughter is in the National Honor Society at Western Hills High school she'll graduate with Honors, therefore I'll never have to worry about a company treating her like she doesn't matter. CreditNetUSA enjoy your XMas."

They responded to my e-Mails and my skepticism professionally and considerately and I was sold and followed through with loan. I was no longer confused and/or unsure. WARNING ⚠️ I beg of you please beware of the outrageous monthly payments you may end it with paying more in interest than loan was. If what the calculations were after I received monies, I am being required to pay back close to 5 or 6 thousand dollars for 2,000 dollars with payments all over the place monthly from over 400 to 700 dollars monthly for $2,000.00"

So I m asking about that over I recommend them. Good credit or paid they approve you. so i guess if you don't get approved before one then expect your funds tomorrow. why is it hard to contact customer services though? I trying calling you guys and on a hold for a long time. over  five star.

MARY,"CashNet instantly approved me for a small loan, but when I attempted to ""Continue to Application* I was asked for a user name and password. I did not recall ever having created a password with Cashnet, so I went with a standard password. I could not login, and trying ""Forgot your password? only resulted in a promise to email mre a link to create a new one. The email with the link never came.Most ""forgot password? links I have ever tried sent me the email within 5 minutes. Yours said it might take 2 days. No deal, so I went with another company."

Thomas,I started out getting payday loans after a couple of times of paying those back I was offered a line of credit to where I could draw up to a certain amount and make payments towards the line of credit. Fees and interest are a bit high but that’s expected with any payday loan company. I’ve been through a bankruptcy and all and these people still gave me a chance. Definitely would recommend them to anyone they’re legit professional and they help people with less than perfect credit.

I dreaded calling customer service because of the usual experiences that I have had from other companies. She understood what I was asking for, very clearly articulated what she was going to do about it, and also asked me if she could go ahead and place an order for me since she was already in my account.

And the amount I qualified for was immediately deposited into my checking account without incident. I look forward to doing business with them, and I would highly recommend their service(s) to everyone."
Gerry,"I have used this service twice as an emergency between paychecks. The first time I received the money within a couple hours. The 2nd time it took 20 hrs for them to send the money. My emergency had come and gone in the time I got the money so I was left short and scrounging to pay my home emergency repair work. I requested the draw in the evening and was expecting the money by morning time and it didn’t come through until about 3:30 in afternoon. It’s also imperative you pay these back quickly or interest will eat you alive. I guess what I’m saying is if you need money extremely quickly, you can’t really count on this."

Aleta,"My customer service rep Jenessa was very professional, she asked what could she do for me and that she will see what she can do and they problem was solved. She was concerned about the customer and my well being."
DEREK,Make sure you also record their calls as well! The amount of misinformation these people gave me every time I called was ridiculous. After calling to move a payment and then asking the service rep three times if I wouldn’t have a payment they said no all three times. Now the day comes when I’m NOT supposed to be be charged and CashNetUSA is taking money out of my bank I had no idea about. Call them about this and this time they say that I couldn’t move this payment and they’re not sure why the last representative said that. But they’ll still take your money even if it’s a communication or negligence issue on their part. Also don’t just pay your minimum amount you’ll only being paying on your interest only. Only use CashNetUSA if it’s your absolute only option trust me I know it sucks but beg your family and friends first before using them.
Jerry,"Cashnet USA is awesome, and I love the discounts they offer. I will most definately refer them to friends and family."
Catrisa,"Fast, friendly, and honest and very helpful!! I recommend them to anyone!!"

Izile,"I have done loans with this company a couple times went well.!I advise no one to do a loan with them over $500. If you do there is misleading information on your payments. I never miss a payment and pay on time and even pay more then what my payments is. You will never see your payment decrease.one minute it low then next minute it high. The representative are very rude, After I’m done with this I will never do business with this company.and I will let others know to don’t do business with this company. and if I got to advertise it on social media’s I will do so, and will also report to BBB"

BEN,When I applied they didn’t show how much my monthly payment be
Kellie,They always are easy to work with and quick with their payout
Judy,Although they provide cash for those who have challenged credit I believe they could do more to retain long term customers. Once customer has good history reward them with lower interest to keep them long-term. Once they have their hooks in you the interest which is extremely high you can't pay it off. So my opinion cashnetusa takes advantage of those in tough spot. Simply greed no way around it. Care about customers before you lose them.
JUAN,Excellent quick service

sheila armond,"I have been doing business with CashNetUSA on and off  for quite a few years but have never even talked to an employee there. You can do everything you need to do online. Including your very first loan request and submitting your proofs if any are needed. I have used them to cover the cost of an unexpected vehicle breakdown, to just a little extra cash for that fun weekend you've been invited to.  I am very busy so not having to wait on hold for a customer service representative is wonderful.  And just being able to go online and within minutes have my loan request submitted, approved and then funded as soon as the same day. To me those are a couple of the things that make a great company."

Bobbie Hazelton,Don't do it it's a trap . Say u can opt out but no u cant sh#t so dam dumb .
SHARON COLE,"Fake 5 Star Reviews. 95% of these are fake. They are VERY short or what you'd expect from a mass payed rating company. They literally copy and paste their 5 star Reviews. If you get a $2k loan, expect to pay $800 A MONTH. Just a MONTH. That's before your principal payment. Good luck going bankrupt over $2,000."
Chrissy,Fast & easy transaction.  They provided a service exactly as advertised.
Tawona,"So CashNet was very great in the process of allowing me to receive the $2,000 line of credit even with bad credit, so I applaud them on that factor of trust as a consumer. Yes I do understand it was a 2-300% interest of line of credit, but the daily rate charge of $16 for my first billing cycle is just insane. Yes I understand that the interest rate is what it is and due to the loan amount. But at minimum payment of an expected 2 and a half years would have totaled about $12,000 on a $2,000 line of credit. That's ridiculous and better off with a personal loan on a 12 month payment plan. The customer service was more than great trying to answer my understanding of the current pay off amount. Customer service isn't the issue, but the interest rate of the business, (yes I agreed upon) compounded within the first month was just too much. In total, for a $2,000 line of credit I had withdrawn at max in to my account mid August, I paid a total off $2,791. (09/14/2021)…$800 of total fees and APR within the first month. Sure you could pay off more, but that compounded APR DAILY is what gets you. I advise to just get a payday loan, even at $2,000...8 pay day loans paid off after a month would have only been $400. without transfer fees. That's a lot of loans, but even if you only needed say $750. its more reasonable to get a pay day loan than paying $350-250 for 24 months. 3 stars for the great customer service, -2 for the compounded interest. Just get a personal loan or payday loan. Oh and I tried to ask how to close my account on the site Chat with ""Britney"" she gave misleading information. I asked how and she said you can't and the account closes after 7 years of inactivity. I asked ""so you CANNOT close my account after I've paid off the total balance? She said NO.  This is False. After your last payment clears and you're at zero balance owed, you simply call TO CLOSE the account (takes 2-3 business days). Your INFORMATION stays with the company for 7 years. You can close your account after you've paid your total amount."
Chelsie,They are always there when I need them fantastic company
Doris Johnson,Dale helped me very well. Solved my problem. Accommodated me and my question Thank you Dale
Monique,Excellent service and I got my money quickly. Thank you!
Raymond,"I have to say I don't like borrowing money from sites like these, but after carefully exploring, CashNet made it easy and saved me from some situation.  The every other weekly payments is hard, but I'm grateful for the help"
Henry,You all were great fast accurate and very helpful thank you for your help
Krystopher,I am Grateful for the help but I do not know why my Account is saying outstanding balance of the same amount I got in the first place when I have made 3 on time payment's and yet it is saying outstanding balance for the Amount I got from the beginning it makes no sense it's like I'm paying back 3× the amount back and if that's the case I won't be getting anymore money from y'all and will not tell people to go to y'all not when you take WAY MORE than what you give... Very Very Disappointed....😔😔

Rosalea,"I was looking to receive the money on yesterday, but it had to be on a day during the week to receive it the next day."
kathryn davenport,"Customer service was great. I was filling out online for a pre-approved line of credit. I got to the end and couldn’t find what the payment was going to be monthly and on $900 my first payment in Oct would have been over $400, and the next month around $367. This outrageously high. It’s like going into a check cashing place and paying your check off and having to keep taking the money again. You would never stop having to pay them and I just can’t pay this kind of money out like this, I was looking for some help and didn’t mind a reasonable payment plan like any normal line of credit but this cycle would have to be an ongoing thing. I may have needed some money but I’m not stupid to dig this kinda hole for life."

CHRISHUNDA,the woman i worked with was amazing best customer service. 5 star hands down wish I could give more!!
Sonia,"I felt like Cashnet rescued me when I was having an issue with my unemployment not being funded for three months. CashNetUSA made funds available to me within 24 hours so that I could pay some bills preventing cut-off on my accounts. When I didn't have funds available to pay my first payment on the loan, they worked really well with me and made me feel that they understood and were willing to work with me so that I could make my payments."
Brian,I called customer service because; i notice something was wrong on my application.. She was so pleasant and nice... She answered and handle the situation without any problem
Veronica,This is a company that takes advantage of people in need of money.  There was no explanation on the outragious finance charges and how they schedule the payments.  I don't think they even checked my credit but just approved me for $1200.  If you don't make biweekly payments then interest rate is over 300%.  I don't know how I will pay all this back..  I just discovered that it will take 18 months to pay back $1200 at a rate of $250 to $365 a month to pay back..
Jackie,Fast. Friendly. Efficient.
William,I like because it was easy to do the aplication .
DONNA,My Mother is Dead!!!! Yes I own a business but I need money to bury my damn mother who died of covid last week.. I applied for a loan thinking the website was for real with the same day check.. That’s a lie… i was told I’d get an email I never got one they said check spam and it was there so I submitted my he information they needed and still no answer. I own 2 business small businesses and I don’t have paychecks stubs I sent in Every piece of information they needed and here we are 3days later and I still don’t have an approval or denial. But they have all my information and I have no money this is scam
Michael,Cash Net has very caring and efficient customer service personnel.  I will always recommend this company to anyone who needs financial help.
Alex,"Cashnet has been extremely helpful in my time of need. There was no hassle, they listened and immediately proceeded to solve my issue. I woulld 100 percent  recommend them"
Deline,Great experience no hassle and the process was so easy. Highly recommended and definitely will use again if need be. A company that truly there to help people in a pinch. Will definitely let friends and family know about cashnetusa.
William,Got me a credit line when I requested it efficiently and effectively. Only gave four stars because they don't report my payments to the credit bureaus. They don't let you know in advance what your payment is going to be on the app. It's a very aggressive interest loan but it serves it's purpose. I drew $700.00 and the interest was $118.00 for thirty days. Not recommended for long term payments.

Lashaundra,Makes easy for when you are in a bind just on the repayment of it that they weren't so high every two weeks.  But really like how quick they get it to you .
Edith,Unfortunately I don't think they are quite as they seem. Tried them when had offers several other places due to their ads of ease and speed. Not quite the case. Still waiting for an email that was to be sent momentarily. We endured some hurricane damage and needed something fast and were let down by their ads. May want to have back up plan if you have a real need or emergency.I have contacted the number and they could not help. The email showed up days later. Stating basically I had no credit which was the purpose of making a small loan. Anyway the reply is nice but the facts are calling got no answers and was told come back in 30 days? I'll pass. I'm a customer and without us you dont have a business. Most places forget that as they grow. That is unfortunate. Thank you for the computer generated report but not exactly customer service.
David,They're  great people they really care about your situation.That  means a lot.Anna
Tina,The only real issues I have is when is my first payment due and how much.

Alyce Holland,Just a beautiful person and thanks to cash net USA  God Bless
Marco,"The customer service has been fantastic overall. I have had to submit  my loan application 3 times, including uploading my paystub. The only emails I have received are to re-sign my application and to resubmit my paystub. I understand the signing and approval need to be done in the same day. When I submit my application at 11am on the second day and the offices don't close until 8pm, one would expect it could be approved in that timeframe. Instead, I received yet another email that my application had been withdrawn.Edit: I have now finally received the approval that my loan will be processed.Edit again: it is now Monday. I started this process on Wednesday. My application was once again withdrawn and had to be resubmitted. The only reason for a second star is the customer service agents are really nice and professional."

Nor do they tell you that your payment amounts will be different every other week. How in the H*LL are people suppose to pay bills when there is no set payment amount?!!!!  NEVER again will I use their services!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

I ask why and he said my Bank would not accept an withdrawal of this kind, and I told him no Thank you and called your company and ask them if I was approved for a loan and Jaclyn told me that she had no record of a loan approval and said it was a scam and sent me ways to prevent it from happening again."

Jenifer White Campbell,Im only giving two stars because they are great at providing a fast loan. The fact that you can borrow when ever you need is great and convenient! The reason I can't give more stars is because the interest on the loan they give you will be out of this world! I tried multiple times to pay this loan off by paying in huge amounts to no avail. Loan has a ridiculous amount of interest !!!

The reason I can't give more stars is because the interest on the loan they give you will be out of this world! I tried multiple times to pay this loan off by paying in huge amounts to no avail. Loan has a ridiculous amount of interest in only one day. Interest to high consider another option.

Theresa Darling Johnson,Very good in helpful in friendly environment
CHARLENE,Great virtual help! Wonderful company!
MARLON,"Was thankful to receive a loan when no one else would extend credit. However, that comes at a price. With a 299% interest rate, it is nearly impossible to pay down quickly; the interest alone made up the majority of my bi-weekly payment. The website is nearly useless, you can't skip a payment or request a payoff there. They say that they were helping people during the pandemic, but I didn't see it. If you skipped a payment, the interest still accrued, and in two weeks, you now have two payments due. If you want to postpone the second one, you have to use their inefficient phone system. Glad that the regulations in Virginia prevents them from doing further business there."
SABRINA,"No different than the other one companies that say 99% approval rate, if y'all have helped 3 million people with your financial services, how many applications have you received in total? I only ask because I know a handful of people that have been denied! I'd bet that 99% could be more like 75% and false advertisment!!!"
Charles,Thanks great job. It was a pleasure working with you.
Alicia,Excellent ServiceHighly recommended
JANET,Very easy to work with I am very grateful they came through when I was in a jam.
Larry,The process was simple and easy I got the help I needed

Shenita,"My name is Joseph I believe it was on a Saturday night when I came across the cash Net USA app. I recently had a accident in my truck I needed $1,100 immediately which I am $100 still short there were other apps to give immediately Never follow through so I filled out the application on a Saturday night I get $1,155 a month disability what's a small handyman Construction I still got all the information and I was approved far $1,000 loan. I didn't exactly knew how it works so I went ahead and took a $200 draw put down on my truck in auto body shop the money was they are in my checking account by 2 p.m. Monday afternoon I needed some information call the loan interest and when my first payment would be I called the 1-800 number the lady was very courteous very self-explanatory and very thorough I would definitely recommend this company to anyone that shows a decent income thank you Cash Net USA. Now all I have to do is wait till the end of the month to get my other $100 for my disability check to get my truck another 3 weeks I sure wish I would have been approved for$ 11 0 0.oo but I'm grateful for what I got"
Joseph,You have picked me up when I was at the bottom. You have given me an opportunity to fix my live. Forever grateful
Olive ,Today I was offered a loan that seemed to be too good. So I chatted with a representative of CashNetUSA who was able to confirm the loan offer wasn't from their company but instead from Criminal's who were trying to getg my personal information. Thank you for answering my question and keeping me from the hell that comes with having your identity stolen liewhat happened to me last year.
Sandra Mims,It was  a good filing to talk to someone who had the knowledge  to help me
MARVA,"Fantastic customer service, but website was useless in figuring a payment amount before you request a loan. They were quick to fix my problem and I am a new client but i am very impressed.  of course, you will pay for the money an extremely high interest rate, but customer service was very helpful in helping me choose an amount i can afford"
Thomas,I am very pleased with the promptness and ease of the process.
NaQuandra,"BEWARE:I don't understand why this ""company"" has such high reviews.1.They do not list a brick and mortar address anywhere on their page (big red flag)2. It is impossible to reach a live person on their posted number of 888-801-90753. If you go on the chat ""someone"" will ask you a lot of questions but not answer yours4. When pressed on chat to provide a phone# where I could reach a LIVE person, I was given 877-268-7788, which is all over the internet as nuisance caller and FRAUD!STAY AWAY...FAR FAR AWAY!"

Misty,"I applied for a loan and got approved, but the money didn't get deposited into my account. It went to a different bank that I've never dealt with before. All my information was save to this site and for some reason the router numbers were changed. So frustrating, and I really needed the money.  I called to try and clear the matter, but I have to do extra stuff in order to receive the loan. I don't have checks, nor do I keep my bank statements lying around.

Jacky,Cash Net USA is a great company! I will tell all my friends and family about how good of a company you are!!!
Michelle T,"I have had my Cashnet account for almost 3 years (each time I use it, I pay it back within 2 months). I love this company because they are quick to deposit money (same day if requested by 10am), there is no pre-payment penalty, and they don't report to the credit bureaus (unlike credit cards) so an emergency won't drive up your utilization and tank your credit. Their customer service is exceptional! Any time I have called in, the agent has been, kind, friendly, and helpful. A word of warning though. This is NOT a long term solution because the interest is very high. This is more of a stopgap between paychecks tool. Never borrow more than you can comfortably pay back in a month or two!! I do have to say though that their fees are very transparent (costly, but transparent lol) and that if you understand what you are getting into, this loan product can be a life saver!"
Annette,I am really thankful. CashnetUSA  can loan  get loan for my needs I can pay back  you give me second chance to reapplying to loan you offer 500$Perlita C. Stuart
Jacqueline,"Very satisfied,at happy with the lady I spoken too, helpful and very understanding"
adriana,"They said you could set up a partial payment if you weren't sure you would be able to pay in full by the due date, but they still automatically withdrew the whole amount on the due date, even though a partial payment was set up. They are clearly out for their own funds and not out to help others."

STACEY,"Quick, efficient service and clear guidelines detailed in contract."
Earnest Miller,Contract not explained there would be two payments per month. On application it asked for monthly income and how many times paid per month but does not take into account if paid the same each time. My one income is a small pension and my other is my social security. They never asked the amount of each pay but when payments come due they want two large payments at each pay day.     Be careful when you sign the contract it can be misleading. They have been helpful in all other matters.

shem,great job just wish it was more
Cheri,"Like the fact that they're there for a quick solution, but what draws me back is the fact that with every deduction of the APR; the monthly payments go up excessively.  So it really doesn't make any difference if the APR goes down 10% with every sixth payment; if the monthly payment goes up by the same percentage."

JEFFREY,Only thing was after putting my social security #in.i got a scam call from someone  pretending to be social security saying my #being used illegally When I tried call #back the guy answered wasn't social security.

KARL,"I applied for a loan. I am on Ssdi and i get SS for my deceased husband. I also receive 2 small pension checks. I applied 7/12/21. Sent them like 5 screenshots of all the direct deposits. They said my loan was approved. Later in the day they stated they needed something showing that the payments were recurring. I went to the deposit section of my bank and sent several screenshots of all the deposits.  Then i get an email stating it was withdrawn and to fill out the application again. So i do. I sent them a benefit letter for each Social Security direct deposit, and like 8 different screenshots showing those deposits and the direct deposits of each of the pensions. I kept checking today, the 13th. They send me an email once again saying it was withdrawn and to fill out the application again and send a copy of my most recent paystub. Hello? I dont get a paystub. I needed this loan desperately but not at the loss of my sanity. They are impossible!"

KAREN D ADAMS,Can't understand why I was declined after I was approved
James,"Cash Net USA sends me a quick review after talking to an agent. I gave them a five star review and then I was let down by Cash Net USA for wiring my loan funds to the wrong, non-existent account. I owe $300 as of today but the funds that were supposed to come into my account was sent out to the wrong account. I am a hotel front desk agent, and what Cash Net USA did was equivalent of me checking a guest into an occupied room. One mistake that is supposed to never be tolerated was made by Cash Net USA. I will no longer do business with Cash Net USA. I do business with a few other payday advance agencies, and none of them have ever sent me money, and ended up funding the wrong account. I wonder what kind of system Cash Net USA uses but there must be quite a lot of holes in their operation."
Alonzo,The phone person was great.  The company read your paper work very carefully to prpotect yourselfSo at the bottom they want my real feels it says:The top folks must make grat money and I beleive the old saying them that has money makes money.

Eric L Turman,"Handled my questions very fast and they helped me with my problem. Now I can breathe easier because she handled my account with expertise and with something I can live with. She also answered a question about an email I received using their name. It looks suspicious because I've never heard that CashNetUSA gave out large installment loans.

Crystal,"*BEWARE*I was in the process of applying for a loan but the man on the other end of the phone had a strong accent and very hard to understand really made me jump through many fire hoops trying to get my loan in motion, and after dealing with this guy for at least 2+ hours stressing me out so bad only for him to rudely hang up on me. When i tried calling him back I got a message that said the number is no longer in service. So in conclusion...I gave this guy ALL my personal info that in the end I didnt get a loan (that i was approved for) and was left in a state of anger and confusion. Sincerely,A pissed off person!!I would NEVER recommend this so called company to anyone!! *BEWARE*"

Geraldine Allen,Great company to apply with they take their time to get you what you need and they’re really nice
Jerry,"Well, after filling up their application online,  got approved for a $200 cash advance and signed loan documents as well.  They backed up and told me that they can't use unemployment benefits as income. I explained the agent about starting my own thing from home after certification with Arise.  This week started doing doordash and Papa as an extra income as well. He still denied it and told me that i can apply again after working 30 days with an employer.  i told him that after working 30 days with an employer i certainly know where not to go :) and that i don't have employers i am my employer.  Please if you can choose another place to get your funds from, do it. I really thought this pandemic would teach us all a lesson but it seems some learned and some just got worse.  (Agent Name Gary)"

Constance,"Ms. JULIIA WAS PROFESSIONAL AND VERY EFFICIENT AND KNOWLEDGABLE . SHE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS DOING. SHE WAS KIND. VERY PLEASANT TO SPEAK WITH DURING THIS PANDEMIC SEASON. THE ECONOMY IS UP & DOWN. SOME OF US NEED EXTRA HELP. HOWEVER, WHATEVER THE PROBLEM IS WITH CLIENTS APPLYING FOR A DIFFERENT AMOUNT THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR IN TEXAS AND CAN'T RECEIVE NEEDS TOO BE FIXED. I HAVE CALLED IN ABOUT THIS ON 3 SEPARATE OCCASIONS. THERE HAS BEEN NO ACTIVE OR REAL EFFORT BY CASHNET USA TO RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM. I HAVE BEEN A CLIENT FOR YEARS. SO WHY SEND LITERATURE SAYING I AM ELIGIBLE FOR SOMETHING YET YOU TRY TO PACIFY ME  BY MAKING SOME LAME EXCUSE AND FORCE  ME TO ACCEPT THE LESSER AMOUNT WHILE CLAIMING THE PROBLEM IS BEING FORWARDED TO TECHNICAL SUPPORT. I AM GOING TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER AND REPORT THIS ISSUE TO SOMEONE WHO WILL GET TO THE GIST OF THE PROBLEM. WHY PUT IT OUT THERE AND HAVE NO INTENTION ON DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT? IT IS UNFAIR. IT DOES NOT GIVE ME THE SAME RIGHTS, PRIVELEGES AS OTHER CLIENTS. I HAVE BEEN LOYAL TO THIS COMPANY. I HAVE PAID BACK THE EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF INTEREST RATE EVERYTIME..SO,WHEN IS THE COMPANY GOING TO LIVE UP TO THE GOALS AND MISSION STATEMENT IT IS ADVERTISING TO THE CONSUMER? EVERYONE SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO BORROW  WHAT THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR IRREGARDLESS OF WHAT INCOME BRACKET THEY MAY HAPPEN TO BE IN AT THE TIME. WE ARE STILL IN A PANDEMIC. YOU CAN STILL CATCH THE VIRUS. PEOPLE STILL DON'T HAVE JOBS. FOR SOME CASH NET USA MAY BE THE ONLY BEACON OF HOPE THEY CAN DEPEND ON TO HELP THEM."

Kurue,I can always count on them for quick service I don’t think the state of Texas regulates interest rates in the interest of their citizens by allowing Pay Day loans companies to charge 10 times what is charged in California but that’s our fault for letting them treat us like cattle rather than citizens.  Businesses will do what the market will bear and  TX government will never protect its citizens from the market.
Sheila,Cash net has.no one to call to resolve problems.When u have been with a company for years like I have cash net there should not be any problems like I have had with them this month.Good customers should be appreciated and not given a run around like they have done me.No one I have talked to could tell me anything.For 2 weeks Iv been trying to find out how to resolve this problem.Finally got Jordan who was at least able to tell me I needed to write a physical letter and mail it.Why couldn't one of your reps have told me that to begin with?

Other companies that I have dealt with in the past have not been forthcoming with all the repayment schedules, hidden fees and interest rates. CashNetUSA actually broke that information down before I signed the contract and have been easy to work with throughout this process.

Demetrice,Not helpful at all.   How much time have I spent here after being told i was approved to make it all the way to the final screen and without hesitation said I wasn't.  Why have me spend all that time there?  Was it to collect payment methods from me with NO way to delete them now? You don't need that info.  It needs to be deleted because Im 99% sure your site security is a joke. Not to mention the 1000 email I now have saying my funds are ready.  They are a joke. Lies besides the all look like different companies but nope  all link back to one.  At least unsubscribing (if it really works) from one take them all out.
VAGEENA,Good to use for me
Shirley,I’m new and had concerns about my funding and the adgent was very quick and informative about it...
Timothy,Willing to work with me. Thanks so much.

Now we are waiting on the approval process to be completed and I feel strongly that CashNet USA will be pulling us out of our short term  financial black hole.                                                            -Mark R.

Damien,Had no problems with applying and the funds were in my bank account before I even woke up the next morning!
Helen Tatman,I absolutely love this company. Because of their service I was able to keep my small business afloat through the worst of the covid pandemic. Every time I have spoken with someone they have been extremely helpful and very professional. I would recommend anyone with a small business to use this CashNetUSA. Not every day goes as planned and sometimes you have something happen where you need just a little boost to get by or have the need to have a bit more cash on hand. For example if one of my suppliers runs a special and I need a few hundred I can have it in my bank the next day to take advantage of the offer. I travel a lot. If I needed a set of tires and am a little tight on cash - bang it's there the next day. Depending on the time of day it can be there by end of that business day.
Robert,Always prompt with putting  money in my account
Sherrie Watson,Short and sweet. Approved within minutes. Money received very next day!

Kim Oakes Carnes,"Fast, easy approval process. Cash in my account the next day."
Andrea,"Cashnet was there when I needed to pay the rent but didn't have the money to do so. The application process was easy. If I needed to change a payment that was easy too. The down side is you don't have a fixed payment. It changes every month depending on your balance. You have to double check when changing your due date, that it doesn't cause you to have two payments the 1st month. The interest rate is high. Those are the only downsides. The customer service is very friendly & knowledgeable. It's easy to draw from funds available."
Lego Tha don,The representative was a great help to me and very nice 😊.
Brittany,Very Quick and effective
Judy,No problem getting approved and friendly service
Norman,Fast. Easy. Verification process was a breeze. Easy to navigate the site and the terms were very fair. Definitely will return if I need some extra cash in a hurry!
Sandra Gray,I have been a customer of CashNetUSA for years.  I rarely leave a review but I am so grateful to this company for years of excellent service. When I first came to CashNetUSA I had no credit and it was right after Hurricane Ike. I applied for a payday loan to help replace the food etc that I lost in the disaster once our power came back up.  I didn't think I would get approved as I had no credit at all. They approved me and it was a lifesaver.  I have been a loyal customer ever since and they have been there through emergencies etc and now I have my first credit card in 25 years. If you find yourself in a bind and have no where to turn do yourself a favor and reach out to them.  Borrow what you can afford to pay back and pay your loan off and they will be loyal to you and there when you need them.  Everyone needs help every now and then.  I am so very thankful CashNetUSA was there when I needed them especially being on a fixed income.  THANK YOU CNU!!!

For past 6 months they have taken nearly half my social security check every month despite me telling them that I do not have any account with them.  I stop payment with my bank but CashNet USA just resubmits the ACH Debit under another name.  They are depriving me of the money I need to eat.  I am going without food because of CashNet USA.  I am 81 years old, I can't go back to work!  Someone Please Help!"

SHARONDA,Your interest are to high.Your payments are to high.To many payments a month at a very high payment amount.The length of time to pay off a little amount is to long due to the interest being to high.

James,"I have been a loyal paying customer for a long time and never missed a payment.  For some reason for the last two payments, they have not given me credit for the rate reducer.  Meaning 5/6 next payment 6/6 and then 10% reduced off interest.  The rate reducer has not changed for two months staying at 5/6. I have tried my best to resolve the issue by chat and the company seems not to care.I pay 680 a month for a 2500 loan and have never been late.  Yes, I realize the crazy interest, but I am in a trap and doing my best to pay it off on top of the interest."
Valerie,This was helpful & she was very knowledgeable....
Cecil Rash,Everyone that contacted me was when either way give me the help that I needed even though it is not completed yet we’re still working on it with other client first I can understand that

Joel,CashNetUSA was so easy and efficient to get a loan I would recommend down to everyone
Mary,"(06/21/2021)UPDATE: So I made a payment of $130 on my account and my payment amount wasn’t close to the amount I paid.  I contacted CASHNETUSA customer service to update my banking info so that payments wouldn’t fail and when I get into a chat a rep named “ALEX” was very unprofessional after I reached out to them after making a payment he/she insisted on telling me this is an attempt to collect a debt... I still have credit to draw from and Alex may need some very extensive training as this type of behavior or service will run away consumers that intend to pay their debts.  Not only this, if my account is in good standing and I have a LOC to draw from why are you throwing debt collection in my face.  This is a result of poor training and not only this your agent ended the chat not caring about what I had to say. I recently got approved for my SBA loan and I will be giving the $1000 back that I borrowed. It’s not worth keeping a line of credit.  Hey All! Small business owner here who never expected to have to take out a loan after so many lucrative years as a stylist and small business accountant. Still awaiting the SBA I swallowed my pride and applied with cashnetusa because my credit score is only around 644. The app process was quick and easy and was approved in literally 20 minutes for a line of credit.  Thank you so much CashNet, you were literally a safety net for me and my family, you will never know how much you’ve helped me and my business."
Doreen Higgins,"I can not believe the amount of positive reviews for cash net. First of all, before I go on my rant I will say I haven’t found myself in a payment bind nor have I had any experience working with their customer service team. My review is strictly off of the 275.85% yearly APR, and In addition multiple other daily fees. If you are in a life and death situation I’d say go for it (bc how worst can it get), but you are literally paying whole car note payments . Most of your bi weekly payment is interest. I was initially paying 4-500 dollars monthly on $1,600 loan with barely no movement in the loan going down. Now I owe $1100(paid extra on one of the payments ) which is $330/monthly payment. So I’ll be doing what I didn’t want to do and pull out of my 401K to pay this off this loan this week because this loan will never get paid off. you would literally have to pay twice the monthly amount to see any difference.Please listen and stay away. This is an expensive trap that you will kick yourself in the leg for later. I’m thankful my credit situation has turned itself around. 🙏🏾"
Channy,"Even though I ended up paying more in the long run, CashNet was there to help me when I needed it most. During the craziness of 2020, they were super flexible and worked with me. Can't thank them enough. Without the help, we may have ended up homeless!"
Candace,Great Service and Straight to The point. Thx A Million
Lauren,"I've been with Cashnet USA for about 2yrs, it has assisted me with monetary needs. When paying it off, I was provided a comfortable payment schedule."
Dedrick,this website is making me feel like they are trying to scam me and take my money because i was pre approved for 1000 then when finishing my application and after sending my bank info now i cant get what they already said i was approved for. now im uset highly and may have to close my account.
Diana Lee,"Great  customer service,very  knowledgeable,,patient and helpful"

Randy,Great and fast experience money was day icky after being approve I’m just a young black man trying to establish good credit great job CashNet
Cathy Rousan,I was offered a discount code in my email.  Upon application of the loan the cash net system did not allow me use the discount code.  In a chat with a representative I was informed it could be because I reached the limit of times allowed to use the code.  I was told  after the loan is funded then I am to contact them again to find out if it’s applicable.  My point is why offer it in the first place if it cannot be used.
Ashley,Y'all saved my financial need on the very next day!!!!  Thank you! Thank you!!!

They came through for me expeditiously and professionally...Just sorry that larger loans with monthly payments are not allowed in my state..."

James P,CashNetUSA came in mail as a pre-approved loan for a certain amount a week after a fatal attraction accident I survived. I usually ignore letters sent in mail for loans but I followed his spirit and my intuition to call phone number to finish application and so easily I was approved for amount said and my loan will be in my account within 24 hours. This came during a on time hardship in my life and Altovise my rep gave me the best customer services her energy was what I needed at time.
Troy,I write you're a true story because you won't give nobody a chance to get anything straightened out and help him with a long before they can get back on their feet I've had a very bad experience in the last year and a half to two years trying to get my stuff caught back up where I have got a major divorce and these people just don't want to work with nobody to help them out I'm on social security disability I am a older person that needs the help and these people won't help nobody all they care about is getting their last dollar so to me who this concerned I offered to try to straighten my account out with you just don't want to offer to try to help so I will rate you and a two-star business which is not really good at all so have a nice day and I hope you don't do no more elderly people like this they're not trying to help them out so thank you and have a nice day
Tevin L Kent,"Ms. Lynn was:1.	Courteous2.	Empathetic  3.	Professional Lastly, I have to say that NONE of the (stated) “traits” are possible if a person does not practice the “ART” of LISTENING.  Ms. Lynn is an EXCELLENT listener. I had ONLY to advise her of my issue ONCE; and before I could “Make Perfectly Clear” the reason for my call, I was advised “…Sir, if you were to check your account presently…you will find the ‘…stated issue resolved…”. I (personally) VERY SELDOM write and submit letter(s) of appreciation for someone (simply) doing their job. However, MS. Lynn was TRULY THE EXCEPTION in my (almost) 70 years of existence and interactions with (Average) Customer Service Representatives. I want to MAKE IT PERFECTLY CLEAR that Ms. LYNN is: No AVERAGE Customer Service Representative. She is a PROFESSIONAL. Her TALENTS (to include her empathy) are TRULY wasted in her current capacity.   I STRONGLY recommended that Ms. Lynn be promoted to a “SUPERVISORY” position or above. Ms. Lynn (if not promoted) will SOON “…be moving on…”.I (as a former Information Technology (IT)) Engineer and Administrator), would have IMMEDIATELY asked her if she was “HAPPY” in her current position; OR “…just ‘content”.  Depending on her response, I would OFFER her a Supervisory and or Management position at my organization. Sincerely,Kenneth JohnsonSFC/E7, USA/RET"

When I tell you, He was my Super Hero. I was on my lunch break running so late..!! He was determined to help me despite my antics. I EVEN thought I was been defrauded.

CASONDRA,"I've trusted CashNetUSA for years now with emergency expenses that have arisen from time to time. They can be a bit pricey when it comes to their fees, but the quick approval and funding are worth it for the peace of mind they provide."
GW-Texas,I only deal with two lender's and CashNetUSA is one of them because they don't give me any hassles or denial for a loan when I need it after I pay them back on the due date. I always can depend on them when I really need a pay-day loan and if I can't pay it all on the due date they let me pay it back in 4 monthly installments which fine with me and customer service is awesome and very courteous!
Karen,very helpfull
Robert,"Thanks for your service, & helpful personal that knows how to service it's customers... What a quality Company... I look forward doing business with now & future... I'll tell others of the company's good service... Thanks..."

Needless to say I won’t be using CASHNET AGSIN!"

Lisa,They are an excellent company.
timothy,They will be willing to help you when you need some financial help. Thank you CashNetUSA.
ann leverone,I have a $1300 credit line. I have paid it off twice. Interest rates are extremely high but it was to be expected however there's no penalty for early pay off and will save you money paying it off in full early. They gave me a chance when no one else would. The downside is they don't report to your credit so even if you've maintained a good payment history and available credit it won't better your credit score. I would give a higher review if they reported.
JOHN BAKOS,Incompetent!! I was approved for a payday loan and they sent it to the wrong bank account!! The account number was completely wrong! I call costumer service and they tell me to wait for the funds to be refused by the other bank and then call again tmrrw to check and then apply again on Thrusday when I get paid Friday! Completely defeats the purpose of a payday loan. I do not recommend this Incompetent company!!
Anthony Otero customer,I called CashNetUsa concerning loan avialability and all my questions were answered with complete confidence and I am looking forward to use their services
Bryan,The flex loan was there when I needed it. I like the fact that you can get your money same next day in most cases. I hated that you had to pay bi-weekly and that the amount to pay was extremely high and the balance barely moved. I was paying almost $700 a month for $1800 borrowed so you would think $700 a month would knock down the balance but it didn’t and then they continue to add interest daily. Use this temporarily not long term!!
Robert Bruhaug,Thank you Tracy for your help today! You totally get customer service!
ANNE,"I appreciate the ability to get the money I needed at the time. I just wish it wasn't at such a high rate of interest. Repayment is guaranteed because the account it's on is set up with my direct deposit and is well established. I've been paying for 5 months and have payed two thirds of what I borrowed and buy out is still more than I  borrowed.  It's disheartening.  However when your credit is bad from medical, past partners, and grown children what do you do?"
Kimberly,Awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome
Lon Anderson,It was a nightmare and miscommunication that us now resolved.
Virginia,"If you are in a bind, CashNetUSA is the place to go. They work with you even if you have credit issues. Their rates are more than reasonable, I have used them multiple times. With the pandemic, I got behind, but they still found a way to help me out and to pay them off without it hurting me. Wonderful company and a wonderful group of people working for them."
M. ALICIA WILSON,They help you out they work with you and they're efficient

Rehan A,I’ve been a customer for several years and tried to always make payments. I recently lost job and asked for my account to be frozen until I could either get the money from a retirement account or reconcile my payout from previous employer but was denied and so I will have to pay the 900 Dallas interest per month along with balance. Not much consideration for someone who has paid over 20 thousand dollars in interest but I should have realized that and never took out a loan in the beginning
Angella Suel,The staff member I talked with took the fear and showed respect for my situation.
BRENDA,I've used this company for almost 2 years. Never had any problems.

It was two days before payday and I was short $300 from the $350 Towing bill castnet came in and save the day obviously and I have been using them every since. You may think I'm crazy but I use them as a saving message now days. Meaning that I take out unnecessary loans and put them directly in my saving and I allow cast net to take their money payments every two weeks so it's like I'm saving plus a little interest lol
annette,Easy to reach always willing to help friendly and great customer service
NAKIA ,"She was helpful, pleasant and took time to answer my questions"
Linda Green,Very professional. Very helpful
MOISES,"A CS name Frank working hard for solve my issue. I verified with him my bank account and routing number are all correct. I applied a loan with high interest for emergency fund use. My loan was approve on March 28. Base on Cashnetusa.com policy. Once a loan get approve , customer should receive fund directly to their bank account on the next day. My load get approve on March 28 until today(March 30) I check with my bank, a funding has get to my bank account yet. I need money for emergecy use, that is right I paid for high interest short term. It turn out to be frustrate. No mercy..."

After paying over $1,000.00 my balance was higher than the amount I borrowed!! They must pay people to give them good reviews or make them up themselves. 325% interest is HIGHWAY ROBBERY!!!"

Audie,Great experience with this company they're very flexible when you need help with your payments
Jane,CashNet to me is a great place because they do not care if you have bad credit I was able to get a loan the same day yes the interest rates are just like any other place so don't borrow money if you cannot pay it back. But if you do need a loan this place is an amazing place to get one because of the simple fact that they do not judge anybody for their past credit problems
Manuel,As long as you use it responsibly you will love them... Great when you need a Lil extra funds between pay checks...
Sandra,"Yes, coming from me I chose the right place who has outstanding customer service individuals who go out of their way to make someone like very important and comfortable to talk with and assist me with any question or concerns.  Thank you for being so kind to me Jordyn.  Thank you"

Tricia Kiefer,Karen was the best she explained everything clearly she have patience she was knowledgeable caring and at the end of the day it takes a well raised person to be like her keep up the good work you're going places god bless you stay safe be well
Darrell P. and Diane P.,Best loan company Ive ever used. I dont have to keep reapplying for a loan because they have flex where you can withdraw from what you are paying back so I can go back and withdraw anytime I feel the need. The interest is a plus too. Im not charged double or triple of what I got a loan for. I would definitely recommend to anyone who needs funds same day
Vickie,I got great service
PAUL,Horrible Company. APR too high
Michelle,"CashNetUSAHas been so sufficient, efficient, and knowledgeable about helping you understand the process of borrowing money.ThanksCherrita Rich"

DEDRICK,"I paid $500 a month for almost a year, and still owed $2000 on a $1600 loan and it never went down. The interest rates they charge should be ILLEGAL. If you're in a bind, they DO NOT HELP AT ALL. Do not do it!!!! You will NEVER repay it."

sandra,Please do not do business with this company. It is a predatory loan company. You will end up paying triple the amount you borrow. And it’s a vicious cycle. You borrow pay it off and then have to borrow again to pay your bills take my advice and please do not use this company. I tried to make arrangements with them but they would not make arrangements
Sylia,The surface and politeness is whar i liked nest
Tracy,Very helpful kind and lead you in the process
Antwain,Besides the Interest being TOO HIGH.....they have commendatory customer support.....and the loan is readily available when you need it for emergencies etc....
Chasity,Cashnet is one of the biggest scams there is .If you can avoid this lender please do .I tried to pay off my loan and they wouldn't offer me a early pay off. They charged me almost more interest than the loan itself in 2 months. I still had to pay more than the loan itself. Avoid this lender if you can. It will only make things worse....................
Greatful,"I wish I could give negative scoring they apparently have no cyber security, our account number and information was given out. We were sent threatening letters to pay amount or that we would be sued and wages garnished. I have made all payments on time!! This company has made thousands from me over time. My husband thought he was helping and paid it in full 1145.00. The law firm is legitimate and Has your exact customer ID. Clearly your information is NOT safe here. Way to pay back what once was a loyal customer with excellent payment history!! I will NEVER do business with this company again, I work way too hard for my money. I could cry right now!!!! The worst part is the monthly payments will keep coming out for this horrible company that leaks your info soYou can be robbed of you hard earned money. I don’t know how these people live with themselves preying on people in a tough spot!!! DONT DO IT STAY AWAY YOU WILL REGRET!!!!"
Samuel Payne,"Yes the loan helped out so much and without question has been an excellent with customer care and prompt help  on the phone when needed . .  Now with that being said its high interest. People have to make money so i don't have a problem just be prepared to make those payments if you do get it, but in a pickle this will help you when others wont"
SHERRY,Biggest mistake of my life they target 1st time people who never had alone I've been paying on my $1700 loan for almost a year and a 1/2 And yesterday called the feel my balance was my balance was 1400 so I paid it all off And I will never again take a loan out with this company
ida,I have made 3 payments on a $2000 loan. So far I have had to pay $1600.00 and I still owe $2110.00. How the Hell have yall not been shut down for fraud.the interest is the highest that I have ever seen. Its rediculous!!!!!stay away from this company!!!!

My plant shut down, my wife out of work at x-mas. I couldn't pay on time. I still haven't paid. But this company has all the right stuff, and took the pressure off and have given me ample amount of space with incredible patients to sort this mess out. This is the company you have been hoping for. Thanks guys!"

Linda Barron,He answered all my questions first Ali and politely
SHAMARA,"I've been using cashnetusa on and off over the past 10 years. The max I ever get is $300, but it helps when you run dry on funds and just need a little bit to squeak by till next payday. The $25 fee for the loan feels reasonable and fair and does not make paying back too cumbersome on the budget. Would recommend for when you need a quick $300 and willing to pay back $325 next payday."
VH,"There was zero wait time to speak to a representative and the person on the other end was quick, friendly, informed, and made the process far easier than I anticipated. They hit all the marks on my customer service rating radar as I too work in the industry."

Bertha Richardson,To be woke-up out of a sound sleep by a phone call from a bill collector and not be insulted through the power of insinuation is a rarity in my life and a first. Thay is why I gave the excellent rating.
PATRICIA,THE BEST THING THIS COMPANY OFFERS IS LIVE HUMAN BEINGS WHO CAN GIVE YOU OLD FASHIONED ON THE PHONE CUSTOMER SERVICE. ITS NICE TO KNOW COMPANIES LIKE THIS ARE CONTINUING TO EMPLOY AMERICANS WHO CAN ALSO WORK AT HOME DURING THE PANDEMIC. WERE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER! LETS HELP EACH OTHER DURING THIS DIFFICULT TIME.
Samuel,Truly for all and all to know that there is much respect to gain and to learn above All Else dealing with cash net USA God bless and you all be safe !!!!!
Charles Reed,"As single person struggling as is, this was my worst decision ever. My car broke down, and started a new job because of COVID 19. So I didn’t have enough money to cover my bills and pay to fix my car. So I want with company from how great the reviews were. I got my cash really fast, which was great. However the interest is crazy! And they charge you interest  everyday. They don’t care if you have never missed a payment. I had only received the loan for $500. I have paid them so far $915.98, and they still say I have $368.45 out standing balance. And I got this loan originally in 8/14/2020, and I have not borrow from them since. So please don’t use this company, it’s not worth it. If you are strapped for cash. Try another company I will not use this company ever again or recommend it to anyone"
TS,Great service friendly and eager to help people
Cynthia Guzman,I can tell you that Cashnet was my life saver when i needed help. My whole experience has been top notch and my final transaction with Frank was excellent.

Clemenetine,If there was a one star option I would do it.    If your reading this don’t do this to yourself!!!    I had to pay off my account in full.   To avoid the 300% interest.   They are crooks!   After my payoff they still charged me an extra months payment for no reason!   Said there was nothing they could do about it.
Timothy,The service was great and the staff was courteous and professional
Lisa,Great service very knowledgeable

Larenco,This phone interaction is the kind I always look forward to when I need answers quick! I welcome good honest interaction and she has got it down pat! Thank you!!!
WILLIE,"At first I was super skeptical about working with CashnetUSA based on some of the reviews I read online. However, I was in a pinch and had no other options at the time. Although the interest is a little outrageous I received the funds I needed within 24 hours of the initial contact. I hit some bumps in the road when some of my due dates come up a few different times. Each time I contacted them and they helped set up payment arrangements that were easily affordable.Each and every one of the representatives I spoke to over the phone or chatted with online were all very helpful, knowledgeable, friendly, and empathetic to my situation, but most of all understanding that I too was a human being with actual issues. They also understood they were not the only bill I had to pay and Rent, Groceries, and Gas were more important to pay.  They also have options which allow you to pay off your loan or line of credit early. This for me was an excellent option because some companies do not allow you to payoff early because they want every penny they can squeeze out of you. If you are in a pinch and need some help quickly I would recommend CashnetUSA."

Kristopher,Cashnet always available to me when I need fast cash
MELODY,I think the interest rate is way to high and the loan I had with them I paid twice.  Finally I couldn't afford with COVID-19 until they offered me a settlement.  Never again

I’ve experienced nothing but professionals when needed to communicate about resolving a small issue. Thanks you CashNet for your services. I’ll recommend to all my family and friends.

Danny,"Not too many people have nice things to say about customer service professionals, but since I have been working with Cash Net USA, I have never had a negative interaction. They are always respectful and caring when I have to call or when I use the chat service. They never hand me off to other employees and they always help in a timely manner when I ask for clarity or service changes/updates. If I don't understand something, I have always been able to get a clear explanation...I can't speak for anyone else, but I, personally, have never had an issue with this company."
Christine Graham,Great person skills. Very professional.
Dawn,"VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED!!   If you are looking for a loan to help yourself and can't pay it back quicker than you wish.   DON'T USE CASHNETUSA!   I didn't mind that they draft every payday.  Where it hurts, is that the courtesy fees are ridiculous and makes the payment amount goes up because of those fees, not that you are constantly borrowing from the amount that you are approved for. :-((((((("
Brianna,Was able to pay off debt continue on my life appreciate you guys thank you have a nice day
RHONDA,"Most always my dealings are with personnel that are pleasant, courteous, efficient, knowledgeable and helpful to the max."

Reynalda,"CashNetUSA is a lifesaver when I am in a bind financially. Application process is easy and I receive the money within 24 hours normally. The only bad thing is the astronomical interest rate. For instance, if you borrow $300, you pay back $600."
Zenia,CashNet is AWESOME!! Cheapest payday loans and quick approval. Keep up the great work and Thank You so much for what y'all do. 😊 Peace & Blessings. 😇
Brenda,CSR was efficient and effective while courteous and helpful
Penny,enough already - do i need to say the same thing 3 times
Ida,I have been using cash net USA for about 2 years and they are the best. I lived in Texas for a short period of time and borrowed money from them and now i moved back to California and was still able to borrow money efficiently. I also love that you have the option to extend to your loan to a later date. They have always helped me out when I really needed the money. Thanks again for all of your hard work.
Pamela,My direct deposit from my job wasn’t in my account and she moved my payment to my next due date
Robert,Alyssa helped me fix my bank account. Hopefully now I can get my vehicle fixed. Thanks guy!!
Megan,"They work fast and are honest people I would go back thru them anytime,and they do not have high interest rates!!!"
Customer ,Amazing customer service
Dtmp,Listen after everybody gets lost and the huge corporate society and then they try to get a small issue resolved and they get shuffled through a bunch of doors unfortunately this is the way The larger corporate hast to work when you make a phone call to a company to resolve the problem you never get the top management you always get that in between the go-between but they have to deal with their manager but that’s not the end product dirt management goes to another higher level OK so everyone please understand it takes time to go through steps but in this case it took me at least six weeks to finally get to the fourth stepAnd they could not find any evidence to dispute what I felt they should’ve changed they changed it they gave me the needed refund they also call back to give me the needed apology and to wish me luck and health in the future and hoping that they can further help give me more guidance and support in the future which is about all that she can ever ask of the days multilevel corporate structures so what does it say I take my hat off waving salute to Cash Net America USA and I was like I said we thank you for your support

Osea,I got the loan prematurely and realized I didn't need it after all. Next time I will make sure to go to Cash Net USA for any of my financial needs.
Dante,Receive several loans from this company last year and this year applied for two and were denied without explanation. They said that they sent me an email explaining why and I never received it. I checked my spam folder and it wasn’t there either. They insisted they sent it. I’m asking for an exclamation I am not getting one and I find it very frustrating. Are used to like this company and today I find them very inefficient and unhelpful.
Johnny,The only reason I am giving 4 and not 5 is because I just started service however I can tell you the service is quick and efficient. Customer service was amazing! Although services likes this carry high interest but when you have to do what you have to do. I am glad cashnet USA was available! One of the best!
Linda,Very good quick cash loan very straight forward and ease of use.
Horace,You did a good job helping me out in this hard time we are having in this world right now thank you very much for your help 🌈🌈🦋🦋🦋

LINNERIUS,Very Helpful in this period of the unknown.Thank you.
lydia,"Very courteous, efficient, service. solved the problem quickly."
CHRISTINA,If you are broke don’t take out a 325% loan. It’s the worst idea you can have. Just ask whoever you owe money to let you owe them in weekly payments as opposed to this company. And that’s on period.
Tannisha,"Very polite customer service, solved problem fasted, got my questioned answered."
Patricia,The young lady tried very hard to help me. She gave me what i needed to do i am going to do it today.
Sandra,"To charge the rates you charge. When ppl are struggling and locked up with covid or the blizzards.  If someone is coming to you for help. They are already struggling.  Then to rape them with charges and make it even harder for them. Just wrong! Will get you paid,  close you completely and never use you again or recomend"
Shirley,"She was very informative. Great customer service. Helpful, and explained the terms of the contract very thorough. Overall she has great customer skills"
Kimmie,I got a loan the first time it was wonderful but I needed one extension which they gave me with wonderful and then I paid it back but now it will not let me get a loan anymore I don't understand why it will not approve me my financial situation if anything has gotten better
FRANCIS,Awesome highly recommend.
Ronald Waltman,Excellent service.
"Annie-Detroit,MI",Please do yourself a major disappointment and STAY AWAY from this company.  They will not disclose the actual terms of the loan prior to closing.  Once close they will charge you approx. $8 a day per 1000 loaned.  So pay $300 monthly (actual pmt higher) meaning $240 interest pmt.  If paying minimum payments would take in excess of `1 yr to payoff. STAY AWAY - DON'T USE - TELL EVERYONE - BIG BIG RIPOFF
Marlene,Great company to borrow money from it's easy process and the people help you in a fast matter
Mark Johnson,They were very helpful and understanding and they were willing to work with me
Douglas,Interest is to high!! My balance has not gone down at all!! they don’t take inconsideration that you have other obligations to pay but they take 2 payments out at the same time if you need emergency money consider another option not CashNetUSA
william jordan,Giving us with bad credit a 2nd chance to make up for the past.
Anderson,I have not had any issues and everything is clear to understand.

Kaneshia Gauchan-Leffall,"If you can help it, 🤬 NEVER!! 🤬take out any type of payday loan. The payments only increase every month making it almost impossible to pay off. Just get another job or rob a 711 first (jail time is better than the interest rate on theses types of loans!)... I’m so glad I am finally rid of this high interest rates debt!!! Oh praise sweet baby Jesus, I’m free!!!! 🥳🥳🥳🥳"

Riley,I made a mistake by applying for a loan with this company. I then find out they don’t offer loans in my state. It’s been a few months now and I received an email from their collection department saying I owed more than $600. This email said they had my email and SSN. It said they tracked my IP address. Of course they have my info I applied but I replied to the sender letting them know which state I lived in and wanted all info pertaining to the loan sent to me I didn’t hear anything else. Don’t give them your information
Joyce,"They are good for very short term, if you are late you will be in the hook and will pay 3 times what you owe."
Valentin Luboya,Excellent thank you so much
John,The fees are triple of a normal check loan on lines of credit.  They do have customer service after you get a $500 interest fee if you have questions. I believe I've paid $1600 in fees and interest in 80 days on a $1500 LOC. They put you in collections the same day your fees are due by 5 pm that day if you haven't made the payment. They prefer ach so they can force your bank. I thought it would be like a higher interest credit card but Cash Net managed to far out pace a bad credit card in fees. Luckily I can pay for this mess but alot of people wouldn't. Their only possible business plan would have to be to get as much in interest as possible before you quit playing it or go bankrupt.
rodney,They helped me very fast and efficiently!
TAMA,Received a call from cash net today and the woman on the other end asked if I had any question about my loan. I didn't but she did give me a little information about my loan. She was very pleasant to talk to and I believe she is an asset to cash net.

Lezlie ,I have used CashNetUSA to help make all my bills they are great to work with.
Doren,"I’ve been a customer with this lender well over seven years. Initially they were awesome, however now they are horrible. It states that you can get same-day funding after paying off your loan if you reapply by 10:30 AM Eastern time. Unfortunately they are not submitting the information to Veritec in the state of Michigan in a timely manner. Therefore you are not able to reapply until after 3:30 PM and funds are not sent to your account until the following business day which would be Monday.This is definitely misleading and false advertisement.  State the truth to the customers informing them that if they live in a state where Veritec has to approve the loan let them know it’s not gonna happen until after 3pm so stop saying same-day funding.!!!!!!"
Dj Crazy Caz,Don’t waste your time. If you can’t pay this loan off on one lump sum then all your monthly payments go straight to interest. I’ve made multiple payments and zero have went to principle. It’s robbery
SHEILA,"Save yourself the turmoil and find cash another way. This is a debt pit with incredibly high interest rates which ensure longevity of payment essentially doubling what you would pay from other trusted sources. Cash Net is not worth the quick and easy money it offers, find a better lender."
Lavosha,I was able to put off my payment date to a further date which fit my needs. Thank you Cindy!

Lakithie Oliver,Great company !!!Wll work with you on payment options.They helped me when I needed the money
Fabian,"I contacted Cashnetusa because I needed to change my payment dates because I lost my job due to the pandemic and just recently started to work again. I have told them I cannot make a payment and could they move my payment dates because of my salary structure is different. These fools are still trying to get me to pay on a particular date that I don’t receive my pay on. I told them about this a week ago and they are still trying to get money out of me.Update after Cashnetusa’s reply:If there were other options, customer service nor collections never reached out to me about them, but continued to send me emails about missing a payment."
SHERRY,"CashNetUSA is an awesome source of financial support. I know there is great risk for the company, but the interest rates are insane! Even in the midst of a pandemic there was no relief, or pause on interest rates or even a decrease in the interest rates for a month or two to make it less detrimental to the clients you serve during such an unprecedented time."
Debbie Waits Caudill,I received an email for a past due account and I was able to takethe 35% discount and pay back the balance over 3 payments.She was very helpful and understanding.

Tanya Nixon,"Cash Net USA has always been great to work with. Efficient, friendly, me professional."
BRENDA,"This place is basically stealing your money. Loans are fast and efficient but paying them back is a nightmare!! My Balance has been at $1800+ For the last few statements even though I’ve paid almost $700 in payments in the last 2 weeks. You would think that when I make a payment my balance would go down, but it doesn’t. I’m basically just giving them my hard earned money instead of it going towards my balance. At this rate I’ll be paying for the next 5 years!! DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR ANYONE!!! So glad they are not offered in Va anymore. It’s probably because everyone got tired of being robbed of their money!! Yes I know I borrowed from them and I am paying them back but it would be more of a relief if my balance would go down instead of up when I make a payment!!! So disgusted!"

Vernon,"You are still a wonderful, professional people"
Christina,"I have used CashNetUSA before in the past and they were very helpful, and this time with the Covid and what our country is going through, CashNet was there to help me once again. They are resourceful and patient and are willing to help."
Kevin Morris,Giving the lowest rating because I filled out an application online and I made a mistake and didn't put the bank account number correct and Cashnet sent the money to the wrong account number. I fault Cashnet partially because it was a 10 digit account number and accounts have 12 digits so how am I supposed to pay it back and never received the money? I have called about every few days explaining the mistake I made and never received the money but it is still charged to me. It was a 10 digit account number which isn't even valid for any bank. Calls to customer service and the bank isn't a help because I am still held for the money I never received. How is it my bill? I never received the money
BellaandLuni ,nice guy to work with
Rochelle,Cash net is the only loan place I will use they are great to work with and you get your cash very quickly.
Darlene,"These people are crooks. If you're looking cash in a bind with no high interest rates I urge you to try LendUp or Speedy Cash. They offer loans and depending on your payback history, multiple ones at the same time. Cashnetusa used to be reliable & descent when they offered the $300 payday loan. As soon as they switched to installment loan option I was done. You will end up paying 10x or more what they loan you. I urge you to PLEASE go else where and stay far away from these crooks."
Dorothy Weintraub,"Cash net has been great , approved and in my bank the very next day . They do work with you too if your in a situation ."

M G,Staff was very knowledgeable and patient when addressing my concerns
Demetris,Very good services and giving a chance to get my life back and pay my bills.awesome.
Darnice,"I made the unfortunate decision to borrow money from these leeches in 2019. The interest rates are ridiculously high and I paid them back in full in September of 2019. I just received a letter in the mail January 2021 about how they've sent me to collections on a $350 debt that I don't owe. I took pictures and documented everything and I paid them off IN FULL. They said they only credited $1000 even though my bank account shows that it was charged more than that for the full month. Every time I try to call the people are completely useless. Their customer service is just as atrocious as their 300% interest rates. If they were going to send me to collections for a debt I already paid, why wait a year and a half? Were they hoping I would forget about it so they could get more money from me? This is the worst place I have ever done business with and I'm not paying a penny more to them.Edit: I've called twice and the customer service reps refused to help me and all they did was tell me to call collections. They said they could only drop it if I get a letter from cashnetusa  saying that my debt was paid in full which you refuse to do. My debt was $1,133.44 and I paid you $1,134. They only credited my account with paying $1,000, so did you pocket the extra $134? I even called cashnetusa THAT DAY and they said I paid it off. When I called collections they said you sold my ""debt"" to collections 9 days after I paid it off, but I just got a letter about it THIS MONTH, almost a year and a half later saying I owe $350. So, no. I won't be calling your joke of customer service. What I will do is go to the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Consumer Affairs. Cashnetusa is nothing but a bunch of criminals."
Chademma,Great company to do business with and the associates are very helpful and nice. Can't get any better.
Jane doe,"I was given a loan and the loan was to be paid back on the 31st of Dec. as the New Year was coming. I took the advice of a chat person that it was and or should be paid that being my pension check that gets paid on the 3rd every month. But for some reason, it did not until the 4th of Jan. So because Cashnet tried to pull money out where there was none I was charged $25 bY the bank and then $25 from CashNET. I am taking the responsibility for this as it was explained how they take and or when they take the funds and how it is my responsibility to watch for this and be able to connect with Cashnet before the problem arises. So when it was time for me to sign the document at the end I should have said something then and hoped for a better outcome when I  Fingers crossed that soon my portfolios can be released  mm"
Kim,Very good experience would recommend to friends
Eva,Awesome customer service. Very helpful
Stacey,"They stopped me from getting involved with fraudulent activity regarding my loan! A person called me claiming to be from cashnetusa and wanted me to go into a store to provide proof and rent and utilities, etc. but I couldn't find the store on line so got in a chat and that's when I found out that it was a fraudulent person who called me!

Audra Wallace,Trustpilot help me by giving the money i needed to solve my problems.
Nycolai,"This is the third time I have used this company. I have never experienced any problems with obtaining a installment loan. However, this time I was only given the choice of a cab loan. The amount was over the amount I needed to borrow and it would not allow me to apply got a lesser amount. Secondly, if they looked at my pay now compared to the last time, it was decreased which means I couldn’t afford the larger amount! Also. In my business with them, I have never applied for a large amount! I have always kept it between $500-$600. I am very disappointed in the company. I needed the money to help with medical costs. I will go elsewhere for a loan and will not do any more business with this company again! We are in a pandemic and even the businesses that you have established a relationship with have upped their amounts!! It’s more or nothing at all!!!"
Michael Craig Powell,Cashnet has always came through for me when I needed the help

Charles Matherson,Everyone I have spoke to in the past and present have been very helpful.
Kayla,I appreciate the service I received in a time of need
Jeffery,Very good.Nice people.
Connie Sanchez,This is predatory lending at its finest.  At a time where the country is in turmoil to charge almost 600 a month on a 2k where the interest doesn't allow the balance to move down at all is hurting the people who are already suffering. Lower the interest rate to help the people.
Shannon,"Very satisfied, didn't have any problems"
Tiffany,They're are really amazing you can extend your loan if you don't have money I love them I always run to them when am in need of money asap
Denise,Good company to borrow from.  I will recommend.  Family and friends ❤

Donna,"Representative was extremely helpful, knowledgeable and patient."

SHE ACTUALLY MADE MY DAY SO MUCH BRIGHTER, SHE IS VERY GOOD AT HER JOB. YOU COULD HER THE KINDNESS IN HER VOICE, I WISH EVERYONE I SPOKE WITH OVER THE PHONE WAS AS  KIND AND UNDERSTANDING AS BRIANA WAS. THANK YOU BRIANA & CASHNET USA"
Diane,I've had several loans here always fast and professional and been a life saver when I needed it
Kornell,With the interest the loan is a joke @ 299% . Don't borrow from them. And the third time I've wrote this but keeps getting removed due to a bad review
Douglas C,The only thing I don’t like is the ability to pay your loan off isn’t on the app. The other loan apps have this option. It was a little difficult to finally get to the option of speaking to a customer service representative but when I did she was very professional and friendly! I would definitely use them again in the future!
David Wiseman,I needed help and I was able to receive it thanks to Sean! The best customer service representative for 2021!!!
Lucinda,"Need extra money to pay bills due to COVID layoff, cash-net approved me the same day, funds were deposited the same day, some bills were paid and it was quick. Had a step back before payment day and cash net gave me and extension to make my payment on time and in full. The process was quick didn’t get a billion questions asked and I was done. I say so far so good try them out."
CORY,The interest was high but I needed the money at the time.

Matthew,Had a line of credit and they raised my credit limit then stopped the line of credit and charged more interest fee and I can’t even use the account like I was using it. They will screw you over.
DALLAS,"I was approved for a loan today but they are sending it to the wrong account!! Where did they get that information?! I don’t have a chase account!!!! And the numbers are no where near my banks routing and account numbers so no, it’s NOT a typo! What a scam! I’m contacting the better business bureau IMMEDIATELYUPDATE: I called them today after receiving an email saying that I was not approved even though I got an email yesterday saying I was approved. This thing is a whole mess they said back in 2007 I applied for a loan with them and I used  a JP Morgan Chase bank account at that time. Well that is not the bank that I used when I applied yesterday. I don’t have that bank account anymore and haven’t since 2007. So they took it upon themselves to try send my loan to a closed bank account. I was advised this morning to wait until January 8th for Chase Bank to reject the loan. This place is the only source where they have a decent review rating. Everywhere else people have nightmares dealing with them...makes me wonder. So now I need to wait until the 8th and  pray that I don’t become one of the nightmare stories of them hounding me for money that I never received. Do your research!My Customer #11343840My full name is Chiemeri Collins. I am a real customer. I received an email today asking me to verify that information like anyone would make up something like this.."

RAYMOND,CashNetUSA has been more than a help for me and mine. I appreciate the opportunity they gave me to reach financial freedom. Thank you CashNetUSA!
John Younger,Many of us know and have experienced the difficult world of trying to get money when you need it. Cash Net USA is not not like any loan enterprise I have ever experienced. I was given a fair deal which has made paying unexpected medical bills doable. I can save face and feel good about it.
Shirley,My payments are never the same and my balance goes up then back down.. Makes no sense.
marilyn,"A very big help in my time of need,thank you."
Lynda,"CashNet USA is so easy and convenient to use.  Whenever I need cash quickly, I just log onto my account and request an advance and it's usually there same day if done by a certain time.  Signing up was just as seamless and customer service is great."
SHEENA,WORSE experience  EVER with a loan place!! If I could go back od go to a credit union  or something.  This place called me made arrangements and still ignored my arrangement. My child was in the hospital for 3 wks got out WOTH COVID (3wks Emergency surgery appendicitis then went back bc they nicked colon then on release day found out she was pos. For covid FROM HOSPITAL.) SO obviously no work while child is in hospital.  So the lady acted like she understood and would help but after phone call they took part of rent money then I call and there's NO notes of my arrangements so SOMEONE didn't do THEIR job and MY Family suffers. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!!
Ellen,Nothing happened

Trace,CashnetUSA has always helped me & I thank you
Sandra Dykstra Tarqueno,The customer service representatives were very courteous and allowed me to reschedule my upcoming payment with no hassle! They also offered very viable payment options to assist with repayment.
Susan,I had call the other day and the person that was helping me I felt dident go deep enough to solve my problem. But to daythe cleark today help with no problem.
Laura,Horrible customer service once you have paid down your balance and are not asking for more money. I have been told for at least 3 months that my account is in review which means they lock your account and do not allow you to see statements. I have never missed a payment.  I have called and emailed and my issue remains unresolved.
Suzanne,Cashnet is the best out there. Staff is friendly and answers all my questions.
Maria,"Every time That I inquire about the best time to make an additional payment that will go towards my principle balance, I am never given a straight answer.  I just paid over $1100.00 towards my balance in a 10 day time period and only $600 went towards my principle.  That is ridiculous!!!!  I made the extra payments to bring down my principle balance but the way they have these loans set up is to take as much principle up front as possible.  Which prevents anyone from paying them down quickly.  They are never able to tell me when is the best time to make an additional payment that benefits me.  Total SHAM!  How anyone can give this company a rating above one star seems suspect to me.  I do not believe that these are legitimate ratings."
Aminah,Not very helpful. I just tested positive for corona and asked for a 2 week forgiveness while I quarentine and they basically gave me the finger. Cashnet doesn't have your well-being in mind.
Erma Collins ,"CashnetUSA is a reliable loaning partner. Any questions are answered by their reliable, considerate and knowledgeable representatives."
Linda  sandford,The minimum payment almost doubles each week

Yolanda,Cash USA is the best Loan company in the business. They provide excellent service at all times under any conditions. YOU CAN TRUST THEM!
Howard Winston ,It was a pretty quick and easy process for me from time I fill out the application till money was deposited into my account. Interest is a little high but what do you expect. Nothing's free nowadays LOL. If you're in the gym and they need a quick cash I highly recommend
Dennis,"This company does provide you money quickly and without a big hassle. The money is direct deposited in your account within 24 to 48 hours and you make payments based on your pay cycle. It is unfortunate that it is not clearly explained how expensive it is to get a loan or line of credit from them. The interest is accrued daily on the outstanding balance of the loan. The annual APR is 299%. Yes!!  My advice is to read the fine print, ask questions, tough it out, go to your local bank. This was by far one of the worse mistakes I have ever made getting a line of credit while going through medical crisis, recovering from family related COVID-19, and struggling with financial hardship to pay for medical bills ."
TONY,This lender sucks big donkey ducks.  Avoid.
Linda,Sharon helped me with a missed payment due to an unexpected expense. She was very understanding and compassionate!

The year 2020 has been hard.....hoping 2021 will be better for us all........Thank you"
Kalyn,"Yeah, you get the money but their site isn't built with the customer in mind.  If you want to do anything, you have to call/get support because their site doesn't explain anything, nor does it allow you to get anything done with your loan, other than have it paid on the initial paydate or extensions. I wanna pay early but everytime I try, it never let's me & always claims there's an issue with my card/bank but somehow it works perfectly fine for them to withdraw it on the date they chose... Smh..."
carolyn payne,Had a ? About my appetcation. She answer fix explain to me my misunderstanding that I had.
Sherrie Chavez,Awesome! They approved me right away and it only took 5 hours for the money to be deposited into my account. I would definitely recommend them!!! 5 stars

Anna Mayes,"If i could give them 0 stars i would. I did a loan of $1000 abd so far i have paid $600 and i still owe them $1,100. I've also tried tlking to them about a new payment method because i have lost hours at work because of covid and the representative that i spoke to told me that there wasnt much they could do. However you set up your payments in the beginning is how they will stay. You would think that this company would be willing to help you more when it comes to a payment schedule especially with the pademic the way it is now. Just dont do it. You will be paying back 2x or more the amount you borrowed at the end of the day."

Heather Nelson,"I was about to confirm a transaction from CashNetUSA about an approved loan of $7k from a named_____, a Loan Officer, however his accent doubts me that his name doesnt match of his voice which sounds like Indian national. So when were discussing through text, his number appears and screenshot it at once. He has  options on how they will deposit from my bank account the said $7k and prior to it they will send me first initial deposit bcoz according to them my score was a little low and they want to boost it by me spending that amount to buy a gift card from bestbuy, wallmart, cvs or kroeger to return back the amount they deposited in order to boost my score and then deposit the total loan amount. For what reason I dont know but I think this is the best way I did to bring this with you.Thank you."

Then put the money in your account even though you didn't sign a thing for it then say you owe them 700 % interest! I contacted their financial department to take their money back out I didn't sing anything! They told me we can't do that you owe us 700% interested unless paid off early I said I didn't sign for anything thank you for the free money! Now they trying to sue me for their criminal practice s they put 650 in my account without my permission now say I owe them 3000 something unbelievable how these predatory loan places get away with being corporate thugs!Forced me to file for bankruptcy! DO NOT GET A LOAN THROUGH THESE CRIMINALS YOU WILL PAY FOR IT WITH 700% INTEREST! CRIMINAL PREDATORY LOAN S HERE! They lie on their response they flat out corporate criminals not here to help you at all! They know what they are doing is wrong and should be locked in prison for all the people they have ripped off over there existence!

JENNIFER,"Cashnet is one of the biggest crooked money lenders that charges a ridiculous intrest fee so that you will never pay back your loan and be done with them especially at this point in time when people are jobless and struggling to make end meet. This is a crooked loan site, stay away and do not get caught up in there debt scheme"

Sheila Hammonds,Raquel M. Is a rockstar and I told her so. I had requested an ACH deposit a day early and I would've only gotten a useable fraction of my deposit unless I was able to move it one day forward. She knew exactly what to do and had my problem solved in less than 2 minutes even though I was in a que line for chat assistance for about a half hour. I don't mind waiting but I hate bad customer service which I just certainly did not get. I felt like I was dealing with a well-oiled machine! Thanks Raquel!

BRIAN,The Young lady Erica is the best very caring and understanding person
QUENISE,"I regret taking a loan from themI regret taking a loan from them. I took $1,550 last year and today 11/30/2020 I called them and asked how much I already paid, they said, 3,048.00 and still owe them around $700 according to customer service, This company is not helping people but drowning them more in debts. Honestly is putting me in a worse situation then I already was in. Paying them 2x a month and getting an interest of 100% is not enough. It's killing me. Just a lesson learned. After paying them $3000 for a year I still owe $700??? This company is a thief!!!! I hope the management will rot in hell."

I’m actually able to make a credit card payment now thanks to this line of credit. Although the interest rate is high, that’s the price of convenience and it’s worth it."

Courtney,God is good. He worked through you to help people at the time of need

Jesus,"I have been a CNUSA customer for 5 years. We recently had a car payment come out early which caused a loan repayment to fail. It was paid back on next check, but no one mentioned they did not take $20 NSF fee. I found this and paid it on our own. Next time I applied, their employee told me for 15 minutes I was denied due to an outstanding loan, and that I was delinquent. A supervisor eventually figured out the $20 NSF showed as a PDL out in ND. Now I get denied every time I apply, stating my credit isn't good enough. Highly suspicious, and unfortunate they lose a 5 year customer after around 20 loans because an undisclosed $20 fee."

Andrew A,"I fill out an app for cash and the last step was my gross Income and each time I tried to Submit it would kick back and ask again for Gross Income. didn't know at the time. but it was because I had applied a week ago didn't complete the app' I did not complete it because I was asked to pay $1.00 for a credit score. I put in my information but each time a I pushed Submit it was not accepted. so I could not complete the app. But Cash Net USA did not know this. so I will have to wait 30 days before I can apply to them again for a loan. My Bank noticed a lot of recurring charges on my account that I did not authorize and four of them were from credit score reporting sites. They had been charging my acc. $34.98 each month. My Bank made them put it back. I thank the site I was sent to was one of them.and that's why I could not submit to get my credit score. I called Cash Net USA and they explain to me clearly why I could not complete there app, and gave me some good advice about applying for a loan. And also what to look out for. I am very pleased with I was treated. Even though I have to wait 30 days before I can apply to them again. I don't have that much time, but if I did I would wait. I like the way they do business."

William,"CNUsa great for in a pinch. My first loan was great i knew all expectations. However by my 3 advance, i started noticing the payment would flux. One day my balance would go down but two days later it would be higher by $3-$4 not something so big to notice. But i noticed. I always paid $20-$50 more than the payment due. This should bring the balance down and possibly my payments..wrong my balance would go up like i said $3-$4 and my payment fluxed between same $10. I hate when large companies think its okay to take from a needing hard honest bill paying person. Who has NEVER missed a payment OR EVEN ASKED FOR AN EXTESION DURING THE COVID PANDEMIC. Wow...really CNUSA jst replied a vague response. Im nit complaining about the contract. Im upset that upon my 2nd and 3rd issue of money your company stole from me. When i call to get an explanation your reps hang up on me. Im done i paid my bill in full and i will be sure to warn others of your approach."

Grace Jeter,"My experience with CASHNET USA has been a plesant one.  I use them one time before and decided I would return. But I was having trouble logging into my account.  So I called the help line and the representatives were very patient, informative and kind. They talked me through the steps of getting back into my account. They helped solved my problem in no time. I  would recommend CASHNET USA to anyone who maybe in need of a loan. Their team of Representatives are very professional and their interest rates are reasonable. They make the pay back affordable and less stressful.  After calling other loan companies and finding that their interest rates,  would put me in more debt than I would like to be, I 'm sticking with CashNetUSA. I have and will be recommending others to try CASHNET USA when in need of a loan."

Charmaine,Very quick I'm very happy with the service
Dominique,"The process consists of answering some personal and employment questions. Have your banking information handy to complete the routing and account numbers. It is actually very quick and easy. You will have a decision shortly. It is true that you will receive funds same day if approved before 10:30 am CST. I like that the email received that outlines your customer ID#, credit limit and advance amount (if requested), also notes all the ways you can contact CashNet if you need assistance or have questions so you feel secure about who you are dealing with.  After approval, access to your funds is simple, either log online to their website or download the App."
Nathan,I applied last night and my money was in bank today.  Cashnetusa.com is great and thank you for your help.
Mecole,299% apr. Daily rate nearly 10 percent. Please be careful out there. Ask your friend and  family beg them if you must. Pay them as of you would those lenders and pay them on time. Do not ever miss a payment to put your family in a bad spot. 0 interest (potentially) Pay your family first. Before you pay lenders like CashNetUSA who will take advantage of you financial situations. They will ask you why you need it and then spit on your face with an offer you absolutely can't refuse.  Please watch out.
PATRICIA ROGERS,Great company. Helped me every time I need it.
Jose Lavarreda,This was my very first loan.I'm still shocked at how easy and fast it was.I've decided to be a permanent user.

Pauline,"Cashnet is awesome. Excellent online services, except customer serviceKeep u the great work"
Connie,Great online lending source to use when in need of quick funds!
Christopher,They have some great customers willing to assist but not being able to get funding because of a 3 year old application decision of not being able to verify credit is dumb as hell. This policy is stupid! I applied 3 years ago and was denied for not being able to verify my credit and attempted to apply again today after 3 years and wasn’t able to submit a application! Shame on cash net USA and I don’t recommend this company it’s bogus! Send me all types of offers in the mail but when I attempt to apply I get turned down from doing a freaking application! I don’t recommend this source for emergency funding ahead of a hurricane or anything else to any family
Tara,I have been using CashNetUSA for years .  They are my go to when I need immediate hassle free emergency cash.  From day one they displayed professional courteous and friendly service!

The company cashnetusa helped clear up my issues, they helped me in a time of need initially and for that I am grateful, however I would suggest not going down this route as the interest on these short term loans are very high and costly. Get help with money management first!"
Michelle,Fast easy and trust worthy
THELMA,"Today I received a fraudulent email from CashNetUSA. It told me that I had a warrant out for my arrest. There was a judgement for 975.82. As I stood there shaking I was wondering who this is from. It looked legal enough. In the body of the letter it said to pay the fee before I went to jail by using a Vanilla One Card, and an American Express Card. This got my attention as I know that Scammers use these. But did  I have a Warrant out for my arrest.  I called CashNetUSA, immediately still trying to stop shaking and breath.  Their representative was great, had me read the whole letter to her.  We went over my Payments everything fine. She helped me calm down and let me know no Warrant. No judgement nothing. Thank God for a company that has real people on the phone and was able to help me. When your a Widow and living alone this isn’t funny."
Ralph,I have always had a good experience with them.  Easy to work with.  But interest way to high. Still a customer.

Scott in MI,I am very much thankful for the opportunity the customer service was outstanding
CHANTAL,I was behind a payment and they worked with me with no problems.
??,To be honest this is not like a credit card this is like getting a loan from the mob and you are charge three points a day so a person that is only getting a check once a month is paying out of their butts so I don't like this cash net and once I pay it off I'll never return again.

Timothy,"A Legitimate company m, especially there online department, for starting a payroll loan, l have used them for a few years now, and it has been helpful, and they work with be to repay if I’m ever in a bind, just call before due date for smaller installments, or you will have to repay loan in its entirety plus a fee, in its entirety, which is still generous on there part, because you usually can get another loan after payment , at least they worked and I hope continues to work for me when or if I’m I need, yes I’m actually a real customer, I can’t believe I wrote all of this, but it’s true, stay safe."

I'm 1 month away from paying it off and I have to say they have the best customer service. I do want to add that this should be your last resort since the fees are terribly high.

TOMAZANE,Had recieved a voicemail from a person claiming to be a cashnet representative also claiming i had been approved for a $9000 that i could use urgently but me also beeing aware of phone call scammers i decided not to call the number the person in the voicemail left and instead go online and live chat directly thru cashnetusa's website. The customer service rep Raneesha was very courteous understanding and easily understansing in her vigilanistic effort to my concerns about and for the questions i had while also helping me see if i was reeligable for a real loan through the actual company. Even tho i wasnt approved for the loan my main purpose for contacting cashnetusa was more than fullfilled thanks to their customer rep. Raneesha and will be the sole reason i continue to do any future buisness with cashnetusa.

Patricia,"I spoke with Kimberly this morning to help with resetting my password and email address.  She was definitely helpful by being patient, respectful and by knowing her job. We went through a lot, first I put the password in wrong, then I put the code that was sent to me in incorrectly, but Kim continued to be very professional and respectful by taking time explaining over and over until I got it right. She was great and it was very much appreciated. Now, my new password is set, my new email address is reset, and she even filled in what needed to be done to request the amount of draw from my account that I wanted. Great and professional with a seemingly great personality to boot.  Thanks Kimberly."

I PROMISE YOU!! You won’t be sorry . I’ve worked with them for a couple of years and will not go anywhere else, their customer service staff are AMAZING!! If you can’t pay on due date they don’t hesitate to help and understand tough times happen and they grant you extensions or payment plan if you need it. Love CashNet - so go go go!!! Why wouldn’t  you if you need emergency money they are the people to go to. Thank You so much for all you do CashNet and your amazing staff!Maria -Dallas,TX"

Bella,I have been very happy with the service I habe received each and every time.Wanda Weible
James,Satifyed service fast and explained
Raymon,Cashnet reduced my available credit shortly after covid 19 shut down a lot of places. Even though my income was not affected at all. Nothing changed for me. They just reduced my amount available for no reason. When people needed help the most Cashnet failed to help. This is the worst kind of company. Instead of being there for their customers they made getting money harder. Don't do business with this company if you care about companies that are actually there for their customers.
TRISHA,"CashNetUsa is wonderful. I am very thankful to this company. I received the financial assistance I needed. Sincerely, Thank you,Princess P Horton"
Tilaha,Cashnet has been an excellent loan company and has worked with me whenever I needed help with anything to do with my loan.

George,The fastest and easiest way to ever get a loan amazing !!!!
MaryCarroll,CashNet is there when I need them and it is super easy and fast.
Blane,"If you are desperate enough to use cashnetusa you should probably rob a bank. You won't get screwed in prison as hard as cashnetusa will screw you. I had used a different service and expected the fees would be similar, but cashnetusa charges much higher fees and they start the interest on day 1. No chance to avoid the interest by paying in full within a month, they are hammering you from the very start. But the absolute worst thing they do is they hold your payment so they can continue charging their exorbitant interest. Made a payment 2 days ago, they acknowledge the payment was made, but my balance does not reflect it and the 8 bucks a day in interest keeps getting charged."
Renee,The service was very quick. It didn't take long at all. I will use them again. Thank you for your service.
Tyron Ward,"Customer Service Representatives were all so helpful and professional. The approval process went through effortlessly, and the customer service representative walked me through the process with so much patience. Got funds exactly when promised."
Ashley Smith,This company has been drafting payments from my account for over a year..on the wrong day. When I changed jobs my payday changed but they would not change it to match. This has caused countless amounts of overdraft fees for me. I have reached out to them several times to help. But they won't.  This has to be unlawful.  I think I'm going to seek some legal help.
Bee,"You guys deposited the money into my account much sooner than I though, and I truly appreciate that being as how I needed some financial help right away."
KAREN,Great job! They helped me get the information and cash I needed! Pros!
Stephen Clemon,You guys are awesome you helped me out when I needed it thank you

marvin,Not YET 8696Soon I hope
Latoya,"Cash net helped me out a lot.They come in handy when you need to pay for bills,food and anything else.I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a payday loan."
Ancira,"Given the current conditions we are in globally I was at my wits end. I had no idea what I was going to do. I was about to lose my car and other important things in my life. I went to Google and typed payday loan companies near me and CashNet USA was top of the list. So, I began to apply for a loan. I had no idea if I was going to be eligible, but I had to try. Long story short, I applied in a few minutes, was approved in a few minutes, received what I needed to get over the hump that was before me in a few minutes. The weight that was upon me was lifted."

Craig,The customer service is amazing! I was having issues on my online account so I called and they had the issue fixed in under 5 minutes! Highly impressed.
Allen,Awesome experience
Cherrita Rich,I got a loan last year when my car broke down . They increased my limit and I always make on time payments. If you have the money to pay them off instantly then sure . But making monthly payments is a no. My BI WEEKLY PAYMENTS were 250. A piece so 500 overall. My loan was for 1700. No matter how much I paid or did I could NOT pay it off. I also asked for a settlement offer just anything to get this debt off me and account closed. Customer service informed me that they don’t do settlement offers which I’m sure is a lie. Anyways I did some debt consolidation and just paid the whole thing off and I hope to never deal with these ppl again . Definitely would not recommend as a lender . The high interest rate makes it impossible for you to pay them off. Yesterday my payoff was 1823 and today my payoff was 1872 . Please unless you’re seriously desperate do not go this route ! There are definitely better lenders with lower interest . Good luck
PAIGE,"Very helpful, fast and got me what I needed."
Jack,Excellent. They were there when I needed help several times.

Brenda,I have been a long time customer.  I have received nothing but positive feedback and assistance from this company.  Customer service is awesome.  Rates are high but service is great.

Samantha ,Cash net is amazing and fast!!
Catherine Stewart Doty,"Fast, easy and convenient! 5 stars all the way"
BEVERLEY MASON,Easy to get approved but the interest rates are ridiculous! 276% interest rate on a 1200 loan! There is a reason they approve everyone so they can make their money on these crazy interest rates! I nearly paid $2500 in just interest before even paying back my loan!
Juan Olivieri,This process was very easy and it took no time at all for me to get approved. I recommend cashnet to anyone seeking a payday loan.
Raymond,Very helpful & fast right on time with my needs. Needed help with bills & food & got the loan within 20 minutes
 Sunday Adeboye,"Absolutely ridiculous. I was approved for $800 yesterday and was told I would get the funds by end of business day. I realized I may have made a mistake on my account number so I chat with someone and I give them the proper account number who then confirms it as correct. Awhile later I hadn't gotten my funds yet so i called and gave my account number to confirm, they also said it was correct. I called back one more time not understanding why NY funds are not in the account just to find out, it wasn't the right account number. I tried giving her the right number and was told I couldn't, and it could take up to 5 business days to correct then error. Is this some kind of scam to get my social security number, bank info. Etc??? U can either deposit it on the right account as I asked or I can take it up on social media, the new, or better yet my father works for a radio station out here called The Fox. They do the Chiefs games which hundreds of thousands of people watch and listen to just for that one on day. I am not threatening, but I need that money asap"
JULIE,I loved the approval application didn’t take long and money is already in my account

Margaret,Cash Net was very easy to use and straightforward if I was ever to have an emergency again I’d use them again
MICAHAEL,"Getting funds is a simple process, no complaints there. But they arbitrarily changed the credit limits AND how they calculate minimum payments so they are now larger. That seems pretty shady to me."

Roberta Gentry,Very quick and easy experience. Would recommend to anyone.

Brian,I am so thankful for CashNetUSA everybody was so helpful I am very pleased and will use them Everytime 😊
Cris Sandoval,Great service and quick turn around time. Grateful to be approved for the money when I need it. Only con is that it would be easier to know how much payments are and how long you have to pay it back.
customer,"They're okay for when you need quick cash. I've been in a bind since COVID happened and had a few medical bills pop up that I needed to get rid of. However, I will say that the amount that you pay back is crazy. I've paid on them up to four times now, and haven't really seen the numbers go down. When I asked them why it was that I didn't have any line of credit for how many times, and the large amounts that I've paid them, they said it was because the majority of the payment goes towards fees. Which is insanely crazy. I should have looked into it more before making my move with them. I wouldn't so much as recommend them unless you are really desperate for help and need funding quickly."
JAMES,What a lifesaver and seriously the same day in my account.  Thank you.
Michael,"BE AWARE!!!!!! This is a SCAM. I have fully paid EVERYTHING off MONTHS ago and they are still contacting me about payments, as if it is not already paid off! NEXT STEP IS COURT!"

ANGEL,I have gotten two payday loans from Cashnetusa and had no problems until these last two times my request for a payday loan has been declined both times for some reason. Now with Covid19 and i need help Cashnetusa has turned their backs on me for some godly reason. I have never missed paying my payday loans back. So I will not be recommending Cashnetusa to my family nor my friends or anyone else for that fact. I will take my business somewhere else then. Screw them
Deborah,I use to love cashnetusa but I went to go to apply for a loan and they say that they don't use online banks. I  have always had the same banking information but now all of a sudden its always been this way that apparently. Really wish I could get my information off this website but no they get to keep my info.

Melody,Thank u guys for everything always there wen I need u guys fast and easy fast funding up to 500 very good but wen past 500 payment kinda high so that y the four star but still that being said u guys still the best thanks for all the help
Stephanie,Fast response time and no hassel with getting information needed to complete loan. Thank you for your help!
Michael,Cost me over $200 to borrow 600 for 2 weeks. Loan sharking at its best. Contacting the attorney general. Will never use them again. That's what I get for being a valued customer.
Ang,"I have been a customer with cash net for about a year. Everyone is Very helpful, specially in these hard times. 5 star from me. Plan on staying with them for a long time!"
Jonathan Mason,"The good is getting the loan, or not.The interest can be high and tends to grow quite rapidly. But my main issue is rate of repayment and due date.For example, if you are paid bi-monthly on the 15th. and 30th. CashNetUSA due dates fall around the 11th. and the 28th, this can cause you to get hit with an NSF. If you're not watchful, you'll find yourself borrowing more just to meet the minimum payments and find yourself worse off than before.Stuff happens so it's good to shop around and not only read but comprehend the fine print before signing. It's best to have a plan to pay your loans back as soon as possible and doing so can make this a good experience."
teresa,good afternoon im happy that thank u again other again....smile have a good day
Michael,They have been helpful and courteous.
Raven,I was denied by others and cashnet came through! Quick and easy process!
ARNOLENE,Just finished .So I haven't got my money yet
jamie,Easy to complete application. Still have not received my funds
TERESA,"I can always count of them to get me through rough times, and they aren’t like other loan shark companies they work with you if you can’t make a payment."
Jeremy,It was fast easy and convenient thanx cashnet
Barron,I know this for fact .our own government would rather give businesses that have money and resources business loans but those of us that's busted our tails never ask for a penny from anyone ever .but cash net had no problem giving me money to survive I may have to even use my credits each month but I'm living barely but thankful even paying 1000% better than what out government has offered.so quite gripping see what you get from the government I promise you will thank cash net too.
customer marcia Bradley ,Very easy transaction and a huge help when in a bind.

william,It was a quick process The process was really quick and came at I time when I really needed the extra funds.  I would hope highly recommend Cash Net USA to anyone.
Amanda Blackwell,They don't give money to someone that gets paid almost 2000 a month sorry if you ask me
Lillie,They charge 1000 present interest...worse than the loan sharks ....people do not know how to calculate interest rate .and believes it is 299%  but it is over 1000% ...even 299% it is criminal .and destroying families.
Jade,"You guys are the best.Sometimes a bill comes unexpectedly, an everytimeyour service has helped me.Thank you."
GENEVA,Many thanks for your quick response to this Pandemic.
Joanna Lowes,My experience has always been excellent with you guys
Joyce,"I have taken loans from cash net USA  for over 4 years. made all payments on time. they charge up to 1000 present interests...today they refused to approve a stinking $250 loan...I do not know why I have good credit ...I told them to remove me from their system...due to many people complained to the BBB that their information got out to criminals... but they refused, they are evil...stay away from them. I went to a loan company online the name is RISE , got a loan on the spot interest rate was 28%....  I was stupid to work with them as the charge not 299% interest but over a 1000%.as you see their response ...they have no answer...and they did not address any of my complaints ...I am working on revoking their license in my state as many other states already did."
LAUREN,Very helpful info and quick assistance when you need it.
Darnell Pollard,So far three star as customer service has been excellent and it's been a very straightforward process. I will rate 5 if I actually recieve my loan.
Jeremy,THE PROCESS WAS VERY EASY.  IT TOOK A FEW HOURS TO GET THE FUNDS.  CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS VERY HELPFUL.
Michael Kelly,"Very quick, intuitive and concise.  Why didn’t I think of this before?  Thank you"
issac,"This is a predatory lender - be careful. I have paid double the minimum payment for months and am making little progress toward the principal. It's disgusting, really. People are suffering during this challenging time, and companies like this are capitalizing on their financial pain. Yes, I applied for the loan. Yes, I took the money. But, please, stop milking me for every penny you can get. It's pathetic."
Brooks,"Ridiculous, run. Way too expensive and can’t get help with customer service."
Cleofas,It was awesome that not required to filling out application. It was simple and quickly.
Sharon,"Fast, and efficient. Needed emergency help and you gave it quickly without sending me to a bunch of other lenders. Thanks!"
Nathaniel,Very happy with the service money was in bank when promised
ANDREA,It sucks and I do not like it I cannot stand it.
Joseph,"Super fast and easy to use. So far, I have had no issues with CashNet.  During a 6 month period, my loan amount possibilities were lowered with no reason, then poof, today was listed more than ever borrowed b4. Interest rates are morbidly high everywhere, but so are other payday loans. Another company suckered me into a line of credit. My bad for asking for help...During this time, and the economy, this company, (any loaning facility), is, are taking advantage of the vulnerable at this time with interest at 299%+.Cmon, really?! I tend to do the monthly loan, yeah, the $50ish fee for just doing a few bucks for a couple hundred. Banks r constantly being bailed out, but we have to beg for help becuz the banks, and all lending companies, interest charges are ridiculous. I know it would be a cold day in hell b4 any money lending agency, gives a break in interest rates, or lowers interest payouts. We can all just dream that little dream until we are all starving... then who is going to borrow money then?"
Jasper Owens,I have been with Cashnet for almost 2 years now and any problem was resolved and no  hardship on my part. They go above the call of duty. Love them and now they are the only program I use. Keep up the good work Cash net😎

MARY,Cash Net USA was easy they explained what they were doing and what to expect.
Mica,"This is the 2nd review I am given this Company.I have been using this Company for more than 2 years i had been getting the 1800.00 payday loan.Then Covid 19 came and they discontinued it and only had 500.00 loans which don't help me very much if I need to fix something in my house or car.Anyways I really just thought the World of Cashnet USA until....two days ago i looked at the loans and they had put the 1800.00 payday loan back.Well i called and i applied online too to sign documents.My Plumbing in the back yard is leaking really bad and I need it fixed last 2 weeks i had borrowed 500.00 from them to pay for the plumber to fix the front faucet it was also leaking bad and had to get a new fawcet put on cost 385.00 almost all of the money I borrowed from them. I Called them on payday and gave them my credit card..to pay off my 500.00 loan Then when I went online and saw I could now borrow my old 1800.00 I was going to go ahead and fix the back yard fawcett and fix my indoor bathtub fawcett. I am having problems with it too.I apllied and spoke with this girl and she said she would put it through.Then I got a call from cashnet usa about 10 minutes later and I answered it and they hung up..this was in the morning then about 530pm I get another call from a different girl telling me that now I have to send her my bank statements.Hmmmm thats odd after two years of loans from them and a loan I just did 2 weeks ago and paid back now I have to send them my personal bank account statements ..( and these people are working from home) No way I am not sending my bank statements to anyone.This just does not sound right all of a sudden now they need my bank statements.So I told Her I don't want to do the loan because I am not going to send ANYONE my bank statements they want to loan me the money and get the 300.00 or 400.00 back from loaning it to me that's fine ..But its not fine that all of a sudden they need my bank statements.So the next day I called to speak with a supervisor and of course not available and then this rep told me that I now need my front and back of my ID and I also Need my Bank statements too. I told her I want to know why now you need them after more than 2 years.(She couldn't give me an answer)I won't be using Cashnet USA anymore they won't be making several thousand dollars off me ANYMORE ( I have opted out my info to them on their end) and I have other Companies who will loan me money with my bank account info my social security number and my signature.I USED TO WORK FOR CITI BANK FOR 10 YEARS AND I AM NOT APLLYING FOR A HOME LOAN ( THEY DO NOT NEED YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION UNLESS THEY ARE PLANNING ON SELLING IT OR USING IT ) THIS IS A SMALL LOAN FOR 1800.00 NOT A 50,0000 OR HIGHER LOAN.ITS ALRIGHT ITS THEIR LOSS NOT MINE BECAUSE THERE IS ALOT OF OTHER LOAN COMPANIES THAT WILL BE HAPPY TO TAKE MY MONEY FOR BORROWING SHORT TERM FOR EMERGENCIES.DONT WASTE YOUR TIME UNLESS YOU LIKE GIVING ALL YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO A SMALL PAYDAY LOAN COMPANY WHICH I JUST WOULDN'T RECCOMEND TO DO. ESPECIALLY SINCE COVID AND PEOPLE OUT OF WORK AND PEOPLE DESPERATE FOR MONEY.NO WAY! I WOULD ONLY USE A COMPANY THAT NEEDS THE BASIC PROPER INFORMATION. ANYTHING MORE I WOULD BE VERY LEARY AND SUSPICIOUS..ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE GUARANTEED INCOME COMMING IN ON A REGULAR BASIS COVID OR NO COVID.AND OPT OUT OF COMPANIES IF YOUR NOT PLANNING TO USE THEM AGAIN..AND FYI  A SUPERVISOR NEVER CALLED ME BACK EITHER.THANK YOU CASHNET USA FOR SHOWING ME WHO & WHAT KIND OF COMPANY YOU REALLY ARE.."
Joe Shmoe,I have been a customer for a few months never had a issue until now I made payments but I’m being told I’m confused you can’t confuse math my availability should be more but going over the math 4 times with 4 different people including a manager they are still not caught all they way up mentally so I will never NEVER NEVER NEVER MESS WITH YOU AGAIN EVER your not sensitive to customers during this Rona and you think ur high credit line help no Go play in traffic all of you

Calvin Nez,Good customer service with no problem
Miranda Ann Cooper,Very helpful and friendly
John,"cash net is great for a payday loan only. if they offer you a line of credit do not i repeat DO NOT!!!! take it. They offered me a 2,000 credit line with the interest rate at 299% annually which i had no knowledge of until i called and asked.You will be paying back 4 times more than you borrowed. It is a set up and unfortunately i was suckered. They don't explain to you that the interest is accrued $10 daily regardless of your due date. ex: If your payments are 175.00 bi weekly only $75 will be applied to your principle $100 towards interest but by the time your next due date the $10 daily interest had accrued. It is will take me 18 months to pay off this TRAPPED loan.  These people are a rip off. i will look into filing a class action suit . i do not recommend applying for line of credit with CASH NET. Stick to a normal payday loan only if its an emergency."
Wanda,I had a hard time with no work. Appreciate your team working with me until I got back out of the red.
Andre,"I have been a CashNetUSA customer since 2013 and could not be more pleased with this company! Their Customer Service Professionals are exceptional. They explain in easy to understand detail, make sure that you are satisfied, and always check to ensure that they have taken care of your needs. Your finances are always received when indicated, which is always by the next business day if requested by early evening. I have always had my payments automatically deducted and have never had an issue with the payment date being altered in any way. It's been the most enjoyable experience I have ever had with a company, thus the longevity. I have recommended this company to many and always get positive feedback and gratitude from those who have used CashNet. They are only a phone call or email away when needed and the request process could not be any easier. I intend to do business with them for a long time!"

Latoya Mathis,Very understanding and responsive to my needs
MikeeRayOfficial P,"I applied for a loan on 07-21-2020 and it turned out to be the incorrect type of loan. I chose payday and it should have been an installment loan. When i realized what I had done, your company was quick to correct my error. I was able to resend the loan. I will be able to reapply in a few days for the correct type loan. I am so appreciative of your positive help. Thank you so much. I don’t believe that many companies would be as understanding. Your company representative was both knowledgeable and very understanding. Thank you for that."
Andrew,"Very fast to fund, but extremely high interest rates."
ALBERT,If used properly CashNetUSA will allow you to have resources for emergencies and for those times when your cash is a little short. Be respectful of the service and you will be afforded the trust and respect you deserve.
RamonaB,I was low until payday. Needed groceries and gas. Cashnet usa saved my life thank you.

Lucyann Lester,YOU ALL WERE THERE WHEN I NEEDED IT THE MOST
ROLANDA,They worked with me and payment plan is nice 👍
Brian,I've paid back my loan twice now. The virus hit me hard and these people decided for the second time to overdraft my bank account.  I called twice in one day to arrange payments.  Then they just take one hundred dollars out of my account!!!! What a joke!!
Brittany,Just always good to know as you are paying back your loan that when a need come up cashnetusa has basically money in the bank to loan you as the need comes up so thanks again coming through during this covid 19 time's

RICHARD,"🦋There in time of need, with no hassle."
Juanita,Very helpful abd understandinf when I needed to liwer my payments
Refugia,Great experience. Very helpful. Very easy to get my money when I need it
Joanne,"Warning!!! Never Ever get a loan with these people no matter how much you think you need it. I promise you will totally REGRET it before you’re done paying it back. RATES are outrageous, payments RIDICULOUS, not knowing your upcoming payment amount UNHEARD OF until just before due date, understanding why you’re expected to make the upcoming due payment when you’re scheduled to make an arranged payment that was set up, but they’re still expecting a monthly payment as well, if I was able to make a regular payment there would be no need to make a payment arrangement in the first place. You may have paid the borrowed amount back but it doesn’t end there, trust their system, you will pay much more than you expected unless you just pay what they tell you is the balance in full at once. My advice to new APPLICANTS, DON’T DO IT, DON’T DO IT."
ELVIRA,No problems on requesting or receiving money. Would appreciate if you could withdraw in 25 dollar increments instead of 50 being the minimum limit.
Mary,Keep having problem login.it takes about fives to ten minutes to login.i tried call Iiing to see if I could get a extra fifty dollars but couldn't get answer.I am quarantine to home.cannot get certain that I need.If can help I would really appreciate it thanks 😂😂😂
Phyllis,I love cashnet they have been very efficient
Vanessa,"Always their when I need extra money, especially during these unfamiliar times. This is the only loan I have ever received that I can actually see decreasing when I pay the monthly payments."
Carol,I’ve always been very happy with Cash Net. Never had a problem with my request!
Barbara w,As long money goes in early mon .  Am will be good.
Albert,"I recently paid off my outstanding balance, and was able to withdraw some funds out instantly."
david,"I’m hoping anyone who sees this actually heeds this warning, I took out a $1250 loan with this company about 7months ago, and have paid them back close to $4000 in that time yet somehow I still owe $1000. I made a $500 payment and only $200 went to my outstanding balance and the rep told me that the rest went toward interest. They don’t want you to pay this loan off. They want to take whatever money they can from you until you can’t stay afloat anymore and offer you to draw more credit. Don’t get a loan with this scam of a company."
Richard,"Quick, easy and efficient."
Nancy,Always easy to work with and funds have always been available next business day. Only complaint is having to pay a 15% service fee each time you pull from your credit as the interest is high enough on its own so kind of a kick in gut when you have to pull a large amount out at once.
Cordarius,Y’all was there when I really needed you!
Audra,"Cashnetusa.com comes in handy when I need extra cash. Even if I call, the reps are kind and polite and willing to help. In this day and time, it's good to have such professional people to work with."
Ethel,Felicia is amazing. Always such a positive and happy woman. She’s also personable with her customers. She needs a raise but not one that takes her out of the office because she makes the whole experience awesome!
Jeffrey,"Great customer service, but if a payment is due on a specific date, don't process it until then. Further, debit and deposit right away. Both of these make it look like there's money when there isn't. It's pretty dishonest."
Gary Moss,Whenever I'm in a bind Cash net is a save. Thanks so much.
Russell,"Always, great service!"
Ronald,"It was FAST, quick, and easy. Get the cash you need fast and easy. Thank you!!!!"
RaSheedah,CashNetUSA have come through for me time and time again. I recommend to everyone.
Jon,very helpful and quick. Interest is a little high though.
TL,"I love cashnet USA it is everything they say they are, the money is on time and in your account the next day and there's no need to ever re apply. Thanks Cashnet for being here for me.                                      Rhonda C"

Scott Balcer,"CASHNET USA REVIEWMarch 2019After weeks of applying ppersonal loans and being rejected for pre-qualifications apps due to poor credit (below 600), CashNet.USA was the first lender to take a chance on me. I found the process fast and painless and was approved within minutes of applying. I needed $1000 and was approved for $850 (which at this time, beggars can’t be choosers). A couple hours after I requested my advance, it was cancelled as I needed additional documents sent such as my recent paystub and driver’s license. Once I emailed the missing documents, I received a response within 12 hours approving me to submit another request for my advance. The next business day, the full amount was in my account. (Keep in mind: the balance you must payback is the requested amount +15% fee). At this point, I found the customer service fast and was pleased with the results.June 2019Quick update: my credit score has improved since I was able to withdraw this loan. However, I am nowhere near paying off the balance. The payment dates are set up based on what you submit for frequency of payment (biweekly, bimonthly, etc). My contract has me on a biweekly payment schedule and that daily interest is no joke. Lets just say, for every $160 I pay, $140 gets added back in interest by the time the next due date comes around. The goal is to pay back 2x the amount from here on out . All in all, it’s nice that they worked with me during my time of need, but I definitely trapped myself in a vicious cycle of “borrowing money to pay back other borrowed money”. July 2020Another Update: here we are a year from when I applied for the loan and I’m sad to say that I’m almost halfway paid off. I will admit that since June 2019, I have cashed out $50 here and there, with my last withdrawal being back in Jan 2020. Despite my mistakes, I have continued making my payments on a biweekly schedule, throwing in extra ($15-25) every other payment or when funds are expandable for the month. As it stands today, I’m still pleased with CashNet but I really must caution all prospective borrowers to seriously research all of their options and make sure they’re in a financial position to borrow any amount from any lender, but especially cashnet."
Galal,"It's been months since I've borrowed but as always,you helped me and was very understanding and professional when I was late...Thank you so much"
Sassy,Willing to work with people who are having challenges during this time of economic decline.
Megan,these people here are so amazing and understanding would tell anyone to come to them great people.

Gregory,Quick responses and very helpful. Will keep doing business with them.
Jonathan Aragon,My experience with Cashnetusa has always been great.
EDITA MAMARIL,"I paid my account in full. They continued to say i owed more interest that didn’t make sense - because i made payment on line with a debit card instead of calling payment in.  I tried  to call 3 times. Asked for a manager. Was told manager would call me back. Instead received an email at 09:30 pm NO phone call; email read  it’s too late to call now, call us back tomorrow if you need more assistance. Called the next day to start the same process. Still have not spoken to a manager while they keep charging interest in a fictitious balance. Very shady company."
AlabamaCustomer,Awesome company. Very quick all around! I applied on Sunday and it only took me 24 hours to get the money I was approved for and I bet it would be faster if you didn't do it on a Saturday or Sunday.
T. Brown👍,Never have a problem or a long wait time to get the money
Corinne E Roosen,Joyce was awesome in explaining everything I needed to do to receive the money including discounts and holding great conversation! I'm glad I have utilized this program!

SC,You all have been so kind to work with me on a repayment plan.  Thank you so very much!
Rod,CashNetUSA’s line of credit is so easy to make a draw as well as easy to pay off. The interest rate is a lot lower than most pay day advance places so you can pay it off faster. The customer service is great and the app provides ease of use for both withdrawing cash as well as paying it back. Love CashNetUSA!
NORA,This service helped me when I needed it. Thank you!
STEVEN LAWRENCE,"Cash Net USA was referred to me by my honey, after I almost got scammed. Cash Net USA was very responsive & fast. I went online & signed up with a third party & received several hassles & was told to send $ first. I was surprised when Cash Net USA approved me right away."

Terry,Cashnet has always been there for me when I need extra cash
LILLIAN A,This line of credit is an easy quick source of funding but it is highway robbery. The amount of interest these thief's charge should be illegal. Its absolutely ridiculous. I strongly suggest you try all other options before this one.
Mary,Always on time
Jeffrey McDowell,Iv’e tried multiple time but always get denied. I never have a loan from here before or anywhere else. Horrible how they say no credit check and you get turn down smfh.
Nicholas,All good and time frame for approval was quick
terri,"I had a little trouble at first navigating the website (the what state are you in part) but it didn't take long to get right back to the loan application, so thereafter it was a quick and easy process."
Rickie,Very good service will recommend to anyone
Terrance,Without a doubt they are the best! I don't mind the interest when it saves me a $35 return check fee. They are streamlined and no surprises!
customer,fast & instant funding next day. thank you CashNetUSA
Sherrie,I wish I could rate with no stars. These people are robbers. Dont ever borrow from cashnet you're better off without them. They continue to add daily interest which they say just started in April 2020. During a pandemic when people are out off work. Makes no sense! You make a payment to lower your balance and then the next day it increases again. Almost like something that never ends. They dont want you to pay off they'd rather keep you in debt. Very frustrating and inappropriate.
Julie Stroud,I received a email to settle a loan with cash net usa or I will be taken to court. Ive never heard if this company and certainly never had a loan with them! So attention  SCAM ALERT!
JOSE,Why do you have to pay to get a loan
Robert,This company is such a racket do not use them. You can find better ways of accessing cash. They charged me over $450 to use $1700 for 17 days. I am reporting them to whatever agencies will listen to me. They are doing nothing but taking advantage of people who find themselves in a bad situation. Shame on them. After seeing the response? I just want to say that I have contacted your company and I was not satisfied with the response. I asked for a copy of the contract that I signed and I have not received it.
J Simin,I am submitting another bad review because I still cannot access my account. This is complete and utter BS. I cannot see how much I still owe nor how much my monthly payment will be. I feel as if this is illegal.  I used to love this company but not anymore.
harrison,Always there when I need them. 💯
Matthew,they were very patient and understanding about my situation and the way that I paid for my account I would recommend them to some of my friends
CLYDE,It was a very positive experience!  Customer Service was so fair and worked with me!
Anonymous ,"Very efficient, representative that helped me answered all my questions and stayed with me until I completed the process. Will definitely recommend."
Lucky,Great customer service needed help during COVID  and they were very helpful and friendly
Cradron,Always helpful & kind! Helped me through my financial situation with ease! Thanks!
Nena,It was easy and quick to do. Thanks
KENNETH,Thanks for a y’all help in my time of financial difficulties!
Stephanie,"It was fast, but as I'm counting my monthly payments, I'm paying more then 100% intrest, which means you have to pay double of your loan amount and it's alot. I won't recoment this for anyone."
Mary,So far I have had a very good experience with CashNetUSA.
GAYNELL,Cash Net always provides professional and accurate service. Any time lines are met with precise follow through each time.
DEBBIE,"Awful period... the interest is ridiculous you will never get finished paying them, when I’m done I wont be dealing with them again."
Patrick,"I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYBODY SAYS ABOUT CASH NET USA, I LOVE THEM AND THANK GOD FOR THEIR HELP WITH MY FINANCES!!!"
Paul,"I use  to love this company. A little expensive but okay. That is until they switch my loan from a payday loan to a line of credit. The line of credit adds interest to your account everyday depending on how much you borrow. My loan adds between 40 and 50 dollars daily for a month. By the time my payment comes out only a couple of dollars goes toward my loan, the rest is interest. With my payday loan I always made 4 payments and it was paid off. Do not except lines of credit.  If they don't do payday loans in your state please consider another way to get the money you need.  They are worst than loan sharks. I wish I had read the terms first  but I just assumed it worked like the payday loans. Been with them for years. I called a said I couldn't make my payment of 347.00 dollars so they told me I could pay 128.00. When payment came due, they charged me the 128.00 plus the 347.00. How was that for help. If I could afford the 347.00 why would they think I could afford 2 payments at once. That was almost 500.00. My account paid it and I had an over draft fee.PLEASE RECONSIDER YOUR OPTIONS BEFORE DEALING WITH THESE PEOPLE.  If it's a payday loan that's fine but PLEASE DON'T DO A LINE OF CREDIT. IT SHOULD BE ILLEGAL FOR THEM TO DO THIS."
Scott,I really didn’t expect to get help this fast like fr y’all. 😂😂 money’s on the way with cash net USA lol
Keaira,My experience was smooth and timely. Also far lower rates than the competitors. Very satisfied.
TERRY from South Carolina,Excellent company.  Quick and easy.  Ready to help when needed!
ANTOINETTE,Didnt expect it to be so fast! Thank you cashner Usa!
JENNIFER,It was very easy getting a loan but it has been a hassle trying to get logged in to check my account. I will not be using this company for future needs. Very unacceptable.
Maximo,"Always on time when needed. CashNet is my support group, very dependable. I love ❤️ them"
Clean Green,"Very helpful and answered my question with kindness, clarity, and professionalism."
Dominque,It was very quick and easy to get a withdrawal from my account. It only took a few steps
Ms. Gregory,payments broke down keep you paying more over time than structured payments. Makes perfect sense to keep a person on the hook. If you don't need a 300% interest loan don't do it!! I dont have any questions for you. I understood the interest rate i understand repayment what i did not understand is fluctuations in payment that didn't even cover the principle and then one that did I'm sorry but steady payment of the same cost across the board is kinda a practice that needs to be adopted by screwing you out of a lower payment to not even cover the principle at all is kinda a poor way to extend a loan well past the payoff time. Food for thought.
SUMMER,Thank you you were so quick to help I really really really appreciate it thank you so much
Valerie,Always there when I need you! Quick and easy
Thomas,It was fast and easy. The best rates that I found!
ANGEL,Everything was great!  I was only paying my bill so I did not speak to a representative.
Evelyn,"Love you guys you guys rock😊👍🏻, will let friends and family know. Have a blessed day."
Todd,The way to help me and every way and I'm getting my loan approved again it's my fourth loan with them and I'm very happy with you what's up Mom
Rene,Programs like this really make life easier thanks lots of us can't go in a bank and get a loan but yet they give us a checking account !!!
Teresa,I do think it was great talking with you
ESTELA,"Fast, friendly service"
Jawed,Have always found Cashnet reliable and easy to deal with.
M.M.,Cashnet has been there when we it the most and fast
Ruth B ,Too high of interest rates even for established accounts in good standing .
Sandra Legg,"I'll start with the positives first. . .The application process was super easy and the funds were deposited into my account the next business day!  Now for the real story. . . for the $1350 that I borrowed for an emergency, I have made $1300 in payments over the last 3 months and the balance is STILL $1377.  Needless to say, I will be making additional payments from now on with a goal to pay this thing off ASAP!!!  I would only recommend CashNetUSA as a LAST resort if you know that you will have a windfall of cash in the near future to pay them off because an APR of 299% means most of your payments are going to interest.  This type of predatory lending creates a cycle of debt that is very difficult to break."
Gary,"It was fast, safe and easy to request an advance."
Yvonne,Never had any problems in getting the loan and they are understanding. Thanks for your service.
Tommy,This company refused me a loan after I had several loans with them and paid them off. Never late on payments. Nothing has changed on my stuff but they still declined me. What company does business like this. So it dont matter if you are a good customer any more.
Melissa Rollins,I couldn't believe I sat right down done the application and within seconds I was approved. I really appreciate you guys because this came at a very needed time. I will definitely refer anyone to this site. Thanks Again CashNet😋
Dontay,You always be there.   Thankyou
Fay,"CASHNET HAS BEEN THERE FOR ME MANY TIMES. THEY ARE QUICK, COURTEOUS, AND MOST OF ALL FAIR.  REAL CLASS ACT!THANK YOU CASHNET USA."
BARRY,This company  does not help. you pay back 10 times more than what you receive even if you try and pay extra it takes your extra payments and doesn't apply it to you account. Sorry but not sorry!!!! Then once you talk with customer services they have  very nasty attitudes.
Belinda,HIGHWAY ROBBERS!!!! PLEASE DO NOT TAKE A LOAN OUT WITH THEM!!!
Johnetta Coutee Webster,Always friendly and good customer service.
YVETTE Angulo,"I DO NOT recommend using this loan company . This is a complete rip off . You pay way more back  than what you borrow . Its no point in even paying a minimum payment on the balance you borrow from , only 1/4 goes toward your balance . If you borrow from this scamming company you will be paying back your entire life . DONT make this mistake I made by borrowing from them , you will regret it ."
Maria,I recommend cashner to anyone they really help me out
CAROLYN,"Great service, it was right on time."
Harvey,Very good 👍The person was very good and helped me with my application
Blanca,Thank your company so much.  When I needed the help it was there.  In less than  36 hrs I had the money I needed to help me out.
Mary,"No way this many people can be happy with this company. Fake reviews, please read the negative reviews as well. Before agreeing to the terms make sure you read the terms carefully. It’s a 299% interest rate folks. 299%!!"
Shauntae Gipson,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE. THEY TAKE YOUR MONEY AND OVER CHARGE AND THEY'RE NO HELP. NEVER TAKE OUT A LOAN WITH THESE CLOWNS.I THOUGHT THEY WERE A GOOD COMPANY. BUT NO HORRIBLE. I CANT SAY THIS ENOUGH HORRIBLE.
Edward Clark,"I would not recommend  this business  ,to any trying to get a loan they prey on the most vulnerable  people.  THEY ARE  CROOKED LOAN SHOCKS   THEY WILL KEEP  YOU PAYING HIGH INTEREST  RATES ON THESE LOANS OF 400% OR HIGHER IN SOME STATE 1400 % INTEREST RATES YOU WILL  ALWAYS  BE OWING THEM AND WILL NEVER PAY THE LOAN OFF ITS  AN ENDLESS CYCLE  , THEY SHOULD BE SHUTDOWN  ,THERE  SHOULD NE CLASS ACTION  LAWSUIT  AGAINST  ,THIS BUSINESS  ITS HIGH ROBBERY , I  urge you not to borrow . URGEYOU"
JOHNNY,Love it awesome customer service ❤️
WILLIAM,Your company is awesome to work with!  Thannk you!
Lynn,Outrageous interest rate and payment setup that makes no sense. Do not make your situation worse by borrowing money from this company. Most of not all of the 5 star reviews are fake. This business prays on the poor and keeps you in the hole and in debt to them. If you can pay off your loan with them and go to a credit union. This company is setup to keep you making payment that do little to your principle balance because the interest rate is sky high. It should be illegal what they do but I’m sure some lobbyist has paid off senators to keep them in business. I got $1400 and when I started paying it off they lowered it to $1100 and said it was due to Covid. So at a time of crisis you lower my line of credit. Ended up paying back over $3000 in just 6 months and that was because I paid it off early. Not worth it. Please listen to my review and steer clear.
DALE,Fast. Got me out of a jam
Sherry,They are taking more from you than they are actually helping you. They putting you in more debt than what you started with before borrowing. The interest is being charged every single day of the billing cycle which is a complete RIP OFF. They add extra to the interest and it make it impossible to pay them off. THEY ARE BASICALLY LEGAL ROBBERS.
CashNetUSA Client ,I been with CashNetUSA for 5 years and never had any problems with them. I would recommend CashNetUSA to anyone whoever needs help on a loan. I understand how in these hard times during the coronavirus but they lower your amount they lend you but I understand that and I agree with y’all on during it. But I will not stop being a customer to y’all because I believe in y’all. Y’all help me in hard times we I needed y’all. So thank y’all very much. And still like I say I will still be y’all best customer. Thank you Grace
John Dosher,Thank egotism always helping me out when I need it!
Sudie,Easiest and most convenient way to get a short term loan
Pamela,"Cashnetusa has really helped me work through some financially challenging times following an expensive divorce and other unforeseen large bills. I cant recommend Cashnetusa enough to anyone who is good at budgeting and needs some extra cash quickly, that wont impact them negatively when it's paid back."
David,"I have to say, that CashNetUSA has saved me so many times in my everyday life.  They are great!  If not for them and their FABULOUS payday loans, I would have faced late bills!  Thank You for your company!  Have nothing but good to say about them!"
Darlene,"They aren’t worth 1 star.  Horrible company.  Trust me, you don’t need money that bad.  What they charge for repaying the Absolutely undoable.  And they tell you that they will give you extra time on a payment—nope, they tell you they cannot.  I cannot believe they are 4.5 stars.  I don’t know who they are getting to do their reviews."
Micho Arz,Absolutely the best company to deal with. I’ve been a customer for over 5 years now and I have NEVER had any issues with CashNetUSA. I highly recommend their services if you ever need them!
Yvonne,It's a great really fast gets straight to the point I only had minor issues with it
Fredrick Calhoun,"I have paid over $1400.00 in a months time on my loan. The information on Cashnet's portal is not kept current.They keep charging daily interest on the balance owed from the previous month. Trying to speak with any customer service they do not have the current information either. I have been told 3 different answers why my account was not current. It takes 2, 3, 4, business day's for Cashnet's system to clear a payment. In checking my account my last payment in the amount of $4270.00 has not posted as of 5/27/2020, payment was made on 5/15/2020. My account was behind due to the loss of work due to the corona viruse. payment arrangements were made. I caught my  account up on 5/8/2020. Their system did not see the account was current , so on 5/20/2020 their system took out a $99.00 payment. This after paying $1300.00 in a months time. For get about trying to get a hold of any live supervisor. and if you call in and you're over 50 you get connected to a solicitation for life alert not a live customer service rep. I will never use Cashnet nor would I recommend Cashnet. according to my accounting, and I run my own small business, cashnet owe's me because they have taken more than I owe,"
Debra Glosson ,I have had 3 different loans with CashNet. Very efficient and trustworthy!  They helped me out when in need!!!!!  Thank you!
Marline,Low on cash...money in account next day
Jeannie,Great when you need just a little extra cash. Has come in handy many times...
Mindy,They use to have loans up to $600 but not no more with no reason why.  I have used them for 2 years and never missed a payment.  Not Happy.
Customer Service ,"From day one , your staff has been professional, knowledgeable and extremely helpful. Having to borrow is never desirable, but Cashnet makes the process as pleasant as possible.  Thanks for your help 👍!!!"
Sherie,It's never been this easy to get a loan. The money is usually in your account the same day if not the next day. I'll reccomend this company to family and friends.
LIA,It was a easy to get get what I needed. Thanks
Marco,"Fast, reliable & Easy to apply. 👍"
MILDRED,Got money easy and very quickly very happy customer as of now
Leo Armidano,Your associate answered all of my questions
RAYMOND,"Please take heed to what I’m about to say! If you need money and have the means to pay it back in full within 2 weeks,  then by all means do it. But the reality is people who need money are not in a position to pay it back in full. This company preys on the low income people because they know they can’t pay it right back. This loan is meant for repayment within a few weeks to keep from getting those ridiculous customary fees. It should be against the law to charge the amount this company charges. My customary fees are over $10 per day plus $1.00 of interest per day. It’s outrageous! You can’t pay towards the original balance, it doesn’t work that way. If you pay more, it’s eaten up by the high customary fees. Just pay it in full and be done with them."
Tina,"This company is horrible to borrow a loan from. What they don’t tell you is for $100 borrowed they add on $15. On top of that you gain interest every single day to the remaining balance. My loan was $850. After the additional $15 it was about $985. I have already paid $1075.15 back. But due to the amount increasing by 0.8192% every single day I still have to pay $742 back. That amount will increase every day until my next payment date I set up with automatic payments. DO NOT GET A LOAN FROM HERE. I make 2 payments every month and it’s never a flat amount, each time the amount I am paying is different from the time before. This company is a total scam. Do not fall for the reviews on their site. I’ve asked a customer service rep for help explaining this process and they did everything to try and avoid my questions by repeating the same thing over and over and then had the audacity to ask if I could pay the remaining balance today. If I could why the heck would I have taken out a loan?!"
Joseph,"Beware! This company doesn't deserve one star! Apparently my account has been under review and when it's ""under review"" you cannot access it but in the meantime they continue to charge me interest fees and late fees. Their  customer service has the worst attitudes. Please do not do business with this company.  Shady is an understatement!"
Nicole,High interest loans. You pay so much more back. So make extra payments. I will NEVER take a loan out with cashnetusa again. Two representatives gave me misinformation leading to a surprise charge when this whole time I thought the loan was paid in full. Customer support and their representatives are useless.
Pamela,"This is the most horrible thing I have ever done in regards to receiving a loan. I know now I am a sucker and did not read my contract carefully. Companies like this should be SHUT DOWN!  They take advantage of people in need. This is my story- I borrowed 2000 and realize now I will pay back over 3500. Of course, it will be less if I can pay back more each month. I can't do this so therefore, I will pay over 3500.The interest rate is outrageous. Read carefully and Please do not use this company or any other one like it!! You will regret it! I hope this helps anyone thinking about using this company!!"
Kay,"They have  ALWAYS had exceptional customer service each and everytime  I have reached out especially when I had concerns of being able to make the full payment on time.  I went with them when I was in a bind. Did I pay way more than I should have to get the money I soo terribly needed more than once? Absolutely but they definitely do not blindside you about that.  So for everyone whining about how much you had to pay, pay closer attention next time to every detail.  People concerned about getting an interest rate decrease because of Covid? Did your house note or car note drop your interest rate? No, so why do you expect any difference? I am thankful to be paying mine off,  however if I needed this service again,  Cashnetusa would be one of top choices.  Thank you for terrific customer service esp during some scary times!"
GS,Great job just keep up the great experience professional job and super costumer services
Pastor David McEwen,"You guys are great,but I had a pre approved card 17FBD833 but was only approved for 500$"
Linda,I have nothing but very good dealings with CashNetUSA.  They have always help me with a short term loan when I needed it the most.  I have great respect for  CashNet USA and thee helpful staff.
Michelle,I paid them off and they still charged my account 4 days later . Made me over draw my account. No fun.....
Francisco,I've had nothing but really great service from cashnetusa
Jessica,Terrible!! Don't get suckered into this! Needed money for a family medical emergency and the quick loan helped but solving one problem created five more! In four months of paying every two weeks I have paid back the loan but with the insane interest all the money I've paid has barely touched the balance. Every penny has gone towards interest! This is terrible! Save yourself from making the same mistake I made by taking this loan!!!
Lolo Lopez,"I would not recommend Cashnet., only because with the interest rate of 299% they have been paid over the value of my orginal credit line. Right now I'm paying over 200 dollars and they charge 168 dollars interest for the month. I have had my credit line over a year. They have always been professional and while I needed the money this type of credit line in the end becomes a greater debt than the orginal reason for my request. I would highly recommend a traditional loan and if you can't get one borrow from family and pay them back. Exhaust all your possibilities before considering a credit line even if you have bad credit. If it weren't for the ridiculous 299% interest rate they would other wise be fine. In addition in light of COVID 19 you'd think the company with all the money they have made would bring the interest down to a traditional one to help their customers instead they reduce the credit line line which isn't horrible but the monthly cost still...is outrageous. Please look at your options before coming to this company. The people who own this company are not generous, this is purely business and they are not a life line to your financial problems.,this is business and you need to seriously consider that when looking for money for a short term problem."
Bill Sefcek,"I am a disabled veteran and am pretty sure my government check is too little to do business with this company. the commercial tells everyone het don't do credit scores, but I risked my life for USA it would be nice for some respect. Thet told me on tnhe phone for privacy sake they cannot tell me what I need to do to do business with them.t"
Ole Joe Brady,I have used them recently since the COVID-19 and they were very friendly and if I was late with the payment there as no extra charge. I am trying to get another again as times have got hard but not sure if I was approved it. I will update if I was or date. As I know it is rough right now and the little extra can go a long way even for just food. As long as it was approved again this time even after 2 week late payment then Excellent it is!!!
Chynna,"I actually called into CashNetUSA to report a suspicious call that I received and since I had actually applied for a loan not all that long ago I figured eh why not ask about it.And I had been approved for a $500 Line Of Credit! They helped walk me through the process of updating some of my information and I could've taken a draw on my line of credit ranging from $50 min. up to $500 maximum. I asked to receive $250 to my bank account and in a matter of hours, it was in my account all on the same day.Thank you CashNetUSA"
Daisy,"I was in a tough situation and borrowed money from this lender in Jan 2020! I wish I never had! Their interest rates are horrible! I have made 3 payments so far and my balance is still extremely high! I don't recommend this lender to anyone! Stay far, far away! I can't wait until my loan is paid off! I will NEVER EVER GO BACK TO THEM AGAIN! A very unhappy customer!"
donna,She was very professional and cared about my concerns and help to resolve my issues. Great
"Manolito-Overland Park,KS","It was fast, easy, and satisfactory by far! I'm still just waiting on my approved advance to be deposited into my bank account, hoping it does asap! Other than not knowing when the money will be deposited, I was unbelievably pleased with everything and will use them from here on out if I need alittle financial assistance! Thanks!"
Sonya,Cashnet is a great company with easy use.
TRACY,I liked that I got approved I just need to know when I'm going to have access to my credit line
Harriet Mason,EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE...........THANK YOU FOR YOUR KINDNESS DURING COVID-19..I APPRECIATE ALL YOUR HELP
Myra,I have nothing but good things to say about CashNetUSA I was approved the very next day I been a customer for over a year now at this point I’m a regular they never give me any problems  they are very reasonable
Linda,My experience was wonderful I would highly recommend Cashnet USA if your looking for a quick loan..
TONYA,These are  people are so easy to deal with ..thank young or  a great experience.
katrina,"CashNetUSA is perfectly up front with their fees and interest. If you are unhappy with the agreement they offer you, don't borrow money from them. My hunch is people are so desperately need money they do not fully read the agreement and they feel like they are being taken advantage of. I know what I'm getting into every time I apply for a loan with CashNetUSA. They are up front, honest and have a very strong Customer Service team."
K.T.,"NEVER USE THIS COMPANY Their interest and fees for borrowing money are outrageous. I am a mentally disabled person and truly didn't understand what I was getting into. I tried seeking help from this company to get help paying them off with a social security check coming in monthly and they would offer no help at all, just saying that I signed the contract to deal with it.  I would NEVER suggest anyone to borrow from this company unless you're rich enough to pay them off before the due date and pay their fee and interest for the amount you borrow in full the first month. Otherwise you get yourself into a vicious cycle where the is no light at the end of the tunnel. Again, DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY."
CHRISTINA,"Smooth,  quick and easy get done"
Carla,"Very helpful, enjoy their service thanks for helping when in need."
marlene hatfield,"This is criminal practice. I took out a loan for 1700.00. I just paid it off and the grand total was over $4000.00! If you need cash, my advice would be to pay it off IMMEDIATELY!."
Julie,Whole process was easy and money was in the bank next day
Danny R,"Wow who are you people  you may be stupid 299 percent interest with fee  , if you borrow 2000 you may never be able to eat for 8 months"
Nasser,We missed the cut off time by 10 min for same day deposit
D. Crank,"Easy process , friendly service ."
SANDRA,Give me loan when others wouldnt. It came fast. I would go throw you again.
Francisco Ramirez,Great service very satisfied.Customer service was very helpful and very courteous.
Roy,"BUYER BEWARE!!!  Understand that your interest rate is per day, so if you have a balance of say 1675.00, the interest on that can accrue upwards of 177 - 180 for a 2 week period, which means you are practically paying about 500 a month, and very little of it goes towards paying off your principle.  So unless you can pay off that amount immediately or borrow less than 200., IT IS NOT WORTH IT!!!!"
Alex PhatJuice,Complete scam never open a credit with them. They say they are lenders but actually they are big time scammer.
Lajander,"I used their services many times. Since the Covid-19 started I somehow was only approved for a smaller amount.  Which makes no sense because my bank status, credit, and income never changed.     I'm blessed to be able to work from home.  They have no explanation about why for the first time my approved amount is much less.  I found a new cash advance company to work with instead."
Fay,It paid my bills for a month time Thank you
Julia,"The customer service person I spoke with was very helpful in helping me understand all the fees and what exactly I had to do to request money.  He was so nice and very knowledgeable of the company and answered all my questions without hesitation.  The only thing I did not like was the percentage rate.  However, when your credit score is not the best and you need help to cover household expenses while your husband is laid off from work due to COVID19, they were there to help me and I appreciate that!!"
Lee Danzey,"Very unprofessional. I overpaid the balance showing on thier website by more than $100. After showing my payments my new balance was over $200. How does $822 minus $1016 equal $216? I called to get some answers. The first rep had no idea what she was doing but was nice and clearly put into a position without proper training. After not being able to answer that math question she said her supervisor would call me. Before I go on note that interest is charged daily. The next day (there was around 6 hours left in the curent day) around 10:00 AM I get a call from Alana the manager while I was with a client of my own. I asked if I could call her back. Maybe 30 min later I call. I am told she would call me right then. She didn't return my call that day. I called again asking why no call. I'm told she would call me in ""less than an hour"". Still no call. Today she calls. Understand that I don't really care for my given first name and have gone by my middle name for about 45 years. After I point out this fact Alana, or as I shall refer to as Lucy, calls me by first name every time she speaks and tells me that she has to. That's just the rudest thing I have ever heard of. Back to the point. Lucy tells me that I should have taken a screenshot of the web page showing the $822 balance and since I didn't have that she wouldn't do anything. So I am left with having to pay over $200 more plus $5 of interest charged while waiting for Lucy to do nothing. I knew going in that this was a high cost loan but it was a 90 day turnaround that I was ok with. I had no idea that I was going to get gouged and treated like crap.Don't use CashnetUSA!ALLEN"
BRANDON ,"I was able to easily get a loan from Cashnet. And the process to receiving the funds is easy. I realize that this is a company that helps those in need with not the best credit score. And if you need a small amount, and can pay it back quickly, it's ok. But, dont be fooled by the bi weekly payments.  Very little of this money is used towards your principal. DO NOT MAX OUT YOUR LOAN!! My issue with this company is the lack of training they provide to their employees.  No one can explain why your balance is what it is, which leads me to believe that Cashnet currently has some possible fraudulent activity going on. CASHNET IS NOT BBB ACCREDITED. When Covid-19 hit, Cashnet immediately decreased everyone's actual approval amount. This company does not care about being there in your time of need, nor do they care about their customers. SHAME ON THE CEO, AL GOLDSTEIN, AND HIS SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM! Fortunately,  I  was able to pay my loan off quickly, and did not suffer as most have from their dealings with this company. Times are hard, especially right now. But you'd be better off getting a payday loan, at least you know what you're paying."
Diane,Never will I get another loan from these people . Customer service sucks and my dollar amount goes up like 4$ a day that the loads not completely paid up . It’s ridiculous they could care less about people
Tammy,My experience was great I should have call CashNetUSA a long time ago. Thanks I look forward to many years of doing business with CashNetUSA
LIZ,"This is a Trash company They are a fraudulent company, and I took a line of credit $1500  and had to pay $3000 in less than 20 days. they keep increasing interest in 8 hours never and never tell you about there policy, I almost paid them double.  they charge you $220 fee for the first time when you open an account with this trash company warns.  find another place to get a loan. cashnetis fraudulent and exists only they keep you in debt. I don't want any reply from this trash company . all there 5 start rating is fake"
EDWARD,"These 5 star reviews are FAKE. They are fraudulent and the truest definition of loan sharks. With a 325% interest rate, you'll never ever pay your debt to them. You can make a payment towards your balance and they apply it to the ridiculous interest even if you want to put it towards the principal. Poor people in a bind look towards these kinds of companies for quick money but it is NOT worth dealing with. You'll be in an endless circle of debt that you'll never get out of. I paid $400 towards my line of credit and my balance went UP. At that point, im the fool for even signing the contract. This is a warning. FIND ANOTHER PLACE TO GET A LOAN. CASHNET IS FRAUDULENT AND EXISTS ONLY TO KEEP YOU IN DEBT. I DO NOT WANT A REPLY FROM THIS TRASH COMPANY EITHER. I DO NOT CARE WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY. MY ACCOUNT IS CLOSED FOR GOOD."
Tamara Sparkman,"This place is very crooked.  Don’t borrow money from them. You will regret it. If I could have given them negative stars, I would have."
Patricia,"It did ok in a pinch but dealing with them is a major pain. Website is glitchy and unreliable, customer service reps are unhelpful, uncommunicative, secretive and cagey. They make it impossible to process basic updates on your account. Trying to get receipts or documents takes forever and getting honest answers takes even longer.Nah, not going to contact your “dedicated customer service line” and be put through your nonsense again. The only thing you’re “dedicated” to is BS."
Leon,"I don't understand, how do people give Cashnetusa 5star rating when they screw you so hard? I would recommend new customer, please don't use their service. I took line of credit $800 and had to pay $1500 in less than 20 days. They keep increasing interest in 8hours. I should've taken other company's line of credit."
Barry,The person that gave me help is wonderful.
Chasity,My experience was fantastic with Cashnet. Fast and easy approval and funding.
Charles,"This is a crooked place to take a loan from. I would advise you not to, but I had no options. It doesn't matter how much you pay down as you still pay the interest rate based on taking out the complete loan. Mine was a $1,000$ loan. Every day it added 8-10$ to the principle. I paid down 200$ towards it and same amount each day. I paid another hundred towards it a day later and same amount put back on the card each day. It's down to 776$ this past Sunday and I look at it now and it's back up to 826$. That's a crooked rate but they can do that because of how POS the place is. I put down 300$ more towards it but will just pay the thing off with my next check and never come back to them. There are laws in place that protect consumers from BD interest rates like this but I guess that doesn't apply to this type of company. It's the reason why they don't report to credit agencies. It's very shady and if I were you I'd sell something or put something you own up for collateral at a bank. This is the old mafia way of doing business. That's my honest review. I had no where to go and they helped me out so without options they take advantage of you. Such is life, right?"
Becky,"I have been a long time customer. I feel that they are deceptive at best. When a person makes a draw, they are not given a chance to know or agree to payments! You dont know until after making the draw, then once the payments are set, I contacted CS and was given a one time breakdown of one payment, in addition to my scheduled payment which would have been more! When I told the rep that, he said ""I'm sorry I couldn't make you happy. Is there anything else that I can help you with!!"""" Just like that, no empathy or anything! This is how long time customers are treated! I feel clients should be made aware of the payments before they submit to give them a chance to decline,  it's not fair and immoral,  and deceptive!"
Wayne,Cashnetusa is awesome the whole process is super fast. From step one to the money being deposited was very fast. Thank you cashnetUSA
Angela,We needed a little extra cash to tide us over through part of this pandemic. CashNetUSA quickly reviewed our application and deposited the funds into our account. It was truly appreciated!
SUSAN GOWEN,Fast and efficient service. The funds were actually in my account before I received formal notice of approval via email!
Sharon R. Nagy,Great job guys!
Aaron,"Worst ever I ask for help my hours got short couldn’t make a payment they asked me if I could make it the following day or I ask someone to borrow money to pay no help no nothing never miss a payment ,1500 loan still paying since 12-12-2019"
Sherry,I had a great experience the accountant I talk to were vey helpful and concerned about my financial problem and my pet
Robin Yarbrough,I didn't even get to put in an amount before being denied nothing. I think that is stupid that you have a person fill out an app and don't know their expected amount being requested. Fix your method. And your tv advertisement is a LIE.THANK YOUI'm not going to try again. It's a waste of time the second round.
CLIFTON,"F these people. Applied a got denied and said my credit was too low when I know it’s not then I check and it says it pulled it from some unknown credit agency and said my credit score was 300 points lower than my fico and other scores. My wife is with them however and paid her loan today and went to reloan because we NEED the 255 because times are hard with this PANDEMIC but what do they do, they lower everyone’s limit to 100 because of the pendemic when other companies are extending dates and waiving fees this pos company lowers and screws people over, this says a lot about this company and I would advise never to go to this place WAAAAY better options out their that don’t ruin your credit."
Dion,I am completely satisfied with everything . I can't believe how easy and quick it was . Thank you
Alejandro,"Do not get a line of credit (loan) with CashnetUSA, unless you can pay back the entire amount within the next 30 days. It's a rip off geared toward the poor. Yes, it is fast cash. Yes, it is there when you need it most. Is the stress worth it? No. You will be paying so much cash back, that you will resent yourself for ever getting it."
Christina,Very bad. Minimum payment high and always increasing biweekly.
General,"DO NOT USE CASHNET!! As a return customer, with an account paid off EARLY and in good standing, not 1 but 2 representatives lied to me about when and how I paid off my account, and when I could receive funds! They took my last $80 and have left my family with no money, no food, etc for 4 days during the Coronavirus outbreak. I have learned my lesson! So disappointed with this company! Please don't be as foolish as me. I just had nowhere else to turn!"
Clarrissa,"I would NOT recommend CashNetUSA to anyone. They tell you they dont go off your credit report. I make $135,000 per year with copies of the last 7 months of my paychecks at the same job ive been at for 3.5 years. I have a checking account with bank of America and an email address wich is the only things they say you need to get a loan and I was turned down for any amount of a loan including $250. My credit score is 550. The only reason they would turn me down is because of my low credit score that they say they dont go off. Stay away from cashnetusa unless you have a great credit score and you just want to pay an ungodly high APR. They also told me they would call my employer to verify I worked there and in that process would let them know that I applied for a loan. That shouldn't be any of my employer's business.  Stick with traditional loans."
David F.,"Yep, there we go - now I got my own cookie-cutter response.  Dear CashNet:  You suck.  I have used Loanatlast and they are MUCH more straightforward than you.  There are tons of better alternatives than you out there."
REBECCA,"This company has really lost its mind!  They may have been great once, but they aren't anymore.  Exceptionally poor record keeping, customer service is there, but they can't answer any questions so they are next too useless.  My wife and I were using them for short term, and out of the blue without any cause, they actually reduced our credit availability without any previous notification.  We hadn't missed a payment or anything, they just did it!  Absolutely nuts!!If you can find other means to finance your needs other than CashNetUSA, I would highly recommend avoiding this firm, as a company you can rely on to be there when you need them, CashNetUSA is not that firm!!"
Shedrick S,They lied to me they said the first payment would be around 200 then it would drop in the low 100 hundreds but they never told me that my interest  rate was going to be 300% they also were taking about 250 out every other week they dont care about the coronavirus  I missed 1 payment and they added 400 dollars to my account they dont care about us I'll be writing several reviews and having other people to do the same dont use them they only care about ripping you off until my next review dont borrow Jackie trusty
Dee Dee,"Hated Them when I first started, How could you do this, You want me to pay how much back!!! Being my first time ever taking out a loan, I was in total disbelief! Now America, I have to say CashNetUSA is one of the most TRUSTWORTHY entities for borrowing money! They are Upfront NO BULL Service! CashNetUSA Customer Service is AWESOME! So helpful going above and beyond to work with you America to make your payments on time! I Have to say America They Have Made A Once shocked newcomer into a person who cant stop telling everyone THIS IS YOUR GO TO COMPANY for a loan! I Love You Guys, Thanks CashNetUSA ..."
BELINDA,I was extremely disappointed to find that my line of credit was reduced after being with cashnet so long.  This has always been a reliable backup for emergencies but this has made me realize that I can't count on this anymore so I won't. You pay to much in fees to get such a reduction when there has never been an issue with my payment.
Connie,I was certainly pleased with the service that you apply to me I think you
john,Thank u for send me quick money to the bank
Brian,"This company is the Worse the Interest Rates are Terrible. I Borrowed 1,000 from the back in December. My payments are between $160-170 every two weeks and out of that only $49 goes toward my actual loan and the rest goes to interest. These People are a total RIP off and on top of that they had the nerve to decrease my credit limit. This is the sorriest company that I have ever dealt with and Will NEVER deal with the Money Hungry Company Again.Nor Will I Recommend this Poor Company to anyone.. THIS COMPANY IS PATHETIC"
Deborah,many people is out of work because of the coronavirus and many bank  and credit card company is stopping all interest rate and allowing their customer to miss 2-3 payment with no penalty.NOT CASHNETUSA OR CASHFROMUS.I CALL AND ASK FOR HELP BECAUSE I GOT LAID OFF. ALL THEY SAID WAS WE WILL GIVE YOU 2 MONTH BUT THE HIGH INTEREST WILL CONTINUE AND YOUR BALANCE WILL GO UP. WHAT A SAD COMPANY. THEY EVEN HAVE THE WORD USA ON THE END OF THEIR NAME BUT ONLY CARE ABOUT THE MONEY AND NOT THEIR CUSTOMER.CANT WAIT TO GET AWAY FOR CASHNET USA
Carolyn,CashNetUSA is great to work with.They came to my rescue lol!
WILLIAM,Very helpful in all areas of customer service
Marian Stefan,"I've been a customer for a while and had no issues until I received my email about lowering credit limits during our world crisis.  Where other companies are handling things much differently, they felt it necessary to LOWER limits on good standing customers.  I think it says a lot about a company and how they deal with the crisis and I would never recommend this company after this experience.  No warning, no criteria, no reason....completely inappropriate response to their customers."
Marilyn Garcia ,They made everything quick and simple which I appreciate had my money the next day highly recommend
Rashida,"While everyone else is forgoing payments or interest , they are lowering your credit amount (not that I would ever use them again due to their horrid interest rate) just thought very poor taste to thing only of themselves when every other creditor is reaching out to help. No class Cashnet"
Kristina,Quite possibly the BEST COMPANY currently existing of any kind right now!
Pamela Borrell,I used to think this was a great company until this pandemic hit! Other companies are giving at least 60 days of not having to worry about a payment but not this one! They're over drafting people's accounts trying to get their money when people jobs have shut down due to this virus! Shows they don't care about their customers!
Virginia,"“In light of the current circumstances related to the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) and our commitment to making responsible lending decisions, we have taken the precautionary measure of adjusting certain credit limits. On 03/20/2020, your credit limit was changed from $1,000 to $650.”So essentially, when people need loans the MOST, your company reduces the borrowing limit. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. They are EXTREMELY unethical and take advantage of their customers."
BENJAMIN,Cashnet really helped me out in this time of need!
Jacqueline Keys-Guidry,"This company is a rip off!I'm not stupid but I was taken in by how quick and helpful they were when I needed it.  Boy, I did not read the fine print good enough.  I live on a fixed income and now I owe more per month then I know what to do about.  I'm going to have to ask my daughter for a loan to get out from under this loan.  Don't put yourself through this or get an attorney to read you the conditions."
KAMORU,"Very concice instructions, very quick responses, very helpful Q&A."
LeeOtis,Very true to your advertisement...I will recommend your service
Linda Damitz,"Your company was one of the most professional ones that I have ever done business with this year.  The young men that helped me were courteous, professional, knowledgable, and very, very helpful.  They answered all of my questions, both times that I phoned.  Based upon them and the excellent services that I received, I will be doing business with this lender for many, many years to come, and recommend CashNetUSA to several of my close friends and family members.  Thank you, thank you, thank you, and thank you again.  You all really helped me out of a financial bind during these trying times."
KAJ,"I have borrowed from CashNet on and off for several years, always thankful that i could get the money i needed regardless of the SUPER high interest. Now, when i need the help most because i got furloughed yesterday, i get an email today saying my credit limit has been cut significantly. I've been a good customer and this is the kind of treatment i get. I will NEVER use this company again and recommend that those of you looking for a loan find another company"
Greg Baker,"“In light of the current circumstances related to the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) and our commitment to making responsible lending decisions, we have taken the precautionary measure of adjusting certain credit limits. On 03/20/2020, your credit limit was changed from $1,400 to $900.”So essentially, when people need loans the MOST, your shady company reduces their borrowing limit. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY FOR LOANS. They have an EXTREMELY high interest rate, and everything they do is designed to lure you into giving them more and more money. They KNOW exactly what they’re doing. Do not be fooled!"
Shamira,"I requested a grace period on my loan due to not being able to work because of this COVID-19 situation and I was told that I could do so as long as I signed and returned the notice to delay payment form ON OR BEFORE the original due date, which I did. I received an e-mail after the fact stating that I didn’t do so in time and that they were still taking the payment out of my account. I contacted customer service via phone and e-mail and I was told that I would hear back from them. It’s been two business days and I still haven’t heard from them. My account is now messed up and I will have to pay NSF and Overdraft fee’s because of them because they want to mislead and miscommunication with the very people who keep them in business. Definitely not dealing with them after this is settled. Also, forcing people to do credit counseling in order to get an extension during this pandemic is extremely anal retentive and tone deaf. You guys know good and well what the impact of this virus is on an economic level. Credit counseling is not about to fix that."
Timothy,Customer service.Is DecentEasy to get Funds.YesCredit check No will not hurt your credit Interest RATESTERRIBLE HIGH DAILY INTEREST ON LOANS VERY HIGH INTEREST RATES
Dave,I am unable to access what exactly is my payment and for how long the payments will be made for.I would also like to know about prepayment this information should be forthcoming
Matthew Russell,"Always fast and reliable. Cashnetusa is great because we all struggle and need help at times, now more than ever with what's going on with the covid 19 and I know I can trust them. Always great service too. :)"
KeystoneBrazil,You guys were great! Thank you so much for giving me a chance when others wouldn’t!
Sara,The service was fast and efficient got my funds tight away
TINA,nice courteous and helpful and knowledgeable
DWAYNE,"Thank you all so much you have truly been appreciated especially now during the coronavirus crisis, the extra money help me  to meet the needs for me and my four granddaughter.

Bernadette,Good website Just got Approved Looks good until now
Katherine,Quick and easy. No hassle.
KELON,Over the guy I talked to was good. Had a little trouble with hearing every word as he talked fast at some points of our conversation.
JAMES,Amazing site. I was so pleased by everything done.
Lisa,"Great fast cash, but the down side to it is that they really dont discuss the apr rate, terms, how to pay back, nor the total balance due. They kind of just give u an amount a it's like zap your stuck. That's crappy business. Other than that they are awersome an really fast. They should really have a break down of all stated above."
cjf,"Fast, easy, representatives were able to answer all of my concerns. Very professional"
Robert ,Love this company. They are very helpful and professional. I would reccomend highly to my friends. Thank you for your excellent services.Rufina
Kevin Winston,Why did you send me a email stating that I was  approved .that's  bull s###           why would any company send approved litter then so no? I won't waste anymore of my time
Marilyn,"WILL NEVER TAKE ANOTHER LOAN OUT AGAIN WITH THIS COMPANY! NEVER RECEIVED THE PROMOTIONAL CREDIT! WHEN I CALLED IN THEY SAID THEY COULDN'T HONOR IT. CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS NOT FRIENDLY ABOUT THE SITUATION, MY 2ND LOAN WITH THEM AND WILL BE MY LAST!!!!"
Jennifer,Very quickly done and did not have to wait
Joan,Said they could help no matter the credit or anything and they couldn't help me for squat now I'm losing everything. Thanks CashNetUSA for your B.S.
NICKAI,Very easy and fast! Definitely grateful for the ability to get a loan with not great credit but in need at this time because of unexpected expenses.  Thank you for being so fast and efficient.
Belsie,"The person I talked to was, curtious ,perfessional ,and she helped me through the whole process on my laptop!"
Kimberly,the only thing is that I never saw how much I have to pay back and when. I hope Im good till the 23rd
Rosemary  valdez,I was happy how fast I was approved and got my money the next day!
Marla,Worst company ever. They over charge on the repayment. They charge interest every day. I've paid 500 on a 600 loan and they still say I owe 600.....never will I use them or recommend them ever again. Scamming as company.!!!!
Bernard,"Already posted a review on this sub-par service, but they sent me an email and wanted another one.If you actually read the email, if you click the ""thumbs down"" it doesn't take you here to leave a review, they have you take an internal survey. However, if you click the ""thumbs up"" they want you to leave a review. This is blatant review manipulation, on top of all the fake accounts posting 5 star reviews. Avoid this company like the plague."
customer  KAY MURIEL,"Very friendly staff, and they were able to expedite the loan the same day!   The interest rate is absorbent, but they were there for me when others said NO!"
TIMOTHY,Very easy and extremely helpful. Thank you
Christopher,"Fast, easy , simple ... Great job guys!!"
Arthur Miller,Great experience. Thanks
PAULA OROPEZA,This was one of the fastest and easiest opportunities after being denied to navigate through and get what I need to get back on track
Chauntel,"Fast and friendly service, thank you."
RON,Once I sent all my information over it was great and easy
Vinnie Carpenter,I regret I got loan from cashnetusa when I was in need I would never recommand this company or cadhnetusa to anybody I paid triple of the amount I own you. Ca c est du vol je regrette who wvwr speed french my cousin told me I didn't believe it judt happened to me good luck to who ever saying good things about you.
Chance,It was easy for me to get the money when I needed it Thank you so much
Yvonne,Wonderful experience quick and fast service
Adrian,They were fast and to the point had a awesome experience about out to the lady that assisted me
Ross Jones,Don’t do it. Interest is wayyyy to high.
John Betts,Excellent customer service on the phone. Prompt processing. Helpful payment plans. The best loan agency I've dealt with to date.
Grady,Excellent. Everyone was very helpful and patient. Thank you for providing help when it was needed.
Sandra Masterson,"LISTEN TO THE BAD REVIEWS!!! This company is highly NOT recommended. Every time I called, the representatives gave the wrong information. I called in to make an early payment AND made a larger payment and this company still drafted the payment due for that week. The interest charges change by the day. I borrowed $800 in November and here we are in March, and I paid $900.00 yesterday to repay the full loan. If the loan isn't paid off in full, you WILL continue to owe CashNet USA for a long time. It got so bad, I wanted to get a loan from my bank to pay CashNet off. This company is not my first, second or even my tenth choice for loans. The money comes faster because the repayments take longer to repay. Don't do it!!!"
CINDY,It was easy and fast to borrow money from cash net. However the interest rate and payment is extremely high. On a $1500.00 loan the payments were over $550 a month in which $386.00 went solely towards interest. I made a loan with another company just to pay Cashnet off. Within 4 months I had paid over $1300.00 in interest. Not worth it.
Marian,"Was approved for a loan at 6:35 am CT 3/9/20. According to their own service representatives and their website, this loan should have been transferred to my bank by the end of the day. By late that night my ACH transfer was not even showing up as pending in my account. I talked to a representative at 9:31 pm CT of that same night, and they could see nothing wrong with my ACH transfer, and was told to call back in the morning, since they have until 11:59 pm to post. It is now 7:45 am CT 3/10/20 and the funds are still not even pending in my account. I gave them a call back trying to figure out what is going on; and apparently their system is so f*cked that it took the bank account information I had input CORRECTLY, and changed it to the last for digits of my account (which wasn't even entered, as their system doesn't allow the ""-"" key to be entered. My account number looks lik XXXXXXXXX-0001 or -0002.. the last 4 digits are to distinguish savings and checking).So now, not only are the funds not sent to my account, I have to wait until 3/11/20 for them to receive the money back, and only then can I attempt to fix their mistake and attempt to get the loan I needed on the 9th.Don't bother with this company, their website is set up poorly ( the timezone of the site doesn't match the timezone they are actually in and use... their system auto corrects banking information to the point it won't actually transfer), and they can't even help you when their system makes a mistake.By the time this would get sorted out, I will have gotten my actual paycheck, and already have to pay late fees, so this service offered me nothing but a waste of my time and energy.Now I'm sure since this is a 1 star review they're going to copy and paste an auto response to this comment. They cannot help you."
Dean,Thank u .Will recommend u to others.
armando,"This Company is by far the best easy to obtain a loan,  and the only one I know that you gain back available credit as you pay,  so I give them 2 thumbs up.Ken"
Quentin,Excellent service 👌Quick and easy Very professional
Walker Michael Evans,"Would not recommend!!! Yes you get money fast with next day deposit but I got 1,000 and I’ve paid well over 1,000 back in just 3 months and still owe over 900 which goes up everytime I make a payment!! I read some bad reviews and still fell into it!! Don’t be like me!!!"
Mary,"These people are Robbers of your innocent people and money! I got a loan for$600, They have already got me for over a  $1000 and still want more than that to pay it back. Plus you tell them that you don't have the money to pay for the next payment, They don't care about it even if you don't have any money in your account. They steal it from you!! Don't go here for anything! I'm a level 7 Google Guide for Maps , These guys will not be recommend."
Robert,"Got approved for 2000 Money on the way. Check this. I doordash so there is no limit to how money I can make lolz so guess what? I can pay the loan off in a month or so and keep it moving. I'm going to pay 500 a week and I make 700 a week. Easy. Thanks for that lump sum guys haha. I'd advise if u have a car and can't pay your payments, get a side gig and use your car. I'm tryna save lives here. The resources are there just play your cards right"
Cynthia,Quick and professional outstanding service would use them time and time again!
Carmen Rollins,So far everything has been simple enough.
Gladys,Fast fast fast. These people do what they say they're going to do.
Ace,"The process was easy, concise, clear and very efficient. I would recommend your service to anyone that needs a fast friendly loan."
lori,I would like to talk more about when my payments are due.
Natasha Carter,"Everone i dealt with was kind, helpful and knew their job well"
Javier,"I wouldn't recommend CashNetUSA to anyone! Their ""discount codes"" they send never work that THEY send. Also, when their ""system has issues"" an entire week and they still can't figure out what is happening with it they just provide you with an ""I'm sorry"". I have gone through multiple weeks with issues with the discount codes, got down to my final day to file an extension because of their system issues, was provided a confirmation that my extension was approved, then the day after my final day to file an extension they supposedly send an email that I never received (probably their system issues) that said my extension couldn't be processed allegedly then continued to charge my account the entire amount that was owed on my loan. I have done multiple transactions with them but the last two experiences with them have been horrible. I will not be coming back as a customer and I recommend you don't either!"
connie,"Got laid off from work, informed Cashnetusa and set up payment plan after I would be back at work. They took first payment when agreed but only a week later on the 6th took out another full payment instead of the 13th when I had agreed to the second payment of the plan. I called and the rep was unsympathetic just saying that was the regular payment from the plan I had initially agreed to. I informed him that by taking that money a week early, Cashnetusa may have prevented my ability to pay the loan back completely by taking all I had in my account for the next week. No sympathy and wasn’t willing to push the payment off for next week now. NEVER trust these people with your loan, go ANYWHERE else!!!"
Jeanne Besas,Fast and easy.  Thank you so much.
Stella McGee ,"Got a pre-approval offer, called and got approved for $1000 flex loan, signed contract, gave bank info, said would have the $500 that I was needing by 3/5/2020. Was checking on app and said I got denied after approval and sending copy of DL and Social, called customer service said sorry for confusion but it was denied and they have a signed contract from me and my account information. DO NOT FALL FOR THE OFFERS, I will have to contact a lawyer because I did sign a contract and have not received money from them and they have access to my banking, who’s to say they won’t try to collect payments"
louis,Legitimate lender. Calvin was helpful and very knowledgeable. Awesome service. Fast direct deposit. I would use their service again.W.S.
hortencia,Less than 24 hours ago I was Google searching this company and decided to go for it. I am blown away by how painless and seemless the application process was. I woke up with funds in my account that I needed to pay off some unexpected bills. Incredibly grateful. The app I downloaded to keep track of my balance due is so simplistic. Love it!!  I'll update as I continue this journey with CashNerUSA.
Colin Fay-Hagan,"A Great Quick Fix!  Had an extremely smoothand easy process, very proffesional, explained in a courteous and appropriate manner.  No hidden costs or quirky loop holes.  A great quick fix!"
bruce,Thank you the application was easy to fill out. I got a quick response and the money was in my account the next day.
Pela Showers,"The customer care representative was very informative n answered any questions I had, I'm glad cash net could help me in my financial situation. I would strongly recommend this company to others."
Chrishon Brown,Very smooth experience I will definitely tell any of my friends that need extra cash to use your services
Susan,Basically you will end up paying triple the amount you borrowed even if you pay on time.
RONDA,I paid my account off early and have been trying to reapply and keep getting denied. My credit score is up and all but I keep getting denied. I’m not sure why because the explanation they’re giving is not enough information. So why not ask for more information.
Debbie Ewell,They were great Nd answered all my questions
Darren,"Updated my review : gave it 2 more stars because I got a nice customer service rep to verify that whoever did my other application, did not enter my bank account info right and therefore she had to cancel , redo , and actually took the time to verify she had put the correct bank info before submitting application,and it got approved and I had funds next day. I give the nice customer service rep lady 5stars for going all out to verify info ,but 3 stars for the other lady entering info wrong (could’ve been prevented if she had repeated the bank info she put in system before submitting application .. not saying you have to be perfect butCome on )."
PAUL,"OK HERE WE GO AND WE'RE OFF AND FIRST OF ALL I HAVE LITERALLY BEEN TURNED DOWN WITH A FOR THE PAST 3 FULL YEARS OF TRYING AND CREDIT RANGING FROM 500 TO AN ALMOST 720 JUST TO KEEP HEARING THE SAME THING AND I DO PROMISE THAT THIS MAN WILL NEVER EVER APPLY AGAIN AND ITS SO SAD THAT A GOOD HARD WORKING MAN THESE DAYS CANT GET AHEAD DUE TO LOAN COMPANY'S LIKE ""CASH NET USA"" AND WITH THAT BEING SAID I WILL NOT REFER ANYONE AND IF YOUR LOOKING TO GET JUST A VERY AND I MEAN A VERY SMALL LOAN JUST TO HELP BUMP YOUR CREDIT AS I TRIED AND GOT TOTALLY TURNED DOWN FOR A SIMPLE $300 AND THATS IT BUT STAY AWAY FROM ""CASH NET USA"""
laurene murphy,Quick response and funding. No nonsense.Better terms than most as well. I’m a happy customer.
Paul,Definitely not very helpful or friendly if your credit score is low.....
Wesley,The application was easy. Customer service was excellent.
Martha  Velasquez,This is a scam company do not do business with them.
Tina,I love cashnetusa they are a wonderful loan company and when you need to talk with someone they are always there to answer your question
Johnson ,"Really bad experience for me, never again"
Elizabeth,"Thank you, the process was easy and took little time. Thanks for helping"
Roy Lesley,"Very impressed, money was there when they tell you it will be. Quick, easy and friendly. Thank you."
Syed,Good people and they really care about you.
Steven,"Very quick with processing requests and response, especially for Sunday request. Transaction was only 24 hours."
Deborah,"If i could give a negative 10 for as service, i would. The customer service from collections and account services is horrible. I tried to pay off my sister's balance with no such luck. I basically was given the run around and frustrated. I ask to speak to the manager and was told that the manager will call me back in the next 24 hours."
Tracy,Great service.  From start of application to money in my bank ... Completed in less than 4 hours.
Julia,"It's quick and easy for a reason. Stay away from the line of credit. 1500 dollars is made available, but the catch, which I feel isn't emphasized enough, is that it is at 30% ... a month. You pay back 500 in a monthly payment only to have about 90 go towards your actual principle. You'll end up paying 4k - 5k total in about 10 months, if you don't borrow against it again, for a 1500 dollar loan. The 300 payday loan is alright-ish, but stay away from the line of credit. I think they should show your monthly payments per month for the length of the loan before you approve of it. If you can pay it off quickly, like within a month or 2, it might not hit so hard."
Karen Alvarado,I didn't  get  any  runaround  it was  quick  and on point
Alyssa,I received my funds fast and free of hassle.
celerina,Cashnet was easy and followed through with the agreement I got my funds when they said!
Deneen,"I am very grateful for the approval of the loan I received, the loan comes at a very needed time in my life. I was very surprised when I received the approval since I have a low credit score.   Thank you very much."

Kiana Faulk,Always on time. 😊
James Nichols,Not sureHaven't finished
Christine,I would give negative stars if I could. My children and I are starving because they hit my bank account more than they were authorized to now my bank account is so far in the red and the fees just keep on because Cashnet wont admit when they've mad a mistake nor will they make it right. Service is horrible expect no help from them
Saima,Everything went good with recieving my loan & very informative on my pay schedule & the process for approval was done in a timely manner & I would most definitely return to CashNetUSA if I needed another loan. I would recommend this loan company to my fellow peers if they need a loan!! I was very pleased!
NKOSILATHI,"The process was short, sweet, and simple. The only downside IMO is I don't have an immediate breakdown of the payments due, but honestly it could gave been in the contract & I just missed it."
vernice coleman,Very easy to do appreciate your services. Thank you
Mary,I was surprised by how fast the loan amount gets approved.  It's a quick and easy process to receive the cash you need.

Rose Aragon,Very  pleased with the customer service and fast reply
"Kim-Sheridan,WY","I was really surprised at the ease of getting my credit line! So quick! I talked with a couple of customer service and they were great! Answered my questions and explained everything so I understood  the process!  Wonder what took me so long to decide to get the loan, which went away in my account the same day!"
TERR,it was super simple...just applied on-line. next day the funds were in my accounted.
Anonymous ,"it was great. everyone was great, the staff did a good job"
DjlJ,"Was in need of a short term loan avoid overdraft fees on my account and i came across CashNetUSA. I was skeptical at first but took a risk and choose to take out a loan. The process was easy & clear the money was sent the next business day and it really saved me a ton. They give it to you straight forward, the loan is for short term usage so don’t take out the loan if you can’t afford to pay it back it’s just that simple.Thank CashNetUSA!!!!"
Louuse,"Quick, easy, and professional"
JUDITH,I’ve been using  cashnetusa since 2005. Never ever had a problem . Many Banks turned me away however cashnetusa has always and I mean aways approved my loans. I keep up with my payments and never default . Customer Service is excellent. Just one little suggestion. Please offer promo codes every now and then for customer loyalty .
Patrick,"I have worked for a week with CashNetUSA loans and have yet to receive  anything but the runaround. My bank statement would not upload to their website, so I cut and pasted the important parts-to be rejected for about the 4th time. I screen shot the pages and sent that-rejected again-name not present. Really-get a website that allows easier applications. I am not a happy camper. All for a small loan of $650. The terms were good.  The interest was good.  The customer service people were polite and helpful. The end results  are not so wonderful. Maybe tomorrow will be a better day ."
Jennifer,just don’t get a loan with them even if you pay before your due date they will still take out your money from your bank account they made me over draft and they didn’t pay my overdraft fee just go with a Bank they will honor your payment not like cashnetusa so i payed my loan off in less the 2 months never again if i need a small loan i will look for a local bank
La,They were great.   Was easy to do.
Jerald,Thank you for approving my loan and helping me when no one else would. I will definitely be bringing my business to you again in the future. If I need another loan that is. Thanks!
Alberta,Excellent service.
Rosa Esqueda,Approved very quickly and funds received the next business day
Lisa F,It has been great so far. But I need to know how much my payment is and when its due?
Jacqueline,"Everything was handled professionally. Only problem I have, I still don’t know what my  monthly installment payment is. That would be very helpful to know before and after accepting the loan."

Mark,"Way too easy to use, honestly. But I am very thankful that I didn't have to take time off work to get the money I needed to get me through to next payday."
Brenda Grayson,"Terrible Company. You will get your money fast (at userous rates), they are efficient at that. But after that. . . I paid my loan off in a week 2/22/20 to be exact). Money came out of my account the next day (actually Monday 2/24) first thing in the morning. But it wont ""process"" until 2/26, or to be exact 2:00 p.m. CST on 2/26, which is 4:00 o'clock. So basically 2/27. The whole time it shows on my credit report. i did it as a short time to avoid that. I tried to get a hold of customer service. POINTLESS. I got a ""chat"" that took 30 minutes for them to tell me nothing. no offer to help or confirm they got it and clear it. Nope. Just wasted time. Go any where else."
Carmen,Very upset with cashnet ! Asked them to change a due date . Was told it was changed then they debuted my acct. after I told them I couldn’t pay it and they stole my BANKS money they still didn’t credit it back . After years of no problems with cashnet . I think I’m done . The interest is so high anyway . This company is crap

Michele,They did everything the flyer promised!  Application completed in about 10 mins. Same day approval . Approved for Same amount I was pre-approved for and money deposited within 2 days ( the next day)
ReadingEverything,They're Loan Sharks! They charge you an extreme amount of interest... So much so that you can't even touch the principal balance and you're just paying the interest! Please DO NOT USE CASHNET USA or you will regret it! Edited to say: Their reply is a joke! They aren't trying to help anyone! They are taking advantage of people! I've used other services that were far less costly. These people are the worst.
Victor,Fast decision and deposit of funds. Would recommend this company to other’s

Tyrisha,"Thanks yall were great, told others about you"
Ted,It was fast and didn't take no time at all. I'll definitely use you guys more.
nya,I got a loan for 750 and have paid back over 1500 and it still says I owe. No fees only missed one payment
Eugene,"This practice should be illegal! We borrowed $1500 for help with Christmas gifts and two months later, after paying back nearly $1800 (made extra payments) we still owe over $900. The convenience of the service they provide is needed by some; however, preying on less fortunate people to make 240-400% interest is just plain sinful. Leeches!"
customer,No loan no chance people lie just needed a lil help until I get paid or income tax comes in   soo disapointed  in y'all thanks gor nothing
Norma Lee,It was very convenient with the money going straight into  my checking account. The entire process went very smooth with no hassle.  I thank you for being  there in my time of need.

Customer,"***UPDATE OF MY UPDATE*** SEEMINGLY AFTER CASHNETUSA REREAD MY LATEST REVIEW, THEY'RE ISSUING A ""PENALTY"" FOR MY UPDATED REVIEW!!! I'M NOW ONLY ELIGIBLE FOR $100!!!! HAHAHA!!! WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITH $100!?! THAT'S WHAT I TIP THE GUY WHO DETAILS MY MERCEDES!!! KEEP READING!***UPDATED REVIEW*** This 1st paragraph is updated 8/5/2020, but continue to read, because chances are my first review will apply to you personally. I'm just updating, that I have sold one of my houses (I have 2 more) and in the middle of selling one of my small businesses (I have 1 more), and have made more money during this SCAMdemic than EVER before. If this BUSINESS sale goes thru, said and done, I would've made nearly or just over $600,000 this year, ALONE. That being said, I've paid down ALL of my debt, and I'm sitting at 14% total utilization with $26,000 total overall revolving credit. After waiting for nearly 2 MONTHS, my credit score, RIGHT NOW, IS 790, again with flawless payment history on EVERYTHING. I paid off over $17k in debt. My Fico is around 740. I'M STILL NOT QUALIFIED. Now, Obviously I DON'T NEED A LOAN, I JUST WANTED TO SEE IF THIS COMPANY STANDS BEHIND WHAT THEY CLAIM. AT THIS EXACT TIME, WITH MY CREDIT SCORES IN THE TOP 18% OF THE ENTIRE COUNTRY, I ONLY QUALIFY FOR $255 HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!! I wish a quarter star was an option!! Original review starts below so please read for the ones who don't have the credit that I have. Don't get dinged if you don't absolutely have to. Ok. I believe I've written a 5 star review before, because they've been such an outstanding lender over the past couple years, so let me explain why I am now giving therm just one star.First, I have a PERFECT credit history. Fico of about 660 or so.19 years of 100% on time payments. I carry about $10k in debt, but perfect, PERFECT on time payment history, and only 1 account in collections (the police department in So. Cal actually stole one of my show cars (swear on everything I know and love!!!!) and stuck me with an impound fee, and auctioned it off when they knew i was out of town for 5 weeks, TRUE STORY) and it will stay there until it falls off my credit report in 2 more years. Other than that, perfect.I have applied and successfully obtained 2 loans from cashnetusa. The first was for $2600. Got the loan in March of 2018. I MADE EVERY SINGLE PAYMENT ON TIME, AND HAD THE LOAN COMPLETELY PAID OFF BY THAT FOLLOWING JULY. Yes, within 4 months. Everything was hunky dory.Constantly bombarded by emails begging me to re-loan, because of attorney fees, I decided to reapply, and received ANOTHER $2600 loan last February of 2019, I believe. Again, I MADE EVERY SINGLE PAYMENT ON TIME, AND HAD THE LOAN COMPLETELY PAID OFF BY THAT FOLLOWING OCTOBER, as in 4 months ago (2019). NEVER LATE, NEVER MISSING A SINGLE PAYMENT. Again, I receive numerous daily emails asking me to re-loan, now for up to $3300 and special 'benefits'.Today, I open an email from Cashnetusa, and go to apply. I was told by ""upswing"", which is part of Cashnetusa, that I qualify for a 6% lower APR, and a ""delay-a-pay"" feature, because of my perfect track record. I logon, and to my surprise, I'm only qualified for $255. I navigate the website, log out, and log back in. Still, only $255. So I just called them and asked them what happened to my Upswing Loan amount of $3300. The lady sees my account history, and agrees with me and says ""That IS strange. I don't know. Let me put you on hold and ask my manager whats going on. You're not the first person to call about this issue."" SUPER nice lady BTW...so I agree. She comes back and says ""My manager said that its computer generated and you're only eligible for $255, but maybe in the future, you'll qualify for an Upswing loan."" I said ""What!?! YOU guys send me the emails and offers!!! So, you're telling me, you offer me 'benefits' and 'perks', that aren't eligible for the 'payday loan', and despite my perfect payment history with you guys, and everyone else in my financial web, you won't allow me to loan, or honor your email solicitations? I would think that you guys would WANT customers proven to repay their debts!!! WTH!!"" and all she can say is exactly what she had said a couple minutes prior. ""It's system generated and you'll just have to wait to see if you qualify and get invited again."" Well, how can I NOT!?!? Do you guys actually want people that have no intention of paying you back? How do you make money!?!So, what once was a prosperous, generous, and what I personally considered to be the BEST small amount lender just took a HUGE L. I will no way, ever, reapply to them after what they've just done to a LOYAL, PERFECT, 100% ON TIME PAYING AND PAYING OFF CUSTOMER, EVEN IF $3300 WILL BREAK ME. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED, AND THEY LOST A TRUE CUSTOMER OVER THIS BS."

Matthew,I would highly recommend Cash Net USA for any one either starting in the finance field or looking to move in the industry.
Jeanette,I've been using there services for over 10 years here and there. Most of the time when I was struggling out of highschool. now that im using them less because my finances are better. They no longer allow me to make payments on my loan because of the infrequency of using them. Although i've never missed a payment in that 10 years and my CS is 200pts higher than it was when i started using them. They've cut my available services. I will not be using them again. I would recommend people to avoid it if possible.
Norma Monter,I like cash USA bcause they r honest n respectful n I would recomend it to all my friends
MAY,Quick and easy. I’m very satisfied.
Sterlyn,Quick and easy application process and funding. Only thing I’d change is interest rate.

DARRYL,I had a great experience and I will recommend to others
Unknown,"Thank you, and Carla was most helpful in explaining details"
SHARON,"Since I can’t give ZERO stars , I reckon one will do. They are scammers. They do not have any interest in actually helping someone stuck in an financial bind instead they take ADVANTAGE of you. Those interest rates are absolutely ABSURD. You end of paying back 3 to 4 more than you actually borrowed . Luckily I have bad my debt to them but I definitely will NOT be doing business with them again . Highly NOT recommended!"
Lilly Ajuna,Very friendly to talk to and very helpful to thank you
Catrina,Very fast and easy.  Needed money fast for legal costs and had it the next day in my checking account.  The interest rate is through the roof but when you need cash fast for an emergency they are there for you.
DEBBIE,"Had a hard time with getting final step done & called customer service & she was very patient , friendly , and understanding. Definitely going to refer others."
Melanie Whitmore,The best they approve my loan in minutes
Michele,"Cash net usa has not done anything for me except collect my info and bank account. They sent me a pre-approval letter, I entered the info, and I was denyed. The whole thing seemed like a scam, and now I have to change all my info,bank account and ect. Terrible company, then once you complete a profile, you cant delete your account. Huge scam. Dont get drawn in like me. 299% apr,is not worth it."
Tomeka,"Fantastic, easiest loan app ever!"
DEVON,"It was really nice. The lady I spoke to on the phone was so very nice and helpful. And she was so very helpful. Thank you so very much. Sincerely, Amy Zacha."

Kcsmily,Approved but not approved. Y'all a joke.
Norma,"Crooks!I made an additional payment, but it was applied as a interest payment, and the interest payment was not taken from my account. Then interest was charged on top of the amount owed. BBB will be informed.Do not do business with this company.Too bad i cannot choose 0 stars."
DELMAS,"My mother in law passed away and I needed help. Thank God for CashnetUSA. We're able to go home and honor Mom, and celebrate her life. Thank you for being there when we needed you most."
Juan,"Fast approval. I did it on Saturday so the money wasn’t put in until Monday. So figure they don’t work weekends. A day after I received my money, I started getting messages that my loan was due soon. Knowing that my payday wasn’t until Friday, they had my loan due the day before my pay so I would have to pay late fee. Unless you are willing to wait a few days for your money and pay or back before your payday, DONT do business with them"
BRIAN,I was really in need. And needed money right away. And you all were right there. I really appreciate you guys. Thank you very much if it wasn't for you. I don't know what I would have done. Thanks again CashNet.
Wakonda,They were wonderful afrer all we went through they were very helpful they worked with me to get the promble fix and then we were on our way great joy ChasNet USA
gogreenmango go,I am very happy with my services from CasNetUSA. Thanks to them I was able to pay my bill and had a little left to take my children on an outting. Something I rarely get to do. Thanks a lot CashNetUSA.
THELMA,"It was good, got money on time which was indeed"
Minerva,Quick easy and great service.  Thank you Cash net
Marjon Anderholm,The individual I talked informed me of my options and advantages to the loan I was receiving.
KHADIJAH,Very fast and efficient. My only complaint is on the date it’s to be paid pack the money is always taken out of my account immediately.  So I don’t understand why my payment processes with this company for 5 days? It’s a automatic withdrawal so they immediately have the money.  I guess it doesn’t make sense to me.
JJ,"Jeffrey Morgan (Loan Advisor) kept saying that due to some debt, they needed money sent to this company in order for me to be approved with a loan. DON’T EVER BORROW FROM THESE PEOPLE!!! They legit made me spend about $2-$3k within 3-4 months just because of some other random  debt that shouldn’t have concerned them. Jeffrey would ask to put money into a Walmart card and then give him the info to receive the money. In return, you’d expect to receive the loan you applied for but it’s all a big SCAM!"
Chi-Lin Glasco,Fast and efficient. Thank you .
BARBARA,The are  helpgul too you
Delores,The women who handled my call was efficient and professional.
Richard,"I was directed here and since my husband passed I have tried to get help ,with no luckand all my friends have said ,Anna try usaloans, I gave up trying and had nothing but good things to say about them .  Thanks so much to those that sent me here and to you all at usa"
AMBER,Liars. They assure you your approved then turn around and deny you. They lie and say they don’t do a credit pull when they do.
Michael,Very quick and easy application process. I was approved in minutes and had money in my bank account the next day.
Inez,I saw the ad on tv and was skeptical but went online and the process was so easy and quick. I am very satisfied.

Terri Phillips,Love how simple and easy the process was to get a loan from them.  There were no complications everything was smooth really good process like their system.  My only complain is they should let me more money as I have already borrow from them a couple of times and they only let me the same amount.  They should look at my history and increase my lend amount.

Angelo,"I'm a senior of 71. I get $800 a month to live on SSI and SSA. I could never survive without Cashnet Payday Advances. I'm never ahead but I'm never behind with CashNet. Everything is so easy online, it's like online shopping sites, order it, get it, and never have to wait in line to leave. In this world instant gratification is hard to find anywhere."
TYLER,The service was just as advertised on tv. Thank you.
Angela,"This is the worst loan company out there. There interest rates are crazy high....they charge you a daily interest charge..and if you need an extension, they will give you an extension but they charged me 63.44$ to get a 10 day extension and then charged me another 63.44 interest on top of the original loan which was only 250$...In the end I will have paid Cash Net USA 126.88$ to loan me 250$...which is almost like loan shark fees...it is completely ridiculous..Lend Up is a much better payday loan company. I got the money fast but it was not at all worth it.  Do not borrow from Cash Net USA unless you like giving away your hard earned money. I will pay them off but I will neverrrrrrrrr everrrrrrrr get another loan thru them. If you cannot pay your loan back immediately it just is not worth borrowing from this company."
ROBERT,hklfjkjc nknj.
Ina Burkhalter,"No help at all! Didn't take long to turn me down! Plus, gotta wait 30 days for a letter in the mail to explain why?"
Judy Bogan Gonzalez,Experience was quick and easy. friendly stafaf.
Sharron,The process was really easy and fast. I didn’t get the exact amount I need but their offer was so close to what I needed with no hassle it was a great relief for me.
Albert Richard,"I'm reluctant to even give them one star. This coming from someone who has gotten loans from numerous reputable companies, in dire times, and paid them all back with no outstanding balance. These people are vultures, in the worst way. We all need a little immediate help from time to time, that's the result of the economy we live in. Though I'm very serious when I say, I'd have to be literally starving with no other option, than to take another loan through this company. There's plenty of loan companies out there with a compassionate, helpful, competent staff available to you. Seek them out and pass this up. It's some of the best advice on this matter I could give anyone."
Peter,"They did exactly what they said that they would do. They came through for me, and I really needed it"

DALE,I love this company cash net USA the near every time I need help they have been great and the couple times I had problems paying it back they worked with me for someone who is disabled and is on SSI They have given me the kits when they didn't have to from the beginning I told my friends and family about them and how great they are I would refer people to cash net USA would no problem and I am a very very picky person  And I don't recommend places very easily so when I do my friends and family know that it must be an excellent company thank you cash let us say for all your help and support over the last couple years
Maria,"I received a loan and decided I did not need it anymore and they reversed my loan on the same day.  They told me no interest would be due and everything was all good.  However, they took out the interest anyways when the original loan came due!!!  It has been over a month and I still have not received it back!!!  OVER A MONTH to correct something simple.  Disgraceful!!  Bad customer service on their part!!"
Sheila Lohman,Everytime i apply they deny me so if your credit score os not a 600 or above then most likely you will not get approve

Staci Schultz,Been a long time customer until today. I followed instructions per 2 representatives but they missed/forgot to communicate 1 very important step. My application was withdrawn without my knowledge and No one was willing to correct their error. I will not return nor refer anyone.

lila jackson,"Not clear about billing details up front and once you actually get your money they bill you bi-weekly at a high payment rate. They also charge interest on almost daily basis. I paid what was showing as my account balance and once I returned to home screen, they had added another $12 to my balance which I had to pay in order to pay them off."
EARLENE,Great and fast
Lara,"I think their customer service is one of the best, I had a very good experience. I don't know if I've been approved yet. But even if I was not approved I think they're still a very good business!!!"

Jason ,If I could it would be no star. This company is horrible. Took $300 title loan out for Christmas 5 yrs ago on my mustang so I could give my kids a good Christmas and now after I ended up in a bad situation and couldn’t make the payments that year they took my car and sold it at that point I figured it was over and done with. I got a call this week saying my income was going to be garnished called to find out why only to hear it was this company saying I stole from them and now I have to pay them $1000 or my wages get garnished. Now last I checked my mustang was worth way more then what the loan was for and on top of that the lady was completely rude and didn’t want to set up a payment arrangement so I could get this over and done with. Stay away from this company!!! I can not say this enough!!!! A 300% interest rate is ridiculous! They will not work with u at all they just want your money!!!!
RENEE,"So far as getting the funds has been great, got them in less then 24hrs.Now let's see how it goes come payment time. Lol"

Cecily,Great work cashnet you guys came through when I needed you an I appreciate that..💯
Debra,"You hear a lot of bad things about payday loan companies but CashNet is pretty legit.  I get the small loans, up to $255, I don't go overboard with taking too much.  But their installment loans have ridiculous fees; you're basically paying a fee to them equal to the loan amount, which i think the installment loans start at like $1,000.  It's highway robbery.  I did the installment loan once and it was very hard to pay off.  I do not recommend the installment loans but I do recommend the small loans.  I also have to mention their stellar customer service, you wouldn't expect it from a payday loan company but every time I talk to a customer service representative, they are always kind and professional.  CashNet will always have my business!"
Tracey Knight,"I was at the point when I realized I needed money just for fuel and food to last 7days till my first paycheck from my new job arrived that following week.  CashNetUSA has the availability to allow you to make a selection of varies amount to help you out, I was approved within 10min and the money was in my account the next morning...like 5am.I was so relieved and thankful. With a new job, no one to help me out, on my own! I really am thankful for CashNetUSA to give me a sense of relief and content. 😁 Thank YOU CasnNetUSA."
Wallace Fox,I called the toll free number and got excellent service! I was walked through the whole process by a very nice lady (I'm so sorry i don't remember her name because she really was very helpful and patient). I have already recommended your site to two of my friends who are also looking for loans. Thank you so much for the great service.

Elena,"I have used CashNetUSA on and off for a couple of years now and have always had a great experience. Transactions smooth and always paid back on time. However this most recent time the loan was repaid as usual through my bank on autopay on time and Cashnet's website shows it was paid on time on 1/17/20, however 6 days later Veritec is still showing the loan outstanding. A call to Cashnet referred me to Veritec. A call to Veritec referred me back to Cashnet. Another call to Cashnet and I was told there was nothing that could be done. Needless to say I'm a little disappointed and still unsure of what to do.Response to reply from CashNet -7:00pm ETI did call and was told that they cannot view why Veritec denied it. I explained that I understood that and that was why I was told to call Veritec and Veritec said they can’t view CashNet only that my account was still being reported open. When I asked CasNet what else I could do they told me to call Veritec. I’m just being bounced back and forth with both sides saying they can’t do anything.Second reply. -  9:30pm ET After much frustration CashNet finally got things straightened out. Whether computer glitch or human error thank you so much for getting this fixed. You’ll always be my go to in an emergency!"
DE,Ez application process. Very helpful call center staff.
Randy Hyde,no one can explain how to fix the account information
William Valin,"Fast, easy, not complicated. They don’t make a decision by your credit history like some places do! I’m sure I’ll use them again!jeff g."
Charlotte Morgan,"I have been using Cashnetusa for years and years. I asked them to pay my loan in full on 12-31-19. They first used a card that my bank said was violated by fraud. It did not work. The default payment should have been to my checking acct which they did not do. On the 3rd of January, Cashnetusa charged my checking acct the dollar amount for the monthly fee, incurring more interest. Something is wrong here."
James D,"Fast , prequal was easy . Helped tremendously. 350 only cost $48 which is cheaper than most."
Roseann Light,They lie don't recommend them at all they are scammers if they text me one more time I will use them

Gwen,"I applied for a loan and was approved for $1450.  I selected that I only wanted to borrow $500.  When I went through the process I was approved.  Wanting to know what my payments would be, I contacted customer service.  They said it would be $148 every two weeks!  When I asked how this could be for a $500 loan request I was told they base their payments on the amount of credit youre approved for, not what you actually borrow!  What a misleading and dishonest practice.  How can you set payments based upon an approval amount and not what was actually borrowed???  Needless to say I cancelled before the money was put in my account.  Do not use them!  They are scammers!"
Barbara,I needed a little bit of cash and applied on cashnetusa online.  I did not think they would approve me!  The process was easy!  Thank you CashNetUSA!!

I have bern paying every 2 weeks since September and i am still only $300 less than what i borrowed. The customer service rep was very dry and unfriendly when i called with questions. No one can seem to tell me what my total pay back will be nor how much longer i will be paying. I will not be recommending this company. I was also told that they only report to the Credit Bureau if i stop paying. So all of my on time payments are not even helpful."

Kawika,"I would send them a paper and they would ask for something else and we would have to reapply for the loan again and it was the same thing over and over for over a week and a half.  Don't waste your time.  They would call you several times a day and request something else.  Our bank said they would loan us the money we needed and to not trust payday loan companies, especially when they want your login and password for your bank account."

leevelle ben,"I had used this company without any problems for nearly a year. Consistently paid off every loan on time. The last time I applied, I was denied without reason and the customer service was of little help, telling me to only reapply after 30 days. I was not in the waiting period that some states required and had paid off the previous loan on time. Having been a long time customer, I believe I should have been given a reason in case there was an issue I was unaware of and needed to resolve. I would not recommend using this company."

Antoinette,"I have taken out several loans with my payday being Thursday and the payment date being the next day on Friday.Now all of a sudden they need to take the money out on Thursday the actual payday. The problem is that CashNetUSA takes the money out at 12:01am sharp which would cause my account to run negative & initiate a fee of 34.00 for NSF.....then my check would come in around 3am and be short due to the fees. Now they claim thats been a policy since the beginning....Sure. Then how is this the only time I have been blocked. This is not my first loan.....so the policy aint reach my account til 2020. Cause for the past decade every loan was approved, funded & paid back on full. NOW JAN 3RD 2020.......ITS A PROBLEM. You guys lost, Lost a great customer due to a stupid policy.....yet I bet its people dont even pay yall back.....dumb...just dumb."

Leslie ,Customer Service was very helpful. Thanks
Alex,"I thought t was going to have a great experience but I was wrong.  They actually made my situation worse because they at first approved my loan for a $300.  I signed the documents.  They told me to stop looking, so I did.  Next thing you know, about 5 hours before I was supposed to get the cash.  They denied my loan that they already approved blaming my credit score and factors that is obvious when you look up my history with my social.  Now I feel that it's a scam.  Fraudulent.  I will find out.  Beware of this lender"
Marilyn  Maracle,"The loans are designed with the very specific purpose of keeping poor people in debt indefinitely. Myself, I've paid over $500 into a $600 loan, all on time, and I currently owe MORE than what I borrowed. Since the amount of payment goes down, the outstanding balance never does. If I had not been on the verge of losing my job and becoming homeless, I wouldn't have even thought about it. Point is that if you are poor like me, avoid this place like the plague. Knowing how I worded this, I expect it to be buried."
Chris Sisam,Needed some extra $ and  in a few mins was approved thank you
Michelle Lewis-Peppers,I was in a bind financially and they helped me when no one else would

Mr. Sims,"Wasn’t going to give not one star, bunch of liars. This is about 2/3rd time I’ve applied and each time same response, we can’t help you. Can’t even give me reason. Have bank account, had same job almost 4 years, residence just as long so what’s the problem? Any ways cash net USA sucks and use a lot of false advertisement. Only have one star or else I wouldn’t have been able write this comment. Thanks for nothing../"
Christine Webb,"As a new customer, I was very skeptical about trusting CASHNET.  I see the commercial often with the man that has the cape, it's a funny skit. Trying to rebuild my credit, and I was accepted by CASHNET.  They took a chance with me, so I'm taking a chance with them. It seems like a reliable company, and I have not read any derogatory reviews."

Cameron James,"I used my iPhone to set up my CashNetUSA.com account. Once that was a completed, I was evaluated and approved in less than 10 minutes. I downloaded the companion app, and it makes it very easy to monitor my flex-loan account, and request draws. I can highly recommend using CashNetUSA. Even the representative that followed up with us was courteous, helpful, and contacted us before the close of business that day."
Maga,"Log in never works but they won't fix it on their end you will need to recreate your password repeatedly. Called and asked for a higher amount to be paid, but I received two emails stating the incorrect amount was paid 4 days after the payment was supposed to post. Really not trustworthy."

Cashnet USA came through for me when I was at a lost for a miricle. I really don't know what I would have done if they cashnet hadn't help.

Priscilla Buskirk,"If I could give them 0 stars I would. Took out a loan and asked for a new repayment date. They agreed. I did this within the time from allotted for a date change. To my dismay, they still debited the money from my account on the original pay back day causing my bank account to not only be negative but ensue fees. When I contacted customer service they were completely rude and took no responsibility. Do not deal with this company. They are completely FRAUDULENT along with their exorbitant interest fees. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE. PREDATORY! They’ll likely respond with some lame automated customer service response saying they’re sorry and want to help with a customer service number that no one can ever get through. Don’t waste your time. They also continuously debit from your account and steal money. STAY FAR AWAY!"

You know how you hate to talk to the people go dig for information or show proof nope not them.. they tell how much you can get and it's up to you if u want to see how much you take they give u nice amount depending on u.. but I only needed half but it turn out couple day later I did guess what they gave me the whole thing .. what other loan company does that.. other loan company give you the amount and once you sign that's it this .. example they say you can get 1200.00 but you only want 600 .. ok turn out I need more guess what u got the 1200.00 it on u what you use up and pay back.. it just sitting their in account just hit the button  u need 600 more and it will tell you when it be in your bank account.. I freaking love this loan company.. and no their no string attack and paying it back is biweekly or how every u wanted is not high like some other company it .. my payments are below 100 every company I been to always 100-200 biweekly...

Oscar,"Do not deal with this company.  We missed a payment, made payment arrangements to make up that payment over 3 months and then they told us that we had to also pay the original payment which is quite high at the same time, resulting in a double payment.  Naturally the loan amounts keeps accruing daily interest and keeps going up and up.  And if you can't pay the now double payment, it only gets worse. If you try and make payment arrangements to pay them back, they absolutely do not want to work with you.    So run as far and as fast as you can.  We should have."

Tiffany,"They lie and deny. They tell you one thing, but that thing turns out to be false. Then they do absolutely nothing to correct their mistake. They told me to do one thing in order to get approved, and that one thing ended up getting me denied. And even though I was told to do it by the them, they won’t correct it. I will NEVER do business with them again. They mislead you, lie to you, and then deny you. Then they blame me and treat me like crap. NEVER AGAIN!________________________________________In response to the reply by CashNetUSA, if you were really concerned enough to do an “investigation,” you would simply research my account and you would see the whole drawn out saga notated in my account. Multiple times, and multiple days. However, as I originally stated, you lie. You did not, nor do you want to, investigate. Therefore you have real concern to rectify the situation. Or you did investigate and flat out don’t care. In either event, you are still lying, and now are denying that your lying. I stand by my review 100%. NEVER AGAIN!"
Thomas,Don’t know to much about these new phones but the people who helped me were very caring and helped me get everything I needed done. Very professional. Will definitely use them again if I need to. Thank you all so very much

Eric Bell,I am very grateful for you guys helping someone with credit like mine out. It was a blessing. The only bad thng for me is when I did my loan it wouldn't tell me my payment and how many payments. I hope there is a way that this can be fixed. When ibhit the button apply for the loan I assumed it would show me how much my payments would be and how many payments if you were only doing the minimum payment but all I did was put in the dollar amount and hit apply and that was it  again I messed my credit up along time ago and it's so hard to borrow money so again I'm very grateful for the help. I just don't want to get something I couldn't afford and it be like everything else. But from the emails to chat everything I did was top notch and done in a rapid way so again thank you.

Derek,"very good. however, I did get a text message from another cash pay service the next day saying I needed to verify with them that in order to complete my order I would have to fill out information through text, my banking info to have them deposit the $2600 into my account. I didn't, I ended the text by typing in STOP. But I thought it was weird they had all my information that I had shared with the transaction with you."
TRACY,Got it on time and very please with the services that was provided.
Shelly,This is total garbage. You pay 15% fee instantly on top of the insanely high interest you incur 299% APR!!!. For the love of god do not accept these loans unless you have an absolute emergency. These loans can and do ruin lives.

Antonio,Was simple and easy the only thing i dont like is they dont tell u what your payments are going to be.
Monty,"I deposited 80.00 into my checking account on November 29th towards payment for Cashnet USA. Thinking I would be able to borrow more money. Now that doesnt even show up as ""paid"". So I have to stiil pay a minimum of 40.00. What happened to that 80.00?"
Kimberly,It was easy and fast . I will tell family  and friends.  When they need some cash.
KEIRL,This money really came in hand. Thank you all for your services.
Ernie Gobbi,"I have been bombarded lately with loan offers from companies I have never heard of. I wanted to get a small loan to help me bridge my finances, upcoming bills as well as Christmas.  I just found a great new job but I haven't been there long enough to get caught up on my money situation. I saw a familiar commercial for CashNet USA as I was getting ready for work, went online and filled out my application (very fast-very easy) and received an approval within 30 minutes and had the funds in my account by mid-afternoon. Not only was I totally impressed with their simple and easy process but by having the funds deposited the same day, well it just took the weight of my financial burden off my shoulders and the stress out of my gut.  You can't go wrong by giving them a few minutes of your time by filing out their forms online. I bet that you will have your financial hiccups sorted out as quickly as I did!!!!!"
DONALD KNOWLTON,The experience was a blessing. I thank God for people like you. To make this Christmas so very special for me to be able to enjoy. God Bless you.
Michael Crow,Great service immediate funding in less than 24 hours. Will definitely do business with them again if needed.

Chris Howard,Really easy to get a loan online.   Had the money in the bank about three hours after i was approved.  Great experience!
Stanley Travis,"The payday loans are “ you see what you get”. Just like most payday loans!  But I am warning you DONOT TRY THEIR INSTALLMENT LOANS ITS A COMPLETE RIP OFF!!! Example if u get paid every two weeks they will be taking it out every two weeks and a 200.00 payment on a 1200 loan just goes to interest and you are not paying anything on the loan.  If you get in a bind like your hours are cut, they will not offer you any options that are helpful only another payment divided up so no you have two loan payments out there! Every two weeks coming out your checks so it’s not helping you financially ,   Their are other loans out there way better than this!!  Try them instead.  Lend up is way better than this company.  These people are insensitive vultures!!! Run!!! Don’t use them!!!"
Darryl Wiseman,They are very fast and trusted. I will recommend them to any friend of mine who needs help.

Anonymous ,I called cashnet USA about twenty seven days ago asked for 500 dollars some guy from there called me rite after I applied and told me that it wasnt approved. So then he said would u like me to try for a lesser amount 300 dollars he said it would be broke into two payments one this monthfor 175 dollars and one next month for 175 dollars all togather I would pay back 352 dollars I said okay hung the phone up then fifteen minutes later got a message saying i wasnt approved  said okay the heck with it gave up on it then three days ago I get a email saying I had a payment due on the 27 of this month I never signed anything or went over the loan agreements with anyone so now I'm supposed to have all 352 dollars  tomorow

Ive called them and they said they are processing my application. They have been processing it for 6 days still havent heard from no one. and everytime i call they say the same thing. I am very disappointed."
Angela,Thanks for the help but never again..Its ridiculous how much they take out your check twice a month..Than on top of that they taking what they want each time..no set price monthly..my 1st an last time..Don't do it guys unless you have money to give away..

barbara bracha,I'm not sure what everyone's raving about they sure didn't help me at all and I really needed it for me and my child we ever get through these holidays and not have shut off notices every other day so yeah they didn't do anything for me... Because of my credit score they refused to loan me anything so there is no reason for me to contact customer care.
Debra,Easy to apply and fast response I will use again
Angela,Very simple very easy got the money in less than 24 hours person on the telephone very concise and easy to understand very professional thank you very much
Penny Mathis,Very discriminative against credit history when they said that they accept good bad or no credit at all they can help they help me and no way possible without no reason and said that the send me an email in 30 days what the hell I wouldn't recommend CashNet to anyone those who say they're good and helpful well those are European but my opinion is don't waste your time
Charmaine Davis,Great. Really helped me out.
customer,Terrible! Dont bother with it!!!
Linda Felder,Stupid can’t apply for a loan to help with Christmas stuff

Linda,Much better than I expected it would be.  Thank you
Jo Putman,The representative was very efficient and everything went smoothly!
Eric Brown,gave information well answers professional
Cynthia Miller,"I used to enjoy using their payday loan services and have used them eighteen times this year. However, my recent loan that was supposed to be funded the same day was placed on hold without anyone reaching out to me. Now almost three days later I called them to ask why they have placed my funds on hold and their response is that I need to verify my address and they supposedly sent an email that I never received regarding this. The only email I received was stating that my application was processing and the funding date was the same day and I would be contacted if any additional information was needed.  All I can say is do not depend on them if you have an immediate need as they will leave you hanging and their customer service representatives will be indifferent towards you."
Leandro,I thanks your staff is nice and pilote and the service is great and I wish you all to have a happy and safe holiday through out the year and a happy new year  with blessings thanks slot darryl
Dubar,I had a really great experience dealing with you guys. The lady i spoke with was a big help. And very patient with me. I will be dealing with this company from now on.

Roger McCarty,"EXCELLENT support, fast, friendly service!!"
Anthony,Easy to work with and fast!
Nicole,Good experience
ARMANDO,Thank you so much. Very easy to apply.
Francisco,"At first, the payday loans were good for getting me out of a bind or keeping the electricity on, however beware of the line of credits. My state finally qualified and the interest rate is totally ridiculous. You end up owing over twice as much as you borrowed. For example: $600 becomes a little over $1400 with fees and interest. This will hurt you more than help you in the long run. I am disgusted at myself for being gullible in a time of need and not fully reading the terms and conditions to see how unwise this loan would be. That money (over $500 fees and interest in three months) could have helped my family in so many other ways."
Dana,Received money in a timely manner. Great people to borrow from.
TAREE,Well I didn’t expect to get a loan  and so quickly That was great  thanks)’

Terry,Quick and easy! Definitely helped me at a hard time.
Greta Lowery,It was easy and fast like said. Answered all the questions but  but one I was giving a answer to look forward to the the the answer later. Like how much at a time I would pay back. And was told I know in two weeks. But other than that it was great
Elton Hopkins,"Really great, got approved had a mistake on my part but was taking care of quickly. I would recommend them for sure!"
THOMASENA,Pretty quick when I needed it the most. Only thing is that they will charge the money on one time payment I'd like it if they could give you payment options.
Chris Green,Great service will definitely deal with you guys again
DRM,Very convenient very fast no hassles nothing they were on time they were very good I really appreciate it thank you CashNetUSA but loyal customer thank you
Randall Stover,"It’s a crime how much interest they charge! Predatory lender!!! They won’t even let you pay of the loan in a day, it takes two days to process a loan payment in which time they charge you interest, so you can never pay it off. Criminals, do not borrow from them!!!"
DONNA,Very good experience. They helped me right when I needed it. No hassles at all. I would recommend everyone to see you!

Loretta Wood,"Very pleased, thank you so much 🤗🤗🤗🤗🙂🙂🙂"

I have never experienced any lenders do such a mervelous thing, rushing to your aid in a lightning speed to help someone in a dial need of Cash to solve your pressing situations I personally asking everyone one out there to try cashNetUSA to rescue you from drowning in a difficult situations."
Andrea Weiler,"Overall, an easy process."
Kelly Roache,"I was hesitant at first, but so glad I tried them out. It was very fast and in my account the next day. I will definitely use this service again..Thank you Cashnet!"
Brittany,Horrible service you get charged everyday for the amount you've taken out and they raise you minimum without notice on top of the 299% interest they give you worst choice I've ever made is coming to these loan sharks the way they are setup is too keep you in their debt. i can wait to pay this loan off and be done with these thieves they aren't here to help anyone just screw you over.
Sandy,Really helped me out of a tight spot and fast. Thank You
Suzanne Vasquez,This company put yoy through to many changes
William and Aprell Barker,great service. Just doesn't let you know payments or due date.
Patricia Mccoy,I got a fast reply and my funds were made available for use the next day
katherine,The process was easy but it's taking a long time for the money to show up in my account. My credit union professes everything immediately so not sure of the issue!
CALEB,It was a simple experience they help you very fast
I tried VC,"Run, run the other way as fast as you can. Never ever will I use this crooked place. Read the terms and said you could pay a minimum payment over a period of time or pay your full balance. MISLEADING, I withdrew $100 from my $1,500 line of credit. When I looked at my statement it showed the minimum payment $103.56? How is that a minimum payment, that is my full balance! Contacted them and was told that was my minimum payment, that there was no option for a minimum payment! What BS, MISLEADING, LYING terms in their contract. I maynot be the brightest bulb in the pack, but I do know the difference between a MINIMUM payment and a FULL BALANCE payment. Better off to go to a loan shark on the corner, NEVER NEVER EVER again!!!!"
Lafayette,The process was quick and painless! I would recommend CashNet USA to anyone needing help in a quick way!
C. Coles,Took a little longer than expected for approval. Otherwise good to get cash fast.
Christopher re,Everythings excellent except for the wait time of the funds almost 2 days
Amy ,No helpp no help 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Rodney Ellis,"I never received clear information about my request, however, I did receive the loan and I am grateful for that."
RW,Waaaooo so fast. Thanks a lot
Yalunda,"CashNetUSA was fast, easy, and simple! I can’t believe how easy it was!"
Brishay Clark,Got my money the next day !
Kyle Owen,"I had loans with these people and payed them all off on time never late and now can't get a loan and denied because their letter says they can't verify who I am, or lack of credit. REALLY? Had two other loans and now you can't tell who I am. Not a great way to run a company. Poor customer service and just not a way to keep people happy. Oh well. Will have to find someone else. I had a ""manager"" just call me after posting this review and after verifying everything including the last four of my SSN and it showed I had an account he said they had no control over their computer system and could not even manually enter anything into it to say I was a real person. REALLY? So now I'm going to freeze my credit and all because if you have NO control over what YOUR computers do, then who the hell know who has our information. I would add you probably don't want your ""managers"" calling people and telling them this, cause now going to have to wonder how many people were charged wrong, your computers screwed up paydays, or whatever, and customers were the ones holding the bag, when really it was your computers doing it cause you have no control over them, your employees words not mine. Like I said, had two loans no problems or issues until their computer could not verify me, or cause I had lack of credit. You called and talked to me, yet you could not verify who I am....LOL!! You have been warned people. Makes you wonder how many of these GOOD reviews are even real ones or just their computers generating them?!?!?! Now EVEN more scared since I did not apply again yesterday for a new loan or repeat loan and got this in my email this morning....November 19, 2019Dear kevin hays,Thank you for your recent application for a loan. Your request was carefully considered, and we regret that we are unable to approve your request.Reasons for Denial of CreditYour application was processed by a proprietary scoring system that assigns a numerical value to the various items of information we consider in evaluating an application. These numerical values are based upon the results of analyses of repayment histories of large numbers of customers.The reason(s) you did not score well compared with other applicants were:Unable to verify personal information or identity. Limited credit experience. Insufficient number of credit references. If you have any questions regarding this letter, you should contact us at:CashNetUSA Customer Support175 W. Jackson Blvd. Suite 1000Chicago, IL 60604Phone: (888) 801-9075Fax: (866) 413-3888And remember this is after having TWO loans with them back to back just recently all paid on time, yet they cant figure out who I am, and/or lack of credit.....Horrible.So now they called again and said I was lying about having loans with them, so here is the proof from THEIR OWN WEBSITE. Loan ID: 4725682711/6/2019 Manual Payment ACH$281.59 Paid10/7/2019 Loan Principal ACH$250.00 FundedLoan ID: 470795599/30/2019 Automatic Payment ACH$283.13 Paid8/28/2019 Loan Principal ACH$250.00 FundedI encourage you all to ask your employer for a draw or find other companies than this one as clearly they have zero ethics or customers service skills."
Donald Review,I absolutely do not like this company I've been with them for almost over two years they're interest is way too high They do not care if it's the last $100 in your account they're going to take it from you They will not go and push it back to a weekly basis they're just going to try and rape you basically I swear whenever I get this paid off I will never be back to these people
Jamie ,I'm very impressed with the site. They made my situation very clear.  Relieve my stress.  Thank you for giving me a chance
Jeanine Schollmeyer,"Service is decent from reps (it depends on the luck of the draw), however, this company CANNOT give you a payoff schedule or balance (which means they want you to stay stuck in their loop of paying them forever).  If you need cash quickly due to an unexpected emergency cost, then Cashnet USA should be a ""last resort"" resource.  Just know I have borrowed about $2500.00 from them in the last two years and I have no idea how long it will take to pay them off or how much money it will cost me.  This is scary because they set-up automatic payments every pay period for the MINIMUM balance.  Now if you only pay the minimum balance, there is a daily accrual rate (of an extremely miscellaneous set of numbers, etc 0.81917808 or whatever it is).  This means that if you do not pay MORE than your minimums, the daily accrual balance will continue to accumulate each day that your loan isn't paid off.  With any other loan (student, car, bank, etc, it tells you your principal amount every billing cycle, as well as the interest, so you know at any and all times  what is required to pay to payoff the loan).  With CashNet, there is absolutely NO WAY to tell if you are getting ripped off or not.  The customer service representatives cannot even calculate this for you.  It is very possible CashNet is stealing from their customers.  If you like not knowing exactly where all of your money is going, use Cashnet USA.  Otherwise, if you want to take out a reasonable loan to assist you during hard times, that you can pay off within the year, choose something else.  This company exploits those who aren't knowledgeable about budgeting, credit, or loans.  When I started working with them, I didn't know a thing about how to manage my money so it all sounded good and fine.  But now that I have done research and made plenty of money mistakes I wish that I never worked with them.  USE ONE MAIN FINANCIAL!  They will give you a payoff estimate and will allow you to borrow more money if needed in the event you pay off the original loan."
Takis Garner,So far everything is going well. Thank you
Mrs.Lewis,It was quick and very good service. Very friendly
Tracie Dockery,Cashnet really came through for me!! Just in time for the holidays. Easy process. I’m very pleased and would recommend to anyone!
Josh ,Signing up was easy have not used it withdrawing money yet to fix the car but planning on it within the next two weeks
Kim Yanczura-Byers,You people ROCK! Thank you so much!
Thomas Wheeler,I will let everybody know about your loans. Keep up the work
Debra,Awesome service so far! Thank you cashnetusa! You rock!
Gustavo Guerrero,Each but to much like a credit card. Still this will help
Mark Jost,The lady was very helpful in all our questions. Walked me thru the process to change the banking info.
Patricia,"The reps don't help with anything. They don't care and do nothing to help with issues such as changing the bank account number I gave because it's the wrong one. Reading the reviews it seems they have a copy and paste system for responding so they are clearly one lazy company. They will not put you on the line with a manager and will not change my bank account information all the while still upping my outstanding balance every day. The actual company is as bad as a scam company. I went through them on a referral to boost my credit and am getting charged for a $1,000 loan that I never received. They're doing Literally nothing about it. I would much rather date them as nothing as they have done nothing to show they care for their client. This is the worst business experience I've ever had in my life. How do you people get by like this? Well I guess the answers the fact that they're basically scammers themselves. I'm taking legal action. This is preposterous."
Rema,This was fast and easy.  But still font know how much my first payment is
Mary Johnson,"My aunt was referred to this company by a friend, we thought we'd give them a try. First of all the application was fairly easy, but the level of unprofessionalism was off the charts unacceptable. She got approved for one amount, they then started requesting documents and she sent everything they asked for right away, even while at the bank. They lowered her approval amount which was ok but then started saying they needed more documents which were the same as the first documents they requested. I guess they thought something was gonna change or not add up. They telling her that the member number at her credit union is not the account number. Even after the bank provided a letter of verification stating that her member number is the account number. 9 different representatives were emailing her and that is unprofessional. Then I call in for my aunt and request a supervisor and I got hung up on.... On top of all that my aunt got an email saying that her documents had been received, reviewed, and verified and she would get the money by Monday. Then she got Another email saying her request was cancelled until they get a voided check! I wanted to call and curse them out sooooooo bad but I'll just move on... They are plenty loan companies out there with better interest rates than 325%. Cashnet usa can go to hell! 😊"
Sue,Very happy with how easy my experience was
Jada Caillier,"I made the mistake of filling out all the stuff on their website to get a 300$ loan. I got to the step JUST before finalization when I saw that they charge everyone a 50$ fee to deposit the funds they loan out. This is nothing but ridiculous, brazen greed. I hope the owners of this business can take all their precious THINGS to hell with them to keep em entertained for eternity. Now the company has my info and I constantly get mailers and calls from predatory loan businesses daily; even though I didn't go through with the loan since I'm not stupid or unfathomably desperate (which are the exact people these businesses have been setup to TAKE ADVANTAGE OF). ROT CASHNETUSA, you are one of the sleaziest among a sea of sleazy predatory lending businesses who prey on the least fortunate people in society."
Elizabeth ,Got what I needed and Nichole was great chat help.
Lynell,"I really liked how fast it was done and I am happy with the results,thank you."
Tyris,"Quick application, and approval,thank you"
Darryl,"Horrible Company, one second it approves you but if you change your mind about the amount you want to borrow they will deny you. The rep I just spoke to states that if you login you will have to accept the offer they give you with the amount they give you and you can not log out and think about it because once you log out and log back in they will run your credit AGAIN and possibly give your a higher loan amount and might/might not get approved and if not approved you will need to reapply in 30 days. The rep did start to become ugly and when I nicely asked for a manager he stated there is no one in charge to speak to because its a Saturday."
Richard H,Wow it was so easy. Didn't have a hard to get approved.  I would recommend everyone to cashNetusa...i got the money really fast....would use it again.
customer,Excellent experience
PATRICIA SEARCY,Fast and easy!! Would recommend to everyone!
Martin Montney,"Nice and easy, especially since this was my first time doing this."
Tasha,It was a good experience for me .Got the mone.g. I needed and had great customer help
Margo Ford,Im so mad that they would not help me how can u prove to people u are willing to pay stuff back when they wont help u out i will never give a good rateing
Maria,Whether or not I get approval it’s an accessible App.🇺🇸
Susan,It’s. Truly ridiculous that none of your reps can answer valid questions and maybe not because they do t have the training but because your company is worse than a loan shark. You don’t have a clue about several questions asked because it seems once you got the deal signed it’s f what the customer concerns might be or as a rep put it very unprofessionaly “ cash net gonna get their money first and foremost” I’ve made my payments on time but it seems the company reps don’t have answers particularly because of the daily interest rate. I remember years ago watching I believe mintell Williams who I was once a fan of promoting this company and one of the tv network personnel grilled him about representing cash net because the company was basically raping so to speak customers with out outrageous interest rates that should be against the law. I wasn’t that familiar with the company and I know I needed the money at the time and I signed on the dotted line but never again. I know you are making legal money but you guys should be ashamed of yourselves for taking advantage of hard working customers. On top of it all you cannot answer what I assume to be simple questions pertaining to my account.
Reggie ,Super fast service online. They can very you or if a pickle very fast. A bit pricey though.
Paul Piedmont,"I tried to pay off my loan on the due date, I was placed on hold for 4 to 5 hours at a time... The company wants to take 4 and 5 days just to retrieve their pay back which is horrible. I couldn't believe that I couldn't use my debt card to pay off.."
Chris,Excellent easy worry free not long to process at all
Joni Keamoai,Thank you so much for the loan. I am satisfied. It came just when I needed it. Thank you
Jas,The loan process was easy and fast and I appreciated that. Thank you CashNet USA!
Stephanie Reed,Fast approval and no issues with receiving funds
Me,Great customer service you guys acted quickly I love it thanks very much Cheryl Roth

Janie,Great experience! Processed quickly!
Katie ,I'm very pleased because you are professional people and help everyone.

JOY,"I had a problem with the online application, so I called. Ivan was extremely helpful, knowledgeable and polite. He helped me with the application and sent me further email to finish up.

Iris Delgado,Everyone at CashNetUSA was so nice and very helpful
Larry,I have been on the phone and email with this company for over two months!!!! They owe me a refund of $377.81 for my loan which was paid back twice. Still haven't received my money. I have called and called and called! I would not reccomend them to anyone!

Contacted customer service after my line of credit was approved, because I had a few questions about repayment of the loan. The customer service representative was very friendly and professional.Be aware that the interest rate is higher than borrowing from a bank or finance company. Some people complain about the high interest rate when borrowing from CashNet USA,  but you have to remember that you are paying for the convenience of getting your money faster. There is no BANK or FINANCE COMPANY that will approve a loan application for you within 10 minutes.Will definitely do business with CashNet USA again if I’m in a situation requiring quick cash for an unexpected emergency."

Mamascootr,"After carefully reading all the reviews I decided to give Cashnet a try. They are terrible to deal with within 4 weeks they took nearly $500 from my account when the payments were $110 every 2 weeks(which was also a misunderstanding thought was a monthly payment) .... they take more than what was agreed upon and have for 2 weeks put me in the negative with $72 in overdraft fees.... which they won't pay you back... now next week they want $286 for their 2week  payment which is nearly 3 times my payment. Don't do business with Cashnet... they are thieves. Oh btw, my balance after $500 paid in on a $1000 loan is still at $1200...."

Ashley K.,They were very thorough and very good as for what I was looking for and understanding.
Jamie,"My first experience with CashNetUSA was great. It was easy to apply and get approved. My only advice is to check the day you apply. I applied on a Saturday and was told my loan would fund on Monday but it actually funded on Tuesday. So if you need the money real fast, consider that Sunday and bank holidays may delay funding. Other than that they are accurate  and I would recommend them for short term loans."

Johnny Martin,Absolute hustle I've been paying 200-230$ a month for five months and still owe 100$ less than I borrowed I'm not sure they know how to calculate. I understand how to calculate an annual percentage rate. DO NOT USE THESE PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!
Michael C.,Quick and painless is the best i can describe it.
Jazmin Barnhart,"Done Borrowed once, paid all back and they have the nerve to say they charged me while the money was waiting to clear. 3.18 cents. Screw you, I paid before it was due. Shove your 3 $"
Angel Anthony,"Please I urge you PLEASE LOOK AT THE SAMPLE FEES BEFORE BORROWING FROM THIS COMPANY 👎, These 4 & 5 star ratings have to be paid. YOU will be paying DOUBLE OR TRIPLE BACK from what you borrow! I admit I DID NOT THOROUGHLY READ THE RATES & FEES BEFORE BORROWING FROM THIS COMPANY. I borrowed $700 and have made three payments of over $120 and the outstanding balance shows $986. I was so confused 😕, so I called and was told their fees. DO NOT BORROW FROM THIS COMPANY, YOU WILL REGRET IT! This is my second time sending this TRUE review, they keep deleting it."
Irma,"Since nothing is perfect,  I'm giving you for stars.  Really helped me a bunch.  Now I will see whagt payments and c .service are like."
JO,"Quick, great service"
Michelle,"When I used CashNetUSA the first time months ago, everything went smoothly. I was approved, money was in my USAA account the same day, and my loan was paid back on time. Fast forward to me needing to use their service again when an unexpected vehicle expense came up and I needed a little extra cash to get me through til payday less than 5 days away. Imagine my shock when I was declined for $100 loan (minimum amount) even though my circumstances have not changed at all since I was APPROVED the last time. Same job for the past 9 years, and no changes with my credit  (USAA monitors through Experian). I called and was not given a reason and that I would receive an email. The email stated 3 reasons 1. They couldn't verify my identity (What??) 2. Limited credit experience (Huh?} Over 10 yrs, apartment in my name, car payment in my name, /bills all in my name, Capital One MC (that I ended up having to use because of your denial) 3. Not enough credit references (Say What?) Refer to #2. I now use Earnin which allows you to borrow off your paycheck for a small loan. I prefer to use this instead of my Capital One credit card to avoid the interest.  No hassle and No credit BS. I have a large social media following and I will be telling all my followers on all my platforms about my horrible experience with your company. You have no loyalty to your customers!"
LUCILLE D,Quick and easy. Love the credit line without a card.
James,"Super easy, super fast, and hassle free!"
Curt,These people are loan sharks.  Yeah they’ll hide you the money but you better pay it back the next day.  You accrue interest daily!!!!!!!!!! They are just like title loan businesses.  It should be illegal!And I don’t plan on responding to any of their messages. I’m telling you do not borrow any money from Them.
Kimberly Walsh,Thank You! Cash Net USA.
DEONA,Super easy and not trying to put you in to bankruptcy just for needing to take a short term loan.
TONYA LEE,Great experience. Pleasure working with them. Got money next morning.
Michelle Kelley,I have had real bad money problems and if it would not have been for Cashnet USA I would be in worse shape with my credit score Now my score is not too far in the gutter and this was my second loan I will all was need there help to raise my credit score
John Bumgardner,"Quick, easy and helpful customer service"
Sandra Moxley,First they said I was approved and the money would be in my bank the next day . Then they sent me a denial email after I sent them all my personal information.  I think they are frauds and all the good reviews were done by their own people they are liers!
Linda,"First they said I got denied, then they said I got accepted. I turned down another loan that accepted me, because I only wanted the one. Then they messed up and entered my bank account number wrong. They said they just needed to update my info then I could get my funds. They updated my info then told me i was denied again. I went and got another loan elsewhere."
Andrea Medford,Cashnetusa is very good online loan. Thank u for working with me and helping me out. I got the money posted right away into my acct and the process want a Hassel it's very easy to apply. I was in need of a loan bad and I heard about them through my friend and I'm glad he told me about this lender... The interest ain't that bad other loan places want 3xs the amount which I think is crazy but not cashnet their reasonable. I highly recommend them.

Jacqueline  T Smith,My experience was fast and easy. Very nice person I spoke with. I wouldn't  hesitate to come back. Thanks
Deborah Kylmanen,"Communication with CashNetUSA is nearly impossible. They ""Return to Sender"" my mailings. Customer service promises to return phone calls, never happens. 325% interest rate makes repayment nearly impossible.We initially  borrowed $1,250 and actually repaid $2,043 to close the account. If you can find another source for a loan, use the other source."
Jackson Prater,The application process was easy but I don't know if I got the loan or not. Will you send me a message telling me yes or no?

BARRY,"The experience was so positive. I had results immediately and was able to cash out some of the money needed. Since I had requested early enough in the day, my line of credit was in my bank by early afternoon. It was fantastic!"
DAVID,Paid $600 and still not going toward the 1500 loan I made.  Horrible. Kashable is way better. Don’t answer the phone.  Balance goes up not down.
Maria,"Never get a line of credit from Cashnet USA. I’ve paid about $6,000 for a $2500 dollar loan and have still only paid half of the balance. They won’t setup payments that actually go to the balance, so they make paying it off very difficult. My payments started at $400 bi weekly and have decreased to $175 bi weekly. It’s a rip off! Save your money!!!! Be patient and save what you need to pay your bills."
Clifford,Awesome how it works
Florina Mata,They offer reliable and friendly service. They can work with you. They have been helpful. William
Audrey,It was great a big help during my financial situations! I love Cashnet USA!!!!

John Cobb,I could never get  approved for a loan but you guys made it happen thanks a lot ! I will be paying back in full on my due date and maybe get some more loans in the future 😉
Eugene Gasperi,Was easy getting the loan the reason I gave 5 stars but I would drop it back down to one because they stop loaning to Ohio residents and this isn't fair for someone that was a loyal customer and would still need that loan. Now I have to worry about going to other places and other websites in hope that the site isn't a fake website taking my information for thier pleasure. I had to close one of my bank account out because they (the fake website) have my bank information. The pay backs were high but that money I needed was all what it paid for. I would loan again if they ever loan to Ohio residents again.
Andrea Williams,Would give a different rating if was available in texas
WANDA,I needed cash and you helped me out fast and easy.. Thank you so much
Yessamine Jackson,Was approved for loan went to verify account and was told I needed to send 100 dollars to verify account out of my pocket. This comes down to spam seeing was told no money up front not very good business to work with.
Patricia Schmelter Brodin,"Cashier was very concern about helping me,and solving my problem."

Anastasia Harrison,Omgggggg so Convenient.... not 1 Hassle
WILLIAM PORTER,Had no problem I love y'all service. Quit and easy
customer,"If it were possible I'd give 0 stars, this is by far the absolute worst company in existence! The loan is extremely easy to get but just as hard if not harder to pay off, when you make a payment your balance goes up instead of down. When called for payoff and address to send we were given a Dallas address (then according to customer service rep they send to Chicago so they can collect more fees) which is where we mailed payoff amount we were given. The check cleared our bank four days later but eight days later and our account has not been updated as a matter of fact we are told that account is past due and cash net attempted to pull a payment out of our bank account, we had to spend $32 to prevent it from being debited because it would have taken 10 to 14 days for a refund should payment have gone through. Keep in mind account has been paid off. Calling customer service is a complete joke I was on hold for 46 minutes today before I gave up!!!"
Tiffany,Thanks for the Cash
AMONDO,Quick and easy! Thank you for the help. I wish I could have qualified for more but something is better than nothing I guess.

Wanda,"FEES: to costlyI borrowed $1050.00, my balance today is $1062.00, I've already paid $425.00 that's highway robbery. 1 month later I'm paying it off, in which normally if you pay a loan off early you cut down on interest and fees, not with this company.  I would not  suggest this type of loan to anyone who's already struggling."

I have not used the credit line in at least four mounts and my payments more then double EVERY MONTH!!!! This is FAIR WARNING people if you are in a bind and need money keep looking because Cashnet USA will suck you dry, it will turn your current bind into a bind that will turn into to one that will last months even years!!!!! 300% interest COME ON PEOPLE! I as a disabled firefighter who was injured on the job trying to raise two daughters alone and I was desperate and got SUCKED IN to a loan that will take me more then a year to pay off, my monthly payment due doubles every month due to 300% interest.

Joellen Pam Montion,I'm not satisfied with CashNet. The information I was given was not true. CashNet took out three payment in 2 two week. Now I'm in the rear with my bank account. I'v been charge a fee because the funds was not there. Now I need help with paying my car note and paying cash net.
Kimberly Albright,Im satisfied so far. Waiting to get info on my repayment schedule.
Mary ,"CashNet takes the time to educate you on what they provide and their service experts take time to understand any questions you may have.  So far, my experience has been very good."
Mary Kennedy,"The fees are exorbitant!  I knew that the interest rate is very high, because that is clearly visible when you apply for the loan. But I didn't realize that there are major fees in addition to the interest!  Looking back at their website, I see that is does say there are fees, but they don't make that obvious when you apply for the loan.I was worried I might have to take my dog to the vet, and so out of desperation, I requested $250 dollars.  But then she started acting better.  I paid back the full amount, $250, in several days.  For that, I got charged $45.  $8 of it is interest.  $37 of it is fees.  No way can it cost nearly that much to process a bank transaction!  That's 5 bucks tops.  Charging that much for a bank transaction is just exploitative!"
shinobi ,"It’s was very simple, enter the information they ask for, and literally within minutes you have your answer weather you was approved or not. Once approved, you will electronically sign, enter the amount you need to draw out from your credit limit and they will deposit directly into your bank account, that easy."
Brenda Reyna,Great very helpful and FAST! HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
D. Broussard,"Fast, easy to apply and qualify!"
Robert Batts,"Used to be a great loan company for fast cash with little repayment fees. Now the website acts weird. It's slow and takes you forever to pay back what you owe. The new terms and conditions are ridiculous. The annual interest percentage rate is 299% 🤯which I have never heard of and does not sound legit at all. I've been a customer for a long time but I feel I am being taken advantage of more than being helped. Not sure if I will ever use yall again. This is very upsetting especially for customers like me who use yall alot. It has taken me over a month to pay yall back cause everytime you make a payment, more interest is added. Sorry to give a bad review but I am very upset. The old way was better and more convenient. Sometimes change isnt necessary."
Damon Chenault,Very business like..answered all my questions.. very nice reps..thankyiu cashnet

Melissa Culp,"I have been a CashnetUSA customer for more than 5 years. I Have had to use them a few times when something out of the blue comes up or my child needed school clothes, scouting dues, etc... I only get paid once a month and sometimes, making money last that entire month isn’t easy. This school year, my child needed a Chromebook for school. Well, I found this out a week before school started and my monthly pay day was a week AFTER school started. So, I turned to CashnetUSA once again to help out. I applied for a $350 payday loan and within 3 hours, I had the money in my checking account! Holy moly! That was FAST; same day deposits are awesome! Thank you for being there for me when I needed just a little extra help. I have recommended CashNetUSA to my friends and family and will continue to do so. These guys are the real deal!!! For my customer loyalty, I get a 25% discount on my loan fees... they reward loyalty and I greatly appreciate it!"
Etienne Jupiter,I loved this company. Fast & easy 2 get approved. Quick deposits && manageable payment arrangements as well.
Jayvian Arceneaux,"Where to begin.  CashNetusa is the worst lender.  Sure they will approve almost anyone...but good luck actually recieving your funds!  I applied for funding on 7/5/19.  I checked my account the next day and there was no deposit.  Come to find out they had the wrong account number in the system.  So I called customer service and tried to resolve the situation. Customer service was horrible. They seemed annoyed that I was trying to resolve the issue.On 7/8/19 I sent and a ACH direct deposit form with the correct account information and routing number. I was informed that I would have to wait until the transaction returned. After waiting a few more days I called my bank, and they said if I were to receive the transaction number from the lender, they could tell me if it had already been returned, but most likely it already had been. So, I called, and asked for the transaction number, needless to say I did not get it, but I got several reasons why they couldn't give it to me, and was told that they were looking into it and would let me know when they had resolved the issue. I never did receive an email or call letting me know they had resolved the issue. However they were nice enough to contact me on 7/21/19 too confirm payment on the advance I never recieved!  After telling them good luck on receiving payment with the wrong account information...they cancelled the payment ach as a ""courtesy"".Fast forward to yesterday, 9/12/19, when I decided to once again give them a chance to earn my business.  I requested a draw, and when I checked my account this morning, there was no deposit.   The reason?  THEY SENT IT TO THE SAME WRONG ACCOUNT NUMBER.  The inept fools never corrected the information I sent in back in July!!!I am beside my self at the ineptitude of these people, the complete lack of customer service, and the non-chalant attitude they have.  They are more than able to contact you too make sure they recieve their money...but they really could care less when the situation is reversed.  Needless to say, they will never get my business again...and I intend on posting this same review on every site possible to warm others to seek funding elsewhere...as well as to warn them of the complete stupidity of this business."
Daniel Schroeder,"This company has great customer service they were able to help me and fast, thanks again"
Haley Green,"Excellent service, especially for people like myself whose credit tanked because of illness and inability to work.  It takes so long to build a good credit rating. One sudden and lengthy illness leads to late payments and almost overnight that credit rating is ruined. I appreciate Cash net loaning me the $300.00 I needed regardless of my rating."

Because they're upfront and honest with the rates and terms, I was able to budget and decide whether it was something i could manage responsibly. Interest is high, but borrow responsibly, pay back on time and things shouldn't get out of hand. It's perfect in a pinch. And grateful for the chance to repair my credit."

My Library,The loans come through really fast. I'm not happy about the interest rate but when in a bind you get what you need. I try not to use these kinds of loans because the interest is so high but if you need it for an emergency then do it but if its not an emergency just wait to payday it will save you a lot of money I've been using them for years but only in a emergency

Johnson Amos,I’m in the process of getting a loan and looked and my money is being deposited in a different account. The last four numbers is the account are not mine. When I sent an email to verify it they responded with an email addresses to the wrong person. I spoke with someone through chat because of the wait for phone assistance. I was informed they could not do anything until the money was taken back out of the account they deposited it in. Then when I asked what happens if they don’t get the money back o was informed that I’d still be responsible. The time frame is 5 to 10 business days. This is terrible service. I needed cash fast for medical reasons for my daughter. I will most definitely be informing my attorney if I’m stuck with having to make these payments.
Douglas Mammaro,I had a good experience. I only needed a small amount till pay day. I requested $200 and got approved for $150 and I have to pay back $170. The process was fast and easy. It only took one day for the money to get in my account. Hoping I won't need to take out anymore loans but if I do I will definitely use CashNetUSA again.
Robert,"This company is terrible, they are robbing people. They charge very high interest and a very small percentage of your monthly payments goes toward principal. They gave me a set Monthly payment amount,  then I checked my account and the payment that was  deducted was double the set payment amount. None of that payment even went towards principal, Do not use this company you will regret it."

Vicki,"I responded to a ""pre-approved offer.""  There was a glitch during the online process and I could not get in touch with customer service.  On my first call, I elected a call back, which was disconnected.  On my second call, I got a message that the person was not available, after I waited more than 15 minutes.  The chat function doesn't work and I suspect that the emails don't go anywhere either.  What a scam and a ripoff!ETA:  I called 888.801.9075 - twice.  See above for the results."
Jamie lack ,"What this company does should be illegal. They rob desperate people by charging 275% interest. Currently, my my $2000 borrow is costing me over $100 per week in fees and interest. There is no way to escape their grasp once you make that terrible mistake. Get your needed money anywhere but here!"
AC,"I have done business with cash net for several years, I have never had a problem . excellent service."

Judy,I have tried to get a loan and I received more than enough income however when I call the customer service the lady was helpful and I have 3 different accounts and for some reason I applied a year before last and then I just recently applied and I was declined why would I be declined if I have more than enough in my account and verifying my bank institution and I'm still decline I think this is really a scam fraud and I'm making sure that my accounts are secured if I have to call report fraudulent activity but I have given up I would never try this CashNetUSA because it is a scam obviously I'm not asking for much when I apply for the loan and I'm still denied when I have more than enough to make installments on my loan why would I be denied unfortunately they can't provide that information as mention from the representative they will have to provide it through email but this is very odd because this is the second time I have been declined and I should not been declined I have bank with my bank institution for over 5 years receive direct deposit and should not have been declined I don't recommend this to anyone especially when someone is in need of a loan and yet still decline fraud all day long .
Ron,Fast and easy
Rainbow69 Drop,Always provide Me with Excellent Customer Service.

Cynthia ,"I have been a customer of CashNetUSA for quite some time and until recently I have not had a problem but this is the first time I had a line of credit instead of a personal loan.  I am very unhappy how CashNetUSA handles their LOC.  They go on a statement basis regardless of the order of the transactions.  I have reported them to the BBB as they are stealing money I already paid off and charging me for a balance I paid off and not just the new draw I made on my LOC.  Once this dispute is handled, I will pay off my balance and never do business with this company again!  Don't do it if you don't have to.  They only care about their money not customer satisfaction as they claim"
Patricia Just,Great place to do Business with  I highly recommend doing business with them ..
JAMES GERO,Was a very easy process. Will continue doing business with CashNetUSA. Thank you.
US,I was very happy with the service and experience i had with this company. Everything was given to me and I was told to read it and make sure I understood before I signed. If I don't understand it is my fault.
Sheliacustomer,it’s good to know that when life hits you there is a company that understands and willing to work with you. I was pleased.
Ana Cabrera,The only problem I had was with the chat service. After I got all the information I needed and tried to put it into practice I kept getting more messages that required me to stop the process to reply. When I returned to the application it had dumped the most recent work forcing me do it over again several times as the chat rep kept on after i told him I was done and explained what his persistence was doing to my application process. Other than the that frustration and I'm sure the person was only doing what he was trained to do my experience thus far has been positive!
Lisa B,Very easy and quick!
Annette Johnson,Very great. They don’t give you the run around and approve instantly!!
Kelly Allen,It actually was better then I thought. I'm just gonna try and pay back asap with that interest rate. Thank you for giving me a chance.

Melissa Delaney,Thank you for helping
Georgia Ferdig,"Getting the cash I urgently needed using CashNetUSA was amazingly easy but most importantly it was fast! In less than 24 hrs from the moment I started the application, I had cash in hand! CashNetUSA was my ""safety net!"" The one aspect that could use improvement is (my) payments. Possibly an online amortization chart, allowing the customer to choose payment amounts which would then calculate how many payments are required to repay the line of credit off in full would make the process/experience perfect....although, from a business/profit standpoint showing the customer how much they will actually be paying back may cause pause, LOL! That would kinda cut your own throat I suppose but on the other hand, if money is needed, repayment amounts aren't significant in times of desperation & need. I suggest ""CashNetUSA"" use the ""Safety Net"" reference in advertising, if so, I'd like my advertising & marketing fee deposited directly into my bank account. 😉"
Latossa Walker,You have help when I need you must .I thank you

The only thing is that I wish notes were a little lower but on a positive note it will only take me a few month's to pay the loan off instead of Year's like with other loan company's. Thank You CadhNetUSA.
Rhonda Cook,"It was a blessing and joy to seeing that I had been approved for my line of credit.

Have your info ready and expect to pay high interest... This is nothing more than a tool , how efficient you use it os up to you( these are designed to pay back as fast as you can)."

Dwayne Holloway,Williams was awesome and very patient and helpful thanks .got my money next dsy.
Maiine,"Quick and easy, done in a timely manner"
Tyrone Bussey,"Horrible! I applied for a small loan and got approved right away all my info was correct down to the income where I put i was unemployed,stay at home mom. My husband brings home very good income our gross income was accurate. I borrow $200 only to be locked out the next day & told my income needs to be verified but I cannot use my husband's even with bank statements, check stubs, proof. Its very frustrating because they approved me, when i pay my loan back they will gladly accept the money but will not allow me to borrow again. I would not recommend cash net USA."
Adrian Arrieta,"The serivce is good, fast and friendly and its suppose to be.  They make it this easy so you can get the loan with ease. But beware and plan carefully.  Make sure if you get a loan from this place you plan on paying it back ASAP! I can't stress that enough because the annual interest rate is 299% and it is accured daily. I have a payment that is processing on the 26 of July, but on the 25th of July they hit me with another interest charge of $183, making my next payment due in a couple of weeks of $270, on a loan of $1600 and now I owe over $2100.00.  This has now become a night mare for me just to bring the balance down so they won't hit you with the daily interest rate. All this is outlined in the agreement, but you really need to have a professional lawyer read over it. They take advantage of people to make sure that you are absolute sure before getting a loan from these people. I wish I never had."

The application process was easy, they are a 21st-century lender because I was able to email requested loan documents to them (no printing out, copying and running documents to some office!), and sign the loan agreement online with an electronic signature.  They are the BEST!  Thank you!"
