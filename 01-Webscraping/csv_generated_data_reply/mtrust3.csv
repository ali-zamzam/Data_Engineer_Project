"Thank you for sharing your experience with us. We are here to help. There are a few reasons your account may have been transferred to Millennium Trust. You previously contributed assets to your former employer’s retirement plan program. However, there was no instruction for where to direct upon your departure. Per government regulations, your existing retirement plan assets were rolled into an independent retirement account (IRA) with Millennium Trust. Reasons the funds were automatically rolled over could include plan balance below $5,000, an outdated address on record, an uncashed check, or because of a terminated plan. Our goal is to reconnect you with your retirement funds. We are glad one of our team members, Michelle, was able to reach you and offer assistance. We like to make sure we are providing the best experience possible and the resources you need. If you have any additional questions or concerns, you can contact us at 877-682-4727 Monday through Friday from 7AM-8PM CT or online at www.mtrustcompany.com/support."

"Hello, We appreciate you taking the time to provide us with feedback.When your funds were being held in a sponsored retirement plan, it’s the plan who is responsible for the maintenance of the account. If you no longer work for the company or if your plan was terminated, they are unable to continue to provide you with that benefit. When the account gets rolled over, it moves into an IRA. The individual is then responsible for the maintenance of the account. The fees associated with your account can be found in the welcome letter you received or accessed through your online account at https://secure.mtrustcompany.com.

"Hello Derik, We appreciate you taking the time to provide us with feedback.When your funds were being held in a sponsored retirement plan, it’s the plan who is responsible for the maintenance of the account. If you no longer work for the company or if your plan was terminated, they are unable to continue to provide you with that benefit. When the account gets rolled over, it moves into an IRA. The individual is then responsible for the maintenance of the account.

"Hello, I’m here to help. There are a few reasons your account may have been transferred to Millennium Trust. You previously contributed assets to your former employer’s retirement plan program. However, there was no instruction for where to direct upon your departure. Per government regulations, your existing retirement plan assets were rolled into an independent retirement account (IRA) with Millennium Trust. Reasons the funds were automatically rolled over could include plan balance below $5,000, an outdated address on record, an uncashed check, or because of a terminated plan. Our goal is to reconnect you with your retirement funds. Our records show that your transaction request was completed on October 3rd and the account is now closed. If there is anything else we can help you with, please don't hesitate to call. We are more than happy to assist.

Reasons the funds were automatically rolled over could include plan balance below $5,000, an outdated address on record, an uncashed check, or because of a terminated plan. Our goal is to reconnect you with your retirement funds. One of our team members,  Pauline, attempted to reach you  today and left a voicemail. We like to make sure we’re providing the best experience possible and the resources you need. If you would like to discuss this issue or have additional questions, we encourage you to contact us at 877-682-4727 Monday through Friday from 7AM-8PM CT or online at www.mtrustcompany.com/support."

"Mr. Schwager, thank you for providing us with feedback.  We apologize that your experience with our chat was not a positive one. Typically, our chat bot is designed to answer very general questions.  If the question is beyond general, you have to contact our client servicing support team's 800 number, which you eventually did.  We can't authenticate clients through the chat bot, so we are unable to provide account specific information.  However, we will follow up to ensure there is not a glitch with reaching a representative immediately if you need one."

"Hello Guillermo,  Thank you for your feedback. When your funds were being held in a sponsored retirement plan, it’s the plan who is responsible for the maintenance of the account. If you no longer work for the company or if your plan was terminated, they are unable to continue to provide you with that benefit. When the account gets rolled over, it moves into an IRA. The individual is then responsible for the maintenance of the account. The fees associated with your account can be found in the welcome letter you received or accessed through your online account at https://secure.mtrustcompany.com."

We appreciate you taking the time to provide us with feedback.When your funds were being held in a sponsored retirement plan, it’s the plan who is responsible for the maintenance of the account. If you no longer work for the company or if your plan was terminated, they are unable to continue to provide you with that benefit. When the account gets rolled over, it moves into an IRA. The individual is then responsible for the maintenance of the account. The fees associated with your account can be found in the welcome letter you received or accessed through your online account at https://secure.mtrustcompany.com. One of team members, Gwyn, attempted to reach you on today and left a voicemail. We like to make sure we’re providing the best experience possible and the resources you need. If you would like to discuss how to take a distribution or have additional questions or concerns, you can contact us at 877-682-4727 Monday through Friday from 7AM-8PM CT or online at www.mtrustcompany.com/support."

"Hello Garion, We apologize for the experience you had. We appreciate you taking the time to provide us with feedbackWhen your funds were being held in a sponsored retirement plan, it’s the ""plan"" who is responsible for the maintenance of the account. If you no longer work for the company or if your plan was terminated, they are unable to continue to provide you with that benefit. When the account gets rolled over, it moves into an IRA. The individual is then responsible for the maintenance of the account. The fees associated with your account can be found in the welcome letter you received or accessed through your online account at https://secure.mtrustcompany.com. One of our team members, Terri, attempted to reach you on August 4th to discuss this issue and left a voicemail. Our records show that your distribution request was completed on August 5th and your account is now closed. If there is anything else we can help you with, please don't hesitate to call. We are more than happy to assist. You can contact us at 877-682-4727 Monday through Friday from 7AM-8PM CT or online at www.mtrustcompany.com/support."

"Mr. Pulham, I listened to the recorded call.  You actually spoke with one of our representatives, Linda, not a Supervisor.  I did hear you ask for her Supervisor's name and that you plan to send her a letter. Based on the recorded call and our records, we sent you the appropriate RMD form to fill out on 3/21 and again on 6/27/22 to the email address the representative confirmed with you on the call.  The form we received was not the correct form for us to process your request.  You indicated you filled out the form we sent to you, but based on our scanned documents, the form we received was not the one we sent to you.  We apologize that we were not able to resolve this issue for you and wish you the best of luck with your retirement funds."

"Hello, Thank you for your feedback. We apologize for the experience you had.When your funds were being held in a sponsored retirement plan, it’s the plan who is responsible for the maintenance of the account. If you no longer work for the company or if your plan was terminated, they are unable to continue to provide you with that benefit. When the account gets rolled over, it moves into an IRA. The individual is then responsible for the maintenance of the account. The fees associated with your account can be found in the welcome letter you received or accessed through your online account at https://secure.mtrustcompany.com. We are glad one of our team members, was able to reach you on July 25th and offer assistance. We like to make sure we’re providing the best experience possible and the resources you need.

We appreciate you taking the time to provide us with feedback.When your funds were being held in a sponsored retirement plan, it’s the plan who is responsible for the maintenance of the account.

The individual is then responsible for the maintenance of the account.

"Hi Brent, We apologize for the frustrating experience you had, but appreciate you taking the time to provide us with feedback. There are a few reasons your account may have been transferred to Millennium Trust. You previously contributed assets to your former employer’s retirement plan program. However, there was no instruction for where to direct upon your departure. Per government regulations, your existing retirement plan assets were rolled into an independent retirement account (IRA) with Millennium Trust. Reasons the funds were automatically rolled over could include plan balance below $5,000, an outdated address on record, an uncashed check, or because of a terminated plan. Our goal is to reconnect you with your retirement funds. The fees associated with your account can be found in the welcome letter you received or accessed through your online account at https://secure.mtrustcompany.com. One of our team members, Terri, reached out to you on July 5th to discuss this matter. We like to make sure we’re providing the best experience possible and the resources you need. If you would like to discuss your account's fee structure or have additional questions, we encourage you to contact us at 877-682-4727 Monday through Friday from 7AM-8PM CT or online at www.mtrustcompany.com/support."
"Hello, Thank you for your feedback. We are glad one of our supervisors, Frank, was able to reach you and offer assistance with your transfer request.

"Hello Sharon,  We appreciate you taking the time to provide us with feedback. When your funds were being held in a sponsored retirement plan, it’s the plan who is responsible for the maintenance of the account. If you no longer work for the company or if your plan was terminated, they are unable to continue to provide you with that benefit. When the account gets rolled over, it moves into an IRA. The individual is then responsible for the maintenance of the account. The fees associated with your account can be found in the welcome letter you received or accessed through your online account at https://secure.mtrustcompany.com. One of our team members, Terri, attempted to reach you on July 1st and left a voicemail.

When you submitted documentation originally, there was a spot over your date of birth that we could not see. This same documentation was sent to us several times.  However, I do see that we sent you a distribution link and you were able to complete your request today. Feel free to call us should you need anything further.  Our number is 877-682-4727 and you can ask to speak with Mike P. who left you a voice mail."

"Hello Sara, Thank you for your feedback. We apologize for the frustrating experience. There are a few reasons your account may have been transferred to Millennium Trust. You previously contributed assets to your former employer’s retirement plan program. However, there was no instruction for where to direct upon your departure. Per government regulations, your existing retirement plan assets were rolled into an independent retirement account (IRA) with Millennium Trust. Reasons the funds were automatically rolled over could include plan balance below $5,000, an outdated address on record, an uncashed check, or because of a terminated plan. Our goal is to reconnect you with your retirement funds. The fees associated with your account can be found in the welcome letter you received or accessed through your online account at https://secure.mtrustcompany.com. One of our team members, Terri, attempted to reach you today to assist with your rollover, but you were unable to take our call. If you would like to discuss your account's fee structure or have additional questions, we encourage you to contact us at 877-682-4727 Monday through Friday from 7AM-8PM CT or online at www.mtrustcompany.com/support."

"Hello,When your funds were being held in a sponsored retirement plan, it’s the plan who is responsible for the maintenance of the account. If you no longer work for the company or if your plan was terminated, they are unable to continue to provide you with that benefit. When the account gets rolled over, it moves into an IRA. The individual is then responsible for the maintenance of the account. The fees associated with your account can be found in the welcome letter you received or accessed through your online account at https://secure.mtrustcompany.com.One of our team members, Myra, attempted to reach you on June 10th and left a voicemail. If you would like to discuss your account’s fee structure or any other concerns, you can contact us at 877-682-4727 Monday through Friday from 7AM-8PM CT or online at www.mtrustcompany.com/support."

"Hi Richard, Thank you for your feedback. There are a few reasons your account may have been transferred to Millennium Trust. You previously contributed assets to your former employer’s retirement plan program. However, there was no instruction for where to direct upon your departure. Per government regulations, your existing retirement plan assets were rolled into an independent retirement account (IRA) with Millennium Trust. Reasons the funds were automatically rolled over could include plan balance below $5,000, an outdated address on record, an uncashed check, or because of a terminated plan. Our goal is to reconnect you with your retirement funds. Additionally, when the account gets rolled over and moves into an IRA, the individual is then responsible for the maintenance of the account. The fees associated with your account can be found in the welcome letter you received or accessed through your online account at https://secure.mtrustcompany.com. One of our team members, Terri, attempted to reach you on June 6th to discuss this issue, and left you a voice message.

Per government regulations, your existing retirement plan assets were rolled into an independent retirement account (IRA) with Millennium Trust. Reasons the funds were automatically rolled over could include plan balance below $5,000, an outdated address on record, an uncashed check, or because of a terminated plan. Our goal is to reconnect you with your retirement funds. Additionally, when the account gets rolled over and moves into an IRA, the individual is then responsible for the maintenance of the account. The fees associated with your account can be found in the welcome letter you received or accessed through your online account at https://secure.mtrustcompany.com. One of our Supervisors, Frank, attempted to reach you on June 2nd and left a voice message. If you would like to discuss your account's fee structure or any other concerns, we encourage you to contact us at 877-682-4727 Monday through Friday from 7AM-8PM CT or online at www.mtrustcompany.com/support."

"Hi Landen, There are a few reasons your account may have been transferred to Millennium Trust. You previously contributed assets to your former employer’s retirement plan program. However, there was no instruction for where to direct upon your departure. Per government regulations, your existing retirement plan assets were rolled into an independent retirement account (IRA) with Millennium Trust. Reasons the funds were automatically rolled over could include plan balance below $5,000, an outdated address on record, an uncashed check, or because of a terminated plan. Our goal is to reconnect you with your retirement funds.  Additionally, when the account gets rolled over and moves into an IRA, the individual is then responsible for the maintenance of the account. The fees associated with your account can be found in the welcome letter you received or accessed through your online account at https://secure.mtrustcompany.com.One of our team members, Gwyn, reached you on May 18th to discuss this issue, but you were unable to take our call. If you would like to discuss your account's fee structure or any other concerns, we encourage you to contact us at 877-682-4727 Monday through Friday from 7AM-8PM CT or online at www.mtrustcompany.com/support."

"Hi Gerald, When your funds were being held in a sponsored retirement plan, it’s the plan who is responsible for the maintenance of the account. If you no longer work for the company or if your plan was terminated, they are unable to continue to provide you with that benefit. When the account gets rolled over, it moves into an IRA. The individual is then responsible for the maintenance of the account. The fees associated with your account can be found in the welcome letter you received or accessed through your online account at https://secure.mtrustcompany.com.We are glad one of our team members, Terri, was able to reach you and assist with your transfer request. We like to make sure we’re providing the best experience possible and the resources you need.

However, I do see your account is now closed and we wish you the best of luck with your retirement funds."

"Hello, There are a few reasons your account may have been transferred to Millennium Trust. You previously contributed assets to your former employer’s retirement plan program. However, there was no instruction for where to direct upon your departure. Per government regulations, your existing retirement plan assets were rolled into an independent retirement account (IRA) with Millennium Trust. Reasons the funds were automatically rolled over could include plan balance below $5,000, an outdated address on record, an uncashed check, or because of a terminated plan. Our goal is to reconnect you with your retirement funds.  Additionally, when your funds were being held in a sponsored retirement plan, it’s the plan who is responsible for the maintenance of the account. If you no longer work for the company or if your plan was terminated, they are unable to continue to provide you with that benefit. The individual is then responsible for the maintenance of the account after the funds are rolled over to an IRA. The fees associated with your account can be found in the welcome letter you received or accessed through your online account at https://secure.mtrustcompany.com.We are glad one of our team members, Yesenia, was able to reach you and discuss your account. If you have additional questions or concerns, you can contact us at 877-682-4727 Monday through Friday from 7AM-8PM CT or online at www.mtrustcompany.com/support."

"Hello,When your funds were being held in a sponsored retirement plan, it’s the plan who is responsible for the maintenance of the account. If you no longer work for the company or if your plan was terminated, they are unable to continue to provide you with that benefit. When the account gets rolled over, it moves into an IRA. The individual is then responsible for the maintenance of the account. The fees associated with your account can be found in the welcome letter you received or accessed through your online account at https://secure.mtrustcompany.com.One of our team members, Terri, attempted to reach you April 19th and left a voicemail. If you would like to discuss your account’s fee structure or need additional assistance, we encourage you to contact us at 877-682-4727 Monday through Friday from 7AM-8PM CT or online at www.mtrustcompany.com/support."

"Hi Sarah,There are a few reasons your account may have been transferred to Millennium Trust. You previously contributed assets to your former employer’s retirement plan program. However, there was no instruction for where to direct upon your departure. Per government regulations, your existing retirement plan assets were rolled into an independent retirement account (IRA) with Millennium Trust. Reasons the funds were automatically rolled over could include plan balance below $5,000, an outdated address on record, an uncashed check, or because of a terminated plan. Our goal is to reconnect you with your retirement funds.  One of our supervisors, Frank, sent you an email if you would like to discuss the automatic rollover process further. We like to make sure we’re providing the best experience possible and the resources you need. If you have any other questions or concerns, you can contact us at 877-682-4727 Monday through Friday from 7AM-8PM CT or online at www.mtrustcompany.com/support."

"Hi Candace, When the account gets rolled over and it moves into an IRA, it’s the individual who is responsible for the maintenance of the account. The fees associated with your account can be found in the welcome letter you received or accessed through your online account at https://secure.mtrustcompany.com. Additionally, electing to have State and/or Federal taxes withheld on the distribution paperwork will decrease the final amount you receive.

"Hello Edward,There are a few reasons your account may have been transferred to Millennium Trust. You previously contributed assets to your former employer’s retirement plan program. However, there was no instruction for where to direct upon your departure. Per government regulations, your existing retirement plan assets were rolled into an independent retirement account (IRA) with Millennium Trust. Reasons the funds were automatically rolled over could include plan balance below $5,000, an outdated address on record, an uncashed check, or because of a terminated plan.One of our supervisors, Frank, attempted to reach you on March 28th and left a voicemail regarding your account. Additionally, your distribution request has been processed and the account is now closed.

When you no longer work for the company or if your plan was terminated, they are unable to continue to provide you with that benefit.

"Hi Katheryn, we apologize for the experience you had, but appreciate you taking the time to provide us with feedback. Per government regulations, your existing retirement plan assets were rolled into an independent retirement account (IRA) with Millennium Trust. Additionally, when your funds were being held in a sponsored retirement plan, it’s the plan who is responsible for the maintenance of the account. When you no longer work for the company or if your plan was terminated, they are unable to continue to provide you with that benefit. When the account gets rolled over and it moves into an IRA, it’s the individual who is responsible for the maintenance of the account.  One of our supervisors, Frank, left you a voicemail last week with his direct contact information if you want to reach out and discuss the account and fees further. You can also contact us at 877-682-4727 Monday through Friday from 7AM-8PM CT or online at www.mtrustcompany.com/support."

"Paul, I’m here to help. There are a few reasons your account may have been transferred to Millennium Trust. You previously contributed assets to your former employer’s retirement plan program. However, there was no instruction for where to direct upon your departure. Per government regulations, your existing retirement plan assets were rolled into an independent retirement account (IRA) with Millennium Trust. when your funds were being held in a sponsored retirement plan, it’s the plan who is responsible for the maintenance of the account. When you no longer work for the company or if your plan was terminated, they are unable to continue to provide you with that benefit. When the account gets rolled over and it moves into an IRA, it’s the individual who is responsible for the maintenance of the account."

"Hello, when your funds were being held in a sponsored retirement plan, it’s the plan who is responsible for the maintenance of the account. When you no longer work for the company or if your plan was terminated, they are unable to continue to provide you with that benefit. When the account gets rolled over and it moves into an IRA, it’s the individual who is responsible for the maintenance of the account.

"Hi Theresa, we apologize for the frustrating experience you had! I see a representative attempted to reach you by phone yesterday to discuss the situation further. There are a few reasons your account may have been transferred to Millennium Trust. You previously contributed assets to your former employer’s retirement plan program. However, there was no instruction for where to direct upon your departure. Per government regulations, your existing retirement plan assets were rolled into an independent retirement account (IRA) with Millennium Trust. Reasons the funds were automatically rolled over could include plan balance below $5,000, an outdated address on record, or because of a terminated plan. If any contact information provided by the former employer plan is outdated or incorrect at the time of the rollover, it may have been more difficult for Millennium Trust to reach you. If you would like a more detailed explanation of your account details, we encourage you to contact us at 877-682-4727 Monday through Friday from 7AM-8PM CST or online at www.mtrustcompany.com/support."

"You previously contributed assets to your former employer’s retirement plan program. However, there was no instruction for where to direct upon your departure. Per government regulations, your existing retirement plan assets were rolled into an independent retirement account (IRA) with Millennium Trust. When your funds were being held in a sponsored retirement plan, it’s the plan who is responsible for the maintenance of the account. When you no longer work for the company or if your plan was terminated, they are unable to continue to provide you with that benefit. When the account gets rolled over and it moves into an IRA, it’s the individual who is responsible for the maintenance of the account."

"Hello, when your funds were being held in a sponsored retirement plan, it’s the plan who is responsible for the maintenance of the account. When you no longer work for the company or if your plan was terminated, they are unable to continue to provide you with that benefit. When the account gets rolled over and it moves into an IRA, it’s the individual who is responsible for the maintenance of the account."

"Anthony, I’m here to help. There are a few reasons your account may have been transferred to Millennium Trust. You previously contributed assets to your former employer’s retirement plan program. However, there was no instruction for where to direct upon your departure. Per government regulations, your existing retirement plan assets were rolled into an independent retirement account (IRA) with Millennium Trust. Reasons the funds were automatically rolled over could include plan balance below $5,000, an outdated address on record, an uncashed check, or because of a terminated plan. Our goal is to reconnect you with your retirement funds."

"Hello, I’m here to help. There are a few reasons your account may have been transferred to Millennium Trust. You previously contributed assets to your former employer’s retirement plan program. However, there was no instruction for where to direct upon your departure.

Reasons the funds were automatically rolled over could include plan balance below $5,000, an outdated address on record, an uncashed check, or because of a terminated plan. Our goal is to reconnect you with your retirement funds.

"Millennium Trust Company performs the duties of a directed custodian.

When you no longer work for the company or if your plan was terminated, they are unable to continue to provide you with that benefit. When the account gets rolled over and it moves into an IRA, it’s the individual who is responsible for the maintenance of the account.

"Thank you for your feedback.  The reason why you received what you did was you indicated for us to withhold 10% for tax purposes.  We are sorry for the extended hold times you experienced.  If you have any additional questions or need further assistance please contact us at 877-682-4727 Monday through Friday from 7AM-6PM CST or online at www.mtrustcompany.com/support.  We received 2 sets of distribution forms.  On January 4th the 1st one indicated no taxes held.  There was an issue with the address on that form.  We received a 2nd distribution form on January 31th with the correct information that indicated  to withhold 10% for the federal tax withholding election.  We are not able to change this election that you made.  We are sorry for the inconvenience, we were following your instructions. Your account has been distributed to you and the account has been closed."

"Hello, I’m here to help. There are a few reasons your account may have been transferred to Millennium Trust. You previously contributed assets to your former employer’s retirement plan program. However, there was no instruction for where to direct upon your departure. Per government regulations, your existing retirement plan assets were rolled into an independent retirement account (IRA) with Millennium Trust. Reasons the funds were automatically rolled over could include plan balance below $5,000, an outdated address on record, an uncashed check, or because of a terminated plan. Our goal is to reconnect you with your retirement funds."

"I see you spoke with one of our Team Leads, Nelly today who attempted to understand how we could assist you with your account. Based on our records, we spoke to you on 1/18/22 and you received the Welcome email the next day. You indicated it took you 3 days to access your account in your review but shared with Nelly you were able to access your account on 1/19/22.  Our call volumes were high on the day you tried to reach us; this is why we have an autocallback feature so you don't lose your place in line within our queue. We are here to help and just wanted to understand how we could assist you.  Feel free to contact us if you need any further assistance."

"Hello, I’m here to help. There are a few reasons your account may have been transferred to Millennium Trust. You previously contributed assets to your former employer’s retirement plan program. However, there was no instruction for where to direct upon your departure. Per government regulations, your existing retirement plan assets were rolled into an independent retirement account (IRA) with Millennium Trust. Reasons the funds were automatically rolled over could include plan balance below $5,000, an outdated address on record, an uncashed check, or because of a terminated plan. Our goal is to reconnect you with your retirement funds.  We tried to call and was able to leave a message.

"Hello, when your funds were being held in a sponsored retirement plan, it’s the plan who is responsible for the maintenance of the account. When you no longer work for the company or if your plan was terminated, they are unable to continue to provide you with that benefit. When the account gets rolled over and it moves into an IRA, it’s the individual who is responsible for the maintenance of the account.  But if you would like to further discuss fees on your account, I can privately message you to set up a time to contact you and discuss in detail. You can also contact us at 877-682-4727 Monday through Friday from 7AM-6PM CST or online at www.mtrustcompany.com/support."
"We are sorry to hear you had difficulty creating your account.  I see one of our Team Leaders, Nelly, left you a couple of voice mails with her direct number.  Please feel free to contact her at your earliest convenience and she would be happy to assist you."

"Hello Noah, when your funds were being held in a sponsored retirement plan, it’s the plan who is responsible for the maintenance of the account. When you no longer work for the company or if your plan was terminated, they are unable to continue to provide you with that benefit. When the account gets rolled over and it moves into an IRA, it’s the individual who is responsible for the maintenance of the account.  But if you would like to further discuss fees on your account, I can privately message you to set up a time to contact you and discuss in detail. You can also contact us at 877-682-4727 Monday through Friday from 7AM-6PM CST or online at www.mtrustcompany.com/support."

"James, I’m here to help. There are a few reasons your account may have been transferred to Millennium Trust. You previously contributed assets to your former employer’s retirement plan program. However, there was no instruction for where to direct upon your departure. Per government regulations, your existing retirement plan assets were rolled into an independent retirement account (IRA) with Millennium Trust. Reasons the funds were automatically rolled over could include plan balance below $5,000, an outdated address on record, an uncashed check, or because of a terminated plan. Our goal is to reconnect you with your retirement funds. I have sent you a private message to further discuss your account."

"Hello, when your funds were being held in a sponsored retirement plan, it’s the plan who is responsible for the maintenance of the account. When you no longer work for the company or if your plan was terminated, they are unable to continue to provide you with that benefit. When the account gets rolled over and it moves into an IRA, it’s the individual who is responsible for the maintenance of the account. Someone will reach out to you to further discuss your account. You can also contact us at 877-682-4727 Monday through Friday from 7AM-6PM CST or online at ww.mtrustcompany.com/support."

"James, I’m here to help. There are a few reasons your account may have been transferred to Millennium Trust. You previously contributed assets to your former employer’s retirement plan program. However, there was no instruction for where to direct upon your departure. Per government regulations, your existing retirement plan assets were rolled into an independent retirement account (IRA) with Millennium Trust. Reasons the funds were automatically rolled over could include plan balance below $5,000, an outdated address on record, an uncashed check, or because of a terminated plan. Our goal is to reconnect you with your retirement funds. I have sent you a private message to further discuss your account."

I can assure you that we do not share your information with anyone.  I see your account is now closed and we wish you the best.

"Hello Peter when your funds were being held in a sponsored retirement plan, it’s the plan who is responsible for the maintenance of the account. When you no longer work for the company or if your plan was terminated, they are unable to continue to provide you with that benefit. When the account gets rolled over and it moves into an IRA, it’s the individual who is responsible for the maintenance of the account.  But if you would like to further discuss fees on your account, I can privately message you to set up a time to contact you and discuss in detail. You can also contact us at 877-682-4727 Monday through Friday from 7AM-6PM CST or online at www.mtrustcompany.com/support."

"Charity, we are here to help. There are a few reasons your account may have been transferred to Millennium Trust. You previously contributed assets to your former employer’s retirement plan program. However, there was no instruction for where to direct upon your departure. Per government regulations, your existing retirement plan assets were rolled into an independent retirement account (IRA) with Millennium Trust. Reasons the funds were automatically rolled over could include plan balance below $5,000, an outdated address on record, an uncashed check, or because of a terminated plan. Our goal is to reconnect you with your retirement funds. I have sent you a private message to further discuss your account.  We will call you shortly to help you with your account."

"David, I’m here to help. There are a few reasons your account may have been transferred to Millennium Trust. You previously contributed assets to your former employer’s retirement plan program. However, there was no instruction for where to direct upon your departure. Per government regulations, your existing retirement plan assets were rolled into an independent retirement account (IRA) with Millennium Trust. Reasons the funds were automatically rolled over could include plan balance below $5,000, an outdated address on record, an uncashed check, or because of a terminated plan. Our goal is to reconnect you with your retirement funds. I have sent you a private message to further discuss your account."

"Hello, I’m here to help. There are a few reasons your account may have been transferred to Millennium Trust. You previously contributed assets to your former employer’s retirement plan program. However, there was no instruction for where to direct upon your departure. Per government regulations, your existing retirement plan assets were rolled into an independent retirement account (IRA) with Millennium Trust. Reasons the funds were automatically rolled over could include plan balance below $5,000, an outdated address on record, an uncashed check, or because of a terminated plan. Our goal is to reconnect you with your retirement funds. I have sent you a private message to further discuss your account."

"Hello Bella, when your funds were being held in a sponsored retirement plan, it’s the plan who is responsible for the maintenance of the account. When you no longer work for the company or if your plan was terminated, they are unable to continue to provide you with that benefit. When the account gets rolled over and it moves into an IRA, it’s the individual who is responsible for the maintenance of the account.  But if you would like to further discuss fees on your account, contact us at 877-682-4727 Monday through Friday from 7AM-6PM CST or online at www.mtrustcompany.com/support."

At Millennium Trust, we pride ourselves in our ability to reunite individuals with their retirement funds and to empower them to then self-direct their own investments and transactions.

"Thank you for sharing your feedback. When it comes to alternative investments, we are bound by the rules set forth by the alternative investment when it comes to liquidations. Everything was moved into your account back in September and we did request a liquidation of the security at that time. Many alternative investments are considered illiquid which means that the holder either has to wait for the investment to liquidate, or they must find a 3rd party buyer to buy the investment from them. I would recommend contacting the investment sponsor to see if there is any way they can make an exception for you or look to see if you can find a buyer to buy this investment from you. I will have someone reach out to you regarding the fees on the account."

Thank you for sharing your experience with us. Millennium Trust offers self-directed IRA's. We do not offer any advice on any assets purchased.

"Thank you for the feedback.  One of our team leads, Nelly tried to contact you and left a voicemail. In regards to notification, your former employer was obligated to notify you at your last known address. However, if you had relocated, you might have never received that notification. For situations like that, there was a procedure established to keep your funds in a retirement account, tax-deferred and penalty free. Millennium, in turn, does searches to try to reunite our clients with their funds. So an address search was conducted and a letter was sent in late July 2020 asking you to contact Millennium Trust.  In January 2021, you verified your profile on line and took control of the account. At your earliest convenience, please contact Nelly back so that she can address your concerns."

"One of our supervisors, Marlene tried to contact you and left a voicemail.  With regards to notification, your prior employer is required to send you notification prior to transferring the funds.

As part of our process, we do search if the address of record is incorrect.  We sent multiple notifications requesting you reach out to Millennium Trust and you did confirm/verify your account information in September 2020.  At your earliest convenience, please reach out to Marlene so she can address any additional concerns."
