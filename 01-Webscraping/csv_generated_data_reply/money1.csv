WILL,MoneyLion Was Believed To Be Yet Another Denied Response For A Reply To My Application. Low And Behold I Was In Astonishment To The Acceptance Of My Thought To Be Declined Application. I Had To Proofread It Three Times Before I Could Comprehend It Was A Go!! MoneyLion Made Me Elated.
Troy Miller,"Remember the OLD saying that The Customer is Always Right. Well, you can throw that $h!t out the window with this BUNCH! Typed a significant date but the horrible mistake lasted 5 months. Which will be corrected."
Elise Bloss,"MoneyLion has provided me with excellent service all around. Starting with my first direct deposit which amazingly started the same week I signed up for it. My investing account just keeps getting bigger on pretty much every purchase and the app layout is easy to use. You can check your balance, track investing, make changes and even transfer funds all within the app.Their customer service team works quick at getting issues resolved with a positive friendly attitude. I will recommend MoneyLion to all my friends and family for all their banking and investing needs."
Megan Kaii,"I turned to money lion for a quick hand with cash, ultimately I've benefited in  few ways from my relationship with them! Super fast & easy & best of all, transparency with everything has been totally respected."
Dani Kay,I am thankful to this website for all of the many features many of which are helping me repair my credit. My favorite feature is the Instacash option which started off with a very small amount and increased each time I paid back on time.
Joann Newsom,I absolutely love everything about Money Lion no late fees overdraft fees spot you money and shake and bake has saved me several times. Customer service always great 😊
Mocha Jones,"I have been trying to delete this account since July and have been unable to. They offered me a $50 advance and every time I tried to use it, it never works. Waste of time and bad service."
amy singleterry,Love MoneyLion! Easy to keep track of what I spend and I can also borrow money from instacash when I need it. It’s easy!
Victor,So I have been using money lion for quite some time. I saw the credit builder on there and decided to give it a shot. My credit score jump up about 47 points in the year I was using it. Worked great super happy.
Gabriela Villalovos Torres,This helps in so many ways. Just with loans and also getting you on the right track. No bank. This is it for you.
Brad Holmquist,"I called to see if my card was still good.i have not used it in awhile. Ure representative canceled my card.I never told her to canceled my card.she couldn't reverse the process .she said she would expedite my card. I'm on disability. I still don't have a card. All my money had been transferred into my money lion account. I still have not received my card. I'm broke, hungry,out of gas,."
Sherry McDonald,This place is still holding my money. I have sent ever document they have asked for and they’re still holding my money. I have stayed on the phone today for two hours and still NOTHING. My rent was returned for NSF because they are holding my money. My apartment complex has given me until tomorrow 10/13/22 @10:00AM to have my rent plus they added 130.00 late fee. I don’t know what to do next they keep telling me to wait 24 hrs. This has been going on since Thursday 10/05/22. PLEASE HELP 😢😢 THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE 😢😢 YEP AND THAT IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN TOLD FOR ONE WEEK NOW. I AM CALLING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN MY AREA IF THIS ACCOUNT IS NOT OPENED BY 1:00 PM TODAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
Martin Cherry,This is the easiest way to get the money you need in an emergency. It also builds up your amount of available money with on time payments. It also has available means to help make you extra money.

Karen Dupont,"I have had an account with MoneyLion  almost a year,it has been a great experience and also a learning experience with all the information on my account side. I just paid off my Credit Builder Plus loan for 1000.00 ,at time of loan I receive 600.00 with 400.00 reserve. I get my reserved amount and the approved me for another loan with no reserve! Money Lion is a great way to build credit and good spending habit. I also get my paycheck one day early!"
Ode,Money lion is a good resource when money is needed and help boost credit score
Alexandria,Money Lion is great!!! They are so considerate and are always willing to help. Paychecks on time and I never have overdrafts thanks to their Instacash option. Thank you so much!
Josh Figone,"Excellent money app! This app offers a lot of services. Including small dollar payday loans and prepaid debit cards. They also offer personal financial education, for a small fee $10 - $20 you'll get to talk to one of their financial advisors that they call ""Genius's."" You'll receive a 1on1 consultation, where you can ask them any question on a variety of topics pertaining to money/money management. I have yet to try it out myself so that's just what I've read about their ""Genius"" service but I will soon try it out."
Jillynda,"This bank gets me!! And is reteaching me finances 101 along the way!  My credit score has went up 40+ Points!! In a couple months I will have a savings, invested in stocks and better credit.  MoneyLion does things other banks do and more for free! #ROAR  $itsmejilly"
VJ,"If you need money in a hurry this is a easy, quick alternative than having to pay bounce check fees, but keep in mind if you get paid weekly it will be taken out your very next check and sometimes it could be the same week you borrow! So pay attention to the pay back date before you borrow."
S Hunter,"Not happy with the dispute process.  There was an unauthorized charge of $300 on my account.  The dispute process is they email you a form to fill out that can take up to 90 days to resolve.   I filled it out, emailed it back.  I didn't get a confirmation it was received so 2 weeks later I called to make sure jt was received.  I was told they have no way to confirm if it was or was not received and I would have to wait 90 days to know. WHAT!  I repaid on $300 I NEVER RECEIVED."
Zack,"So far, it has been a wonderful experience. I get alerts, paid early, and it feels fresh compared to my old bank. 5 out of 5 any day. Oh.. did I mention the investments (easy to use) and cash advances in a pinch."
Denise Holley,This loan company is fantastic I will always stay with this company. Get a loan pay back on time your good to go.never never never will I leave these guys.    You have been very helpful in every way.   Thank you for being there for me THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU

Slim Icard,Helps in a jam think they should raise it to fifty bucks after a couple successful payments without having to do direct deposit tho. Would of gave five if the amount without direct deposit was a little better. Still very convenient so Thanks MoneyLion
The Moabite,"It worked! No cap I was a bit skeptical, given that I’ve had other apps allow me to get my hopes up, only to tell me some variation of now. Money lion put that finance in my account ASAP like Cashapp. I’d recommend."
Billy Windisch,"I first started with instacash  to help with money first pay app that did this for me all the rest would not ,very good customer service so far and I decided to get a roar money account so far it's  very good and I like so far the overall service they give me ."
Deebs F,"Just doesn't seem trustworthy. I created an account and linked my bank account just for them to tell me that my account doesn't ""qualify"" for instant cash. Then, when I went to delete my whole account, it tells me that I cannot delete it but does not give a reason. Overall, very unhappy with moneylion and won't ever recommend to anyone."
ANDREA ,"Once you pay your credit builder off and have your reserve left, they will ILLEGALLY keep your money and if you request to close your account they will close it, but KEEP your money that you deposited!!! ILLEGAL!!!! This literally just happened to me five minutes ago after a nightmare with their customer service"
Craig Bell,They were quick to helpMe with a hacking attack. It’s under investigation as of now. So just the rapidness they started this long ordeal and helpfulness with regaining ownership of my account

J G,Very horrible customer service the agents don't seem to understand what they are saying they are walking through a script it sounds like...  I had a dispute and they did this all backwards they don't know what they are doing....
Rosa Smith,"I needed help and had been only accepted for an amount less than I needed, so I tried Money Lion and was approved for more than the other apps offered and have been using it since. All Thanks to Money Lion and their investors"
Jean Martinez,The app is very easy to use & they offer pretty descent instacash amounts
Vincenzo Lentini,The product is fabulous    The customer service non-existent.  I am trying to make a payment but as usual the app is not functioning correctlyI go to the page contact usIt says click here to chat ( no chat window opens)Call 8887046970   you do not have any option to speak with a human    5 star product 0 star serviceI did get a response from Money Lion but I don't accept it. The question is why is there not any way one can reach a live person  Why is there live chat that does not work?  Again great product zero service

Zach Kronquist,"Money lion comes through for me everytime I need help, my only concern is my rate goes up and down, which is disappointing."
India Eppinger,"I look forward to paying them back and not using them. I’m currently going through an issue where they are changing the amount I can pull out, in the middle of my pay period. I simply paid a small fraction back to have access to it later as I usually do, but now I’m being told I have no access to anything I repaid early until I repay the entire amount. This has never been like this in all the years I’ve used it. Than it took me 30 minutes to get someone on the phone.…..2 weeks later. I recently left a review in which the company responded. This was due to the fact that in the middle of a pay period they would not let me pull out instacash after I repaid. They do have expensive withdrawal fees and use weird marketing tactics to get you to give more by tipping. Granted I only repaid the fraction, that fraction is generally available after repaying it. I do it often if I want to pay it off early and in baby steps . Two weeks later, we are two days out from my payday and %20 of my check always goes into this account. Suddenly today, the company is saying my bank did not release funds. Yes my check is pending or released in any other account"
Anthony Clark,It seems to okay except adding a tip at every screen. If that wasn’t so rude ild leave one. Also my debit card doesn’t work for no reason at all.
Marc Robinson,Great app..it has helpme in tuff spots.highly recommend

rebecca,No complaints so far. Impressive
Brigette Duncan,"Completely dissatisfied and beyond upset with all of my recent interactions with customer service and it’s features. Switched my direct deposit and all my financial activity to MoneyLion yet not eligible for credit builder plus, agents have no capability with anything besides stating to wait patiently for any concerns regarding my funds, agents do not communicate promptly through sms or email, I have received a $335 cash advance plus another $335 advance that totaled about $650 with fees and was paid on time when it was due. Now I am only eligible for half that amount, on payday. There goes all my hard earned money for repayment but not eligible for a similar amount as the previous advance. If I’m in good standing with an institution and never ever late with repayment along with direct deposit linked, how am I not eligible for a much more reasonable amount? I can go all night with how I’ve been unsatisfied and extremely upset with this institution. When my hold of $120 clears a month from now(unfortunately, that’s how long MoneyLion is taking to process such transaction, I will be considering closing my account and returning to my previous institution. At least there the agents are more helpful and punctual. All my crypto assets I had planned to move over to money lion along with my investments will be canceled immediately. I’ve never been so frustrated and unsatisfied with an institution that handles money and cryptocurrencies as I am now. Most problems do not get resolved and I’m tired being left unsure or confused at an institution that has my hard earned money being direct deposited into. I have a lot of thinking to do but if closing this account is what I have to do then I will proceed with it."

Tonja Forest,"I have been using instacash for 6 months or so.  My limit was $165 to 185.  I always paid it back early.  Also I make A DAILY DIRECT DEPOSIT OF $100 OR MORE!  Suddenly my instacash amount is $115!  I call cust svc and speak with Angel.  She tells me that its been reduced because a few repayments ""failed"".  I told her that was a mistake.  After asking her to look my account records she said she sees that I deposit daily and ALL MY PAYMENTS HAVE BEEN ON TIME OR EARLY!  She still can't tell me why my instacash was reduced.  After demanding to speak to a supervisor and being on hold for 40 minutes, a supervisor named Jack gets on the phone.  I let him know I love the instacash feature and have raved to my friends and family about MoneyLion.  In fact at least 7 friends have become MoneyLion customers.  After reviewing my account in a nutshell he tells me my limit was lowered because the higher limit was to ""entice"" me as a new customer and even though I DIRECT DEPOSIT OVER $100 EVERY DAY THE LIMIT WAS REDUCED TO $115 BECAUSE OF THEIR ALGORITHM!  I told him that is not stated anywhere.  He said that the enticement method is told to the customer at MoneyLion's discretion.  If I want a higher limit. I should make my direct deposits once a week or every other week.  THAT MAKES NO SENSE!!!!  MY DAILY DEPOSITS HAVE BEEN FINE TO GET THE HIGHER AMOUNT FOR THE LAST 6 MONTHS!  I let Jack know I was unhappy with this and it is not right that the company ""entices"" (his word, not mine) and then suddenly drops your borrowing power without disclosing this info upfront. I asked him how would he feel if he was the customer?  With that he ended the call and hung up on me!"

Latoya Smith,"MoneyLion closed my account over a month ago and refuse to give me the money in it. They are holding over $8000 in a closed account. This is WRONG and ILLEGAL. I am currently pursuing legal assistance to rectify this problem.Update…MoneyLions response to this review is completely untrue. Nobody from the company is working with me to resolve this is. I received an email yesterday from a Customer Advocate, that stated the decision is FINAL and no one would be calling me on the matter. It was signed by Joe Rook, Senior Customer Advocate."

My Instacash went from $670 down to $395 and their response “ We apologize for failing to communicate more clearly that you were getting more than the standard amount, and we'll take this as an opportunity to improve our communications to provide a better experience   I am truly sorry for any frustration and inconvenience this may have caused you at this time. Please reach out if you need any further assistance.”Reach out for what????  No actual person can do anything because they rely on an automated system which FAILS!  Have tried many many times. They take forever to get back to you and they aren’t able to solve anything!!!!  $275 is a big difference with no explanation"

I use every service they have, Credit Builder, score went up 36 points in 5 months DD arrive earlier than most. Instacash when an Emergency pops up and I have not had a single problem I contact them on messenger and they reply quickly. Buy and Sell all the Crypto currencies, invest in stocks the entire package. Do youself a favor check them out.."

Markus Clary,"Love the financial help Mony lion provides, I recommend Money lion to anyone that needs help with getting your finances in order, and cannot forget about your credit score unbelievable how fast you can increase it with Money lion."
Michael,Quick and easy credit builder....great perks
Carol Yates,Giving them a 1 star is too good.  They didn't do anything about 1100 dollars being stolen from my account.  My account was hacked thru the virtual card that I never used and my phone number changed on the account also.  Then to top it off don't have access to those card numbers but tell u to replace it without getting the full card number.  So with that being said I don't recommend them as they r not a safe company or even a bank. Nobody can do anything but blow smoke up ur butt that they know how u feel when they really don't.
James Bruin,"You need to pay a monthly subscription of $20 to get access to their advances, credit loans and other services. It’s a bit more expensive than other advance/credit building apps available.I give money lion a 3* because of their customer support. Requested an advance that never arrived to my bank account. Customer representative looked into the request and couldn’t find any transaction on their end, but couldn’t come to a resolution to refund the missing advance. I ended up paying for the advance since I had auto pay setup. After multiple emails and phone calls I gave up and moved on."
Cynthia Buster,Always on top of things.
verda crawley,I loved the fact the customer service representative took the time to explain the process and alsi worked with me to get resolution.
Yvonne Bartz,I currently have no issues with this app they are a lifesaver especially when it's critical no run around straight to the point and the money is there instantly
jacob,Money lion is amazing I like all the benefits you have with this account and all the extra benefits I will have to insta cash once I connect my direct deposit to my money line account they are very helpful fast and courteous to resolve your problems and issues thank you moneyline
moni perez,This app has helped tremendously. Kept from overdraft on my bank account and even funded a couple of dates for my husband and I.
JennD,The most amazing company ever. Where have they been all my life.
Belynda Sharadin,I was short on my rent. Was able to get an advance right away.
Chastity Clark,I was promised a boost to $300 if I signed up for credit builder which I never got. Then was reduced to $50 Insta cash.  When I’m done with credit builder I will never do business again. Very misleading
katie johnson,"Very user friendly and helpful, thank you"
Matthew Taylor,Love it super easy and so much in this app it’s freaking amazing and just love this app

Nate Shephard,I'm happy about the app it great app n hope to continue to be with yall
Nayavuvou Bolalevu,Been good so far. Have used the app for about 6 months without issue. Would definitely recommend.
Nicky,Good but won't increase your limit unless you open a money account with them.
Matt Oshiro,"If you are starving like a lion in Africa , this app will help you feed your hungry for whatever you are craving with an advance through their instacash service's. The Money lion is there for you to make it to your next payday. The cash advances start off small but quickly build up to $300 in just a few payment's."
Rebecca Edwards,Great experience helped in many ways emergency finds quick and easy and continues to help build credit in a positive stress free way.
Debra Corriea,"Unfortunately I can't give a good review. I was a moneylion user, and one in good standing at that.i always paid back on time and worked my advance total up. But then the app asked me to ID verify. I had no problem with this. I took the photo of my id. The app wouldn't accept the photo. I tried uploading five times to get the same result. After the money lion app wouldn't accept my id they disqualified me. I have spoken to first level customer service and they say there's nothing they can do. I asked for contact by a supervisor who can give me an explanation of the problem. They wouldn't do that either. I asked to close my account and to take my information out of their system since I can't use it. They won't do that either. So basically I have a useless app on my phone that I can't get rid of or use. No communication to understand the problem and possibly resolve it. All they left me with is a struggle. That money helped my family in between checks and it hurt us when it dried up for no reason. Frankly I'm angry about it and I want a resolution. Either the account closed and deleted or the problem fixed. Certainly since I am not the cause of the problem in the first place."
vernon johnson,Great service and a pleasure to work with you!
Gianna Moate,Super helpful and easy to use. Low monthly payments and overall amazing customer service.
Treena Lewis,"As a veteran I’ve had to look for a bank that has everything I need as my work keeps me traveling even in my civilian life now. I’ve had usaa navy fed, chime etc. MoneyLion checks all the boxes. best bank I’ve had since I was 17yo. Hopefully I can win one of their contest soon. Credit Karma is in the running for #1 but I’ll stick with MoneyLion for now."
Danielle Bryant,I have only had 1 issue with moneylion since I got an account and once it got squared away everything else has been awsome
Matthew Skinner,"I absolutely love MoneyLion. Unlike other payday loans that start you off with a little help, after you have to pay a membership with them, which in turn, you'll be paying them to get a loan.  MoneyLion started me out with a loan that helped me out. Anyone considering a loan, check MoneyLion out first, you don't be disappointed."
Bryton Smith,"I had fraudulent charges on my account, I asked for help I asked for a replacement debit card which I have not received. I investigated myself and found that these charges were a fraud but your investigation team said they couldn't find anything wrong. I had two high charges on my account, I want my money returned. I've been a good customer with MoneyLion and I feel this wasn't handled correctly."
Ej Ejizzle Henderson,"This is a great way to improve your credit,get a cheap loan and a way to make it between paydays...I had it for like 3 or 4 years and it's awesome 👌"
Melissa garcia,App is very helpful..easy to use and I was able to get a cash advance with no hassle

I definitely would suggest this app and company to everyone who is struggling right now!!!! Love it!!!!!!"
Zena Ruiz,I was recently surprised that I qualified for a credit builder loan. It wasn’t much but as I am in the process of restoring my credit the loan was welcome. It has a reasonable payment plan and the good it will do for my credit is much needed
Zach Stanley,I love the instacash feature as when you don’t have any money till payday is nice to have!

Mandy Miller,Money lion has been a lifesaver idk where often without it!
Trell Manor,Came in clutch a few times with the advances and the credit builder plus loan definitely is helping the credit score as promised.
Jenn Wright-Nisenbaum,"They are the worst bank that I had to deal with, from high interest on Credit building account to charging Monthly fee in top of interest and reporting Charge off a Moth after the loan was paid off completely, calling and talking to some people oversea and being on hold for over an Hour is normal. So if you like to have a bad report in your Credit use money Lion"
Ramona Pipkins,"Money lion has been there for me for several months now. It has been seamless transaction after quick, seamless transaction! I have referred all my friends to use the service to help out in between paychecks."
Deadrienne Jackson,Moneylion is my go to! They are always there when I need them!
Ernest Crank Jr.,I used their credit builder plus loan - paid off $500 off the $500 credit builder plus reserve EARLY and they only sent me $350 of the $500 “loan” that I paid off to not only help build my credit but with the expectation to have the $500. On top of that I paid the monthly $20 fee and the $10 money fee to use their service and to be a part of the credit builder loan program. Once the loan was paid off on processed they have no way through the app to go in and see your processed payments - previous loans - etc. Money Lion is VERY FLAWED and I do not recommend using them - you will be out a lot of time and money.
Lavette,I love this bank they have fantastic customer service they have better instant Cash limits and they have more advantages to build credits I really really love this bank and would recommend it to anyone. I switched banks after 7 years and have put my direct deposit paycheck into money lion because of how much I like them them.
Susan Duran,To me it is affordable the lending is able when I need.  I highly recommend to others
William,It has been a life saver! Very helpful when money is tight!
Perry Mark Anglin,"Very helpful, understanding support. Very smooth experience. Love MoneyLion."
Teontae Edmonds,Helps with credit building and advances if short on cash. Love this app!!
Kelly Mallari,In fact I feel resolved whenever I contact MoneyLion for assistance. They are financial institution to reckon with.
lateissa p Jackson,Thank you money lion for helping me restart my financial security
George Nelson,I had an unexpected car repair come up and payday was still a week and a half away. If it hadn't been for this service I wouldn't have had any transportation to work for a week or would have been stuck using some payday loan at a horrific interest rate. Got the money in a few mins and had my car fixed the same day. Total lifesaver and I would recommend to anyone who is in a can't wait until payday situation.
Kee,To start allegedly in April 2022 I signed up for round up. Nothing was taken out of my account until this past Monday when they took all the money I had left until payday. When I called the representative told me there had been a computer glitch and if I wanted my money back I had to wait 5 to 7 days. Today August 17 2022 I woke up to my money being refunded but then I was hacked by $CohesiveKeagan219. I again called Moneylion only to be told they had to investigate this first and it could take up to 30 days. I was left with .85 to my name. Not even 5 mins later I was down to -.48. I do not recommend Moneylion to anyone!! Their customer service is overall horrible and you are left with no money in your account!
Julie Thompson,"Moneylion is fine unless you want something like to revoke automatic withdrawals from your checking account.  I tried to revoke automatic withdrawals from my checking account, but they only did it for loan payments and refused to stop them for their program fee.  They said it isn't possible as it's done by the system and they can't override it.  I feel that they don't want to risk losing their fee.  Avoid accepting automatic withdrawals as you will never get their program fee stopped."
customer,It's a nice app to build your credit back. It's simple to use and very generous with advances. It's so good that I cancelled any others I was using. Highly recommended!
Joshua,Just the way you guys do better business then other counterparts is so helpful thank you guys for everything.....
Diana,Best company I have received  a loan from. You guys were there during my time of need when I needed groceries etc. thank you MoneyLion
Jaclyn Collier,"Absolutely Love MoneyLion always come thru for me, just repay on time and your loan will increase over time, this app has so much to offer, no issues here🤗"
Dan,Money Loin is my go to. I suggest this to all my friends and family.
Tip Thornton,It’s good ok I need my money
Maksim Zedzinskiy,Customer service is absolutely horrible. They never get anything done and give you the run around for everything. Thought it would be a great idea for instacash and for a minute was going great but after 5 direct deposits they don't even recognize my pay schedule and it's been weeks that I've tried to have the issue resolved. Was told it would be resolved in 3 to 5 business days 2 weeks ago. Supervisor said they'd call me back last week...... Still waiting. Going to change my direct deposit to a different card. Thanks for nothing money lion. Would not recommend.
CJ,"Don't remember who was helping me out but there's a reason why customer care is a thing, we call when we have concerns about something going on that we can't figure out. I had a question about a problem I couldn't fix and the lady that is suppose to be helping me gets an attitude and raises her voice all because I had a question. Straight garbage."
Shametra Prino,"I have many time with this account and have a balance with around 1400USD and my account is just frozen without any explanation so come to support and they just say your account is closed and your money is in limbo and if you want your money please wait 3-5 years to reach to your originator but my money is in balance in this bank and they just no offer any help, the support is just arrogant, take care because they take our money without explanation!"
Melanie Yadao,Great App and really useful and helpful too
Gerardo seym,"Easy to use, I recommend this app"
Joey Brantley,I always get the help I need from moneylion. If you need a reliable source to help you with everything moneylion is your go to.

I highly recommend them.

Tonya Byram-Winters,Helps out when short on cash and gives you many options for saving money plus building credit.
Lisa,Love it and enjoy the experience I had so far the greatest
Kenneth Fetter,I truly enjoy Money Lion. It’s informative when it comes to giving you ideas on how to invest or things you should try to grow financially.

Lori C,"Money lion is the best, I always use them, great customer service, great everything"
Dave B.,"Money Lion help me in a time of need. Also, each time you pay your credit is increased, and it is up to you if you want to accept the full loan. Thanks Money Lion!!!"

brooke gonzalez,I have been with MoneyLion for several years and they have made tremendous strides in terms of customer service and the willingness of listening to their customers.I have and will continue to recommend MoneyLion.
Trisha Langman,Love MoneyLion. Excellent tips for finances and saving.
Vanessa,"I have had my Money Lion accounts for over 3 years now. I've never had any issues that couldn't be solved without a quick online chat with a representative. I have a checking and an investment/savings account. The only fees I have ever had to pay is the $1.00 a month maintenance fee for the handling of my stocks and bonds. They do everything for you. The ATM fees will eat you up if you don't use the recommended ones and it's kindof tricky to fund your account without a consistent direct deposit. I would also advise to keep your account open with your regular 'brick and mortar"" bank because they want you to link your outside account with them in order to do certain tasks that are necessary. The best part is the ""Insta-cash"" loans that you are offered with no interest. You can receive up to $250 in your account, instantly, at any time. I really do Love this Bank!"
Robert Ross,Love it nothing really to say Money🦁 team is the best team I’ve been on in a really long time
Ed Allen,"I found out about money lion looking for a better institution than chime. I Have found it !! I love how it helps you learn about crypto, investing different tips on how to buy a house, build your credit, etc. I am so happy I made the change it has a lot more to offer than chime."

Mary Ayittah,"Been with Moneylion going on two years now, and for the most part was satisfied with their staff and services. Well that is until July 2022. There was an issue with my instacash eligibility amount. Somehow it had gotten switched to my Roar Money account instead of using my external account. Well the income difference substantial. I contacted a customer care agent and was told that he switched it back to my external account and that the insta cash eligibility amount would be corrected back to its normal amount within two business days that was July 6th well here it is August 3rd and it still has not been corrected I get a different story from every customer care agent. I was told this was escalated to their dedicated team whoever that may be more than a dozen times. I have over 24 hours of real time invested in explaining this problem and why there's a difference in the amount and the math that they keep trying to use on me. I've received 20% of my income on external account for over a year. Because of the perks of several of the different products that I use with them. At this point I give up this thing is nearly costing me my apartment as I was given this information so when moving I failed to make other arrangements to pay a electric deposit. Because I figured that the person on the line working for my financial institution knew what he was talking about. but this happened more more than one occasion with more than one agent as I said before I went through this with several different customer care agents and they were all on different page giving me different time frames and different hope to know about. I apologize for the long windedness of this review but as apparently speaking directly to a customer care agents and having an issue accelerated or escalated or prioritized whatever fails to do anything apparently. Except receive emails where they try to break down the math of why my amount is what it is based off the wrong account which was the issue in the first place. Why am I receiving which quite frankly is ignorant emails saying that basically the problem is the solution? Was thinking about moving all of my income into my Roar money account but if they cannot coordinate any better than what I have seen this month I'm a little worried about doing so. I hope this is rectified and they come back to the standard that I received for the first year and a half of doing business with them. This past month has been nothing but what I have felt like are lies and blow off tactics."
James Bennett,"I always know what to expect with my Roar Money account and Moneylion. My deposit always posts exactly when it should so I'm never left in doubt about the ability to pay my bills on time. When the unexpected happens, it is nice to have the flexibility of Instacash. And let's not forget one of the key features of having a Roar Money account, Credit Builder Plus. It really helped to improve my credit score. If it can improve mine, no one is exempt from the benefits of having a Moneylion account that ties all of these features together. I would highly recommend to all of my friends and family!"

I called and inquired on my 250 once I received notifications about being eligible when talking with a representative barely speaking good English he was very smug and proceeded to tell me they were providing more than enough, which realistically is a lie I get paid weekly and would have been qualified for 250 very dissatisfied with his response very bad customer service at the end of the day this isn’t the only application willing to give people money , let alone don’t act like y’all are doing folks a favor that’s what my bank is for if I ever needed a huge favor, I don’t recommend this app.Update 08/10/2022Upon placing my complaint on Trust Pilot the company has retaliated by unlinking my account taking the payout down to 25 when I had been approved for 175 when reaching out to a rep I informed them of an email I received about linking an account I also provided receipts that my account was already linked as I used their app a few times already with no issues up until I raised concerns , the company is discriminatory and will retaliate when they are in the wrong I do not recommend this app try other apps such as Dave. I have enough receipts to report their behavior to the bbb !08/16/2022By far the crappiest company I’ve dealt with they went in an authorized a charge with out my consent to my bank I called and they would not refund the transaction as my bank had me call them back to see if they would reverse the pending charge as it has not posted they have caused me to be charged a fee with my bank due to their incompetence I was not made aware or provided a notice that they would take money from an account that had zero in it we all knows what happens there okay, they wouldn’t know that because of their lack of communication, I talked with two managers and was under the impression I would be refunded and the entire amount would come out on the 26th with the first guy & that wasn’t the case when I called back the second time , this company is a complete rip off that preys on minorities that speak out against their unjust and discriminatory actions then proceeded to show me a document that doesn’t explain anything about the amount they would take, & the time frame they would auto debit an account if it was not payed on time I plan to file a lawsuit against their actions. Avoid this app by any means necessary I wouldn’t wish my experience on an enemy , payday loans any sort of loan would be better than money lion they charge you tips and transfer fees if you opt to not leave a tip they will add whatever amount they want into what you owe, while making sure you do more than one withdrawals to redeem your full amount as you can only do increments of 100. Waste more money trying to borrow and pay back then a standard payday or bank loan, I hope they are shut down in the future and can not cause financial harm to anyone else."
Michele Balzeit,"MoneyLion helps me in between pay days and I love it, will recommend to all my friends & family."
Michael Fibbianni,"The absolute worst, if I could rate 0 stars I would. First I’ve been paying off all of my loans ON TIME, but yesterday when I paid off a loan and requested another one, they decided not to give me my money. I’ve been told “it’s pending on our end” “wait 4 more hours” “wait 24 more hours” and “wait 3-5 business days”, but on my account it still says I have to pay it back. Yes, i’ve been told I have to pay back an amount I NEVER received. This app is a scam."
Nicholas Alvarado,"I love money lion. I've got the referral bonuses, I love roundup, and getting money is simple. The only thing I don't like is the increments of money in which you can withdraw at a time. This is where they get their money and why I never leave a tip. The 7.99 fee per $100 increment adds up. You can send to your bank fee free, but that takes at least 2/3 business days. You should be able to withdraw the amount of your loan. If this were the case, I'd be more likely to leave a larger amount of a tip. But, all in all. I do love Moneylion."
brittany nicole,The extra boosts and weekly advance pay helps me get by
Cameron Younger,"I get my direct deposit sent to Moneylion every pay cycle. I used their instacash feature and have never had a late payment. I recently got a credit builder loan, and this pay cycle, I paid my instacash loan off early. The app said I was again eligible for instacash, but when requested I got an error. When I asked the support chat why, it told me it was due to a “late credit builder loan payment” which is not due for another 2.5 weeks. I called their support line, who told me that even though the chat provided me an explanation in writing, the reasoning as well as the app stating that I am eligible for $355 in instacash — was not only incorrect, but they could not provide me with a reason that I was no longer eligible at all. I also had 13 fraudulent charges made on my Moneylion virtual card. So not only did an entire paycheck get taken in less than 24 hours due to fraud charges, but the ability to access instacash to have any money to use was also revoked, with support giving me ZERO information, and zero help. Do not use this app. It may seem great, I thought it was too for a while. But being a loyal and on time paying customer gets you absolutely nothing and support does not care about you or your money at all! Not only am I out an entire paycheck, but I also have zero support or even answers from the company that is supposed to be guarding my money. Stay away from these guys."
Tammie,One of the best apps that helps you get to next paycheck without breaking the bank as well as giving extra boots to loan.. they are great!
Lillian Contessa - she-her,Great app Has really helped me keep up on my finances . Instacash is also a lifesaver !!
Latisha Whitman,MoneyLion always come in handy when needed
Jason Ferguson,I’ve been using for a long time now had a instacash limit of 585 and all of a sudden was dropped back to 285 and I rely on the 585 amount and always repay with tip my repayment was 650 and definitely repaid and now can only get 285  that’s a 300 dollar cut

Chandler Bishop,I was struggling after paychecks and I looked up cash apps and found moneylion I've been using for a couple of months switching from my bank to this app. Thank you
lacy wolf,This is what ALL banking should be like. Fast. Amazing.
Shawn Hampton,"I have had an account with MoneyLion for a year or so. At first I changed my direct deposit to MoneyLion so I could use their Instacash. What they don't tell you is that Instacash takes as long as three months to receive. I kept the account opened and changed my direct deposit back to my original bank. I then stopped using the account. Approximately six months ago I attempted to link my bank account to MoneyLion and it worked. I was authorized a decent amount. I decided I would send my Social Security retirement to my MoneyLion account for one reason only. They advertise that government payments are received as much as four days early. I am familiar with this type of early direct deposit because my current bank also does that with my Veterans Benefits. They state as soon as they receive notification from the US Treasury Department funds are disbursed. I did research and read everything I could to ensure this would apply to my SSA payment. I should have received early direct deposit today from my MoneyLion account. Nothing!! I then contacted them and was told they had received notification and they would disburse the funds Monday. The representative stated specifically, two days early. I informed her what their advertising stated in regards to government payments and at that time was informed that could take three months to adjust. I feel they misrepresented the timeline completely. I was counting on those funds. It has put me in a dire situation. This is basically a large company attempting to portray themselves as helping. When in reality they ask for tips as much or more than payday loan companies require. As soon as my deposit hits I am closing that account and refuse to deal with blatant deception."
Anthony Johnson,I had an emergency and this app really helped me out a lot!
Arderia Johnson,"Absolutely love money lion app, have not had an issues at all. It has helped me out so much when I have needed extra cash and with the around up and investments it helps so much. Money Lion had been a blessing the last few weeks. So grateful for this app."

J Disotell,Very easy to utilize compared to most apps.
Darrius Cortez,"This app is very predatory, with the tip guilt it gives , the changing the amount it gives you. One week It could give  400 and then the next it gives you 15?  And it doesn’t have a consistent pay back schedule. So it should follow your pay periods but instead it takes it when it wants to . I’m so over it I hate the app. It helped get me out of a bind just to put me back into one ."
Joshua Miller,"If I available for 220, then I shouldn’t be limited to withdrawl in increments.  This is a way to charge additional withdrawl instant fees and tips.  Currently looking for other Insta pays"

ForminArt Moore,I  thought i  can give  this  company  a  chance  the bank  option is  ok  when you with draw more then two hundred dollars red flag also you  have  to pay  a fee to make deposits with them red flag  they deduct 20 dollars of my  account every pay  period  make false late payments. When i  have  my  screen shots they deffered  my instant cash when  they where automatically  taking payments  then i  recieve  and email 7/20/2022  your approved for a loan of $300 out of your credit builder that  i  have already  have with them i click on  the links tosign i recieve an error internet issues is not you  then i contact  the agent and  left  the chat with out resolving my issue . after that i recieve and  email i  then told  them they where  false  advertising  as in  iam approved  for the loan  then remind me of the balance i have well why dont you contact me . And this could have been resolved  then sending me false information i will deffinetly be calling  there corprate office in  regards to my issues and poor customer service  then i told the agent i m in the customers service industry i  will not ever send my client yes your approved then tell them there denied . Please fix this and yes i will remove my direct deposit business with them today if your using them please be care full there is other ways to build your credit .

Richard Hall,"Credit builder loan is negatively affecting my credit. They are falsely reporting a late payment I have evidence ive shown customer support & they don't care at all. Nor are they willing to help. Do not use this app. *edit 7/13 customer service reached out to me, as soon as I sent them picture evidence Kayla closed the chat on me. When I noted this she reached back out & is now refusing to help me. As well as refusing to escalate the situation. Kayla should not be in a customer service position."

Julie Skinner,Money Lion helped when I needed it the most… I’m so greatful!
Shaunicka Cooley,"Money came in quickly and payback was easy with auto pay. There are optional fees for quicker service, but you can also wait for a couple days to avoid them. Have used on several occasions, without complications."
John Crew,"EDIT: Last response from Customer Advocacy""As we've investigated your case thoroughly with our dedicated departments, we continue to stand behind our previous decision and respectfully decline your request to process a refund to you."" Read that and then read the issue below... GOOGLE MONEYLION ARBITRATRATION LOSSES. .Had to pay $70 in fees to my Water company because even though my transaction history, and my bank statement, both showed the funds were there, their system does NOT match what you see. DO NOT USE THIS FOR BANKING. Your account balance is never truly correct, and they stand behind that. I have email confirmation they do this, and stand firm. GO WITH A LOCAL BANK. This is an organization okay with transaction reordering, misrepresentation of balances, and deferring customer service."

Md Rajjak Ali,I Really like money lion. I have been with money lion for 3 or 4 years now. They have so many things you can do to build up savings. Should give them a chance.
Richmond J,I can’t really say too much about this app yet because I haven’t used it much but it seems pretty good I mean I guess I like the round up I mean I didn’t even know they had the round up set up so it was pretty nice to finally have an extra hundred bucks make you surprise so nice when you surprise money and it’s being invested and you know I tried so many different apps where they take my Randolphs and they invest the money for me and I hate it because I would rather invest in what I wanna invest in but because most of the time the people that a mess for me and blues and all my money but I’m actually making money with the round ups on this app so that’s how surplus out I’m sorry I fell  so when I know more about it I will update my review

Jomer sacro,"I was at 600 instacash and they took away from me saying it's computer generated and ""all things must come to an end"" this the treatment I get from being a customer who pays off all the debt when I use the money. It is customer mistreatment."
Amir Hendrix,I had a credit builder loan was great only down fall which is big to me the hold on your money when you make a payment or make a deposit into the account takes over 7 days for anything to post either cash deposit into the account or paying your loan payment is taking out that day but not fully cleared til 7 days later sometimes longer
Patrick Owens,No comment thank you for all the help

Aaron,Money lion has helped me out with some cash advances when I desperately needed to pay some bills and my rent. They do active investing which is really nice with stocks and crypto. You offer banking. I have not done their banking because I am happy with the bank that I have now but if I wasn't I would move it over to moneylion I do recommend money lion
William Ochs,I am very unsatisfied with money lion. I paid my advance early only to be told I'm no longer eligible for instacash.

So decrease makes No sense at all based on what was established and the 20% of income claim.payin and leaving system.Closing all activities Insta cash, Money Roar account, Credit Builder account."
Mar,Good place. Well maintained excellent customer service.
customer,Money lion is amazing! Always there when you need them!
Amber R Babb,i love this app it lets me borrow money helps me save and invest plus i get my check two days earlier
customer,You’re Instacash option is a no go. It can never process the request. So the Instacash option just builds up the amount because it can’t be accessed. You should have an option to turn that feature off as it is always out of order
Chase Albright,Awesome app that actually helps out in times of need!!
Jose Anibal Ortiz,"Amazing no one has been there for me like money Lion they trusted me,when no one did thank you"
rocquel jackson,I love using this app cause it has help me soooooo much when I’m short of money or just need a little extra til I get payed I love it…no interest and no Hidden fees highly recommend.
Charlie F.,"I've had a MoneyLion account for almost a year and in that time I've managed to build up my credit (thanks to credit builder loan) and learn how the stock market works and how to invest. I like the Instacash function; however, for some reason my limit appears to be quite variable despite my never failing to pay the balance in full every pay day (it has gone down from a high of 710 to 510 😕). That would be my only complaint. Otherwise, it is a good app and very helpful."
Deshawn Calhoun,Love this app!!
Michael Read,I love this app
Edric Brandon,MoneyLion is a great financial institution and a pleasure to deal with.  I recommend them.
Kelly Wilkerson,"They took duplicate instacash payments from my account in same day! They processed the normal from my debit card and then today I wake up and they took out the same amount again but this time from my checking account. I received a very strange email from them stating ""Since we have not received your Instacash payment of $***.** that was scheduled for repayment on Jul 15, 2022, we have initiated a withdrawal of this amount from your authorized and linked bank account."" It is July FIRST!! So they took out the payment that wasn't due for another 15 days. They refuse to put the money back in my account today and told me it could take 5 days or so before they can see the payment come through on there end. To top things off the scheduled payment for 7/15/22 is still showing as scheduled so they are going to take it out again!"
Stephanie Potter,I requested instant funds and it still hasn't been deposited.
cassandra,The Instacash loan is great for when you’re in a bind.
Marco Thompson,Very easy to use and payback. Really helps you when u need it
Veronica  Lewis-morrell,"Knowing I had enough money accessible on my card I offered to pay for dinner. I was unaware the card automatically accounts for a 20% tip not unlike a gift card. I had planned to tip more remaining within my card balance and was distraught when my card declined. Fortunately I had cash. Embarrassing and lesson learned. This however is a helpful tool when you run short on cash and need a quick boost in funds. Money is available instantly and at a reasonable fee,I still wish the cash amounts were adjustable not in set increments. I have had to reach out to customer service and they are nice real people that address your concerns quickly and completely.Overall I recommend Money Lion 100%"
bigjeanne,I’ll be honest I haven’t had a good experience with MoneyLion at all at one thing it’s another thing they don’t explain stuff to you by the Insta cash work or just take me to the booze and explain to you get they can take the money whenever they want so explain they give you extra boost but if you spend it and you have money in your account that you put in your account from getting paid if you don’t already spent the 50 or $25 they give you for investing they will turn around and take that money out of your Insta account and then they will erase it out of your account as if it was never there and then try to explain to you that they don’t know what you’re talking about I need a screenshot of something that’s it out that you can’t see anymore my experience with them has been horrifying
Brendan Easley,I wish it was a online Banking 🦁
Jennifer,I saw the ad on Facebook and downloaded the app. It was easy to use and we were able to use the credit builder but the instacash didn’t work for me
Shane Dillard,"I began asking for service, call backs, etc at 15:11 EDT. I’m still waiting on a callback tomorrow, at 13:00 from an Angel S."
Jake Lang,It will give you money. You got to go through 3 steps. 10 first 20 second 30 3rd then you can get 250 on your next paycheck.
Taveri Veneice,I m satisfied  to use Money lion.When i need i can borrow money.If i cant pay back they always  give me time..

Lisy Garcia,My daughter uses the app and got me into. It takes a minute to get your instacash unlocked at a higher rate if you don't have a bank with long history but I like the app. It's helpful when I need extra cash to get me by
Billy Windisch,Honestly this “phone” or fraud cold something in my hands is a tool thing I definitely trust too much. But hey I can be a good ho or anything following this and use secretly something maybe sneaky but it is helpful or seen and/or retaught if need be…
Esai Ojeda,I have been with this company for 2+ years and have only had one other issue however I am now getting the runaround trying to pay off my credit builder loan plus using my credit reserve and have been told several different things by different Representatives. It's very irritating and inconvenient. After this loan is paid off I will not use the service again.
Crystal lynch,I needed help to get back into my account to report my card lost  and to get help get my account straighten our and because I was locked up for a year inside of an institution and can't remember the credit builder and instacash  I'm not going to be able to replace my card or get my account straighten out  I can answer just about anything else but I got told to call back
Jean Craig,The process was fast and convenient! Would definitely recommend it for others.
Amy,So far the experience with money lion has been a great one. They are very reliable. Always there when I need them. Thank you so much for all that you do

Virginia DeBord,My name is Dyasha Gerlds I paid off my credit builder plus loan Friday June 24th. I called ML twice and was given information about my funds and the payoff process and time frame which I was told 4 business days which if we can all count that would be Thursday June 30th Today I called to confirm everything was set up and was given additional information stating that I actually won't receive my funds until July 7th This is fraud. They are stating that my $22 weekly payment is ach and will take business days and then 2 more business days to release my funds. The funds are already out of my account I need communication from someone who can help me and speaks English I will not have rent due to this I can't do that and I will not be played with next im going to my bank to report it as fraud you choose.
Karina,When I first stumbled upon money lion I thought it was a scam. Man was I wrong!
Kristy,Easy to use and so many options to assist you financially.
Zobeida Idrogo Gouveia,This site has always been to me I’ll recommend it to everyone keep up the good service
Heather,"For some reason they attempted to take my loan payment from a savings account vice the selected checking account.  Mt bank rejected this and returned the charge.  Now my account is past due, lost access to instacash and they claim nothing can be done.  They make the mistake and I suffer.  Customer service though very nice could do nothing to fix this.   No calls from supervisors as requested. Update. Still no action on Money Lionsnpart.  No supervisor call as promised 24 hrs ago.  Really disappointed in the poor response of MoneyLion on something that was their mistake. Update. I have filled out their requested form twice and two complaint forms twice still no response fro Money Lion only an email saying my payment was rejected.  This can’t be that hard to fix"
valerie martinez,Amazing as always!!! Will continue to use forever
Cory Barnett,I’ve been using MoneyLion for years and I have never been disappointed. It features long term loans and instacash payout that proved to be very helpful when budget is a little tight. It also features stock and you can invest with very little amount of money. MoneyLion also accepts direct deposits and you will see your money one day early. Good app. Great company. Highly recommended.
Nick Nave,I was able to use instacash at first but once I moved most of payroll over to roar money i haven’t been able to get instacash anymore and none of the representatives could tell me anything to fix it. Never using this app again. I’ve already switched my payroll back over to my other bank so I can close this account out.
Jessica banks,The app is convenient and very helpful customer service I haven't had a problem with them either
James long,"So far so good. Everything as advertised. I had a lil trouble getting started, but I'm up and rolling. Wish I had started sooner, might not be in my current cowinkiedink."

Kayla Lewis,"Very reliable, they helped me pay some bills. Would recommend 100%"
Joshua DeFries,"MoneyLion has been absolutely wonderful. First thing I would like to say is that the customer service is really user friendly, very efficient in rectifying issues, they app is so user-friendly and the instant cash has been helpful lately especially with not working as many hours as I have been in the past because of the pandemic. Really a big shout out to everyone involved at MoneyLion. I can't believe you collaborate with The Champ. Simply wonderful. Sincerely David Spieler"
Kaka P,Man this is very awesome you know you pay back the loan you build up and then after that you can get to 250 if you keep paying it back on time
Uncle Drew,"they have been cooperating with them for several years, so far everything goes without problems and I will continue to work with them."
Jose Luciano,They are fast friendly and wonderful. Highly recommend
Mary Lomax,It’s a good concept but charges way too much money in fees. Potentially getting the client in debt trying to raise their credit scores.

Sean Buckmaster,"I got the credit builder loan of $1000 and it says $875 was sent to me that I have never seen and it says it’s in collections. How do I owe this money that I was never given? Be very leery before taking one of these loans, I have to figure out how to sort it all out."
Antony Griffin,Money lion is great for wanting to get your finances going better.  I love the app and I'm investing even if it's small at least it's something.  Use the app you'll love it.

Carissa Pressley,"They lie.  I had a 620 credit limit i was reloaning to get to a month i was going to pay it off.  Always paid like clockwork. Even got a raise.  Cut my limit limit almost im half, overdrew my account.  No one helps.  They told me they kept it higher so I would  keep borrowing.  Pulled the rug out from under me."
Matthew Keach,There was fruad done on my account and moneylion has been quick to working with me and fixing the issue I would keep recommending this app to all of my friends
Leo Hernandez,"I have been a Moneylion customer for 4 years.   Until recently I have had no issues with Moneylion and have appreciated what they offer.  However, the last few weeks,  I have been dealing with unauthorized ACH transactions on my checking account. I had to freeze my account and open a new one.   I tried several times to update my new bank account information with moneylion and it would not work. I kept telling them the app errors and they would say there are no problems. I had linked my account through PLAID before with no issues. At this point I have no idea what to do next. Be cautious when using this company. They had been good to us until we experienced an issue beyond our control, now they are MIA."
Joseph Oliva,MoneyLion has been a life saver. It has helped me get money instantly when I need it without interest. Super quick and easy and easy to use app.
Daniel Dellinger,"I have direct deposit with this company, when my direct deposit came in, they always debit what I owe to instcash and that's okay,because I was able to get it back,but on June 15th my direct deposit came, they debit my account so I can pay instacash, but this time my instacash still says it was not paid, I was on the phone with them for 3 days still have not been resolved,the worst part is they are taking any money in my roar account and paying instacash, this company is bad for business"

Demetrius Wallace,No problem with a advance anytime. And I like the other options that they have
Ericka Daniels,Moneylion customer service is absolutely horrendous. My account was debited twice for the same amount and they refuse to do anything about it I wound up having to go through my bank and file a dispute. I would not recommend working with this company and wish I had not.
Chante Gary,Excellent way to improve your credit score and to do key investments with your money that will grow!
Jennifer Oliver,"Best loan app ever, they really come through when you need and they’re legit, no BS"
Dina Pablo,Great company that helps you in financial need and also credit needs
Rich Ross,Helpful with allowing me a loan to get my family a drink so that we stay hydrated when Texas weather gets humid in summer. Very grateful for the chance to help the family. Thank you very much. I'm giving a review as my appreciation for this amazing app. Do your best to make smart choices and do your best to repay any loans so that you don't add to your financial burden later when you may need it again.
SW,Has helped me through hard times especially with inflation these days!
Ricardo  Vega,"Great banking app, easy to use and helpful with budgeting!"
Scott Tubbs,I like MoneyLion Lot. Didn’t give 5 stars because it’s hard to tell translations and the transferring sometimes isn’t the smoothest. But haven’t used it for a long time after more experience I think I’ll have it down pack
B Busy,Q good banking app
Meesha M,"This is helpful but every two weeks the amount they allow you to borrow goes up and down. It’s not consistent at all and during inflation prices and the cost of living to go up, when you think you can rely on money lion, it ends up more limited than the 6 weeks you already been using it and paying back."
Rebekah Ramos,Easy and well structured. Money lion is the best!
Mandi,I am not happy with customer service. Whatever you do don't use your card to pay for a hotel. They refuse to remove the hold even though they see the charge processed.
Kenzie Smith,I am loving Moneylion. It has helped me learn alot about investments and also helped me get on track with credit. Thanks Moneylion.
DJ Teezy,"After receiving four consecutive direct deposits from the social security administration, on the same day of the same week each month, despite only three being required, AND being described as “US Treasury SSA Direct Deposit”, I was refused the instant payday loan feature because I “Did not receive three qualifying monthly direct deposits”, and when I questioned this conclusion was informed “although these deposits used the direct deposit system and were deposited in the same manner as a direct deposit, they are not actually direct deposits and are only referred to as direct deposits due to the similar nature of their deposit into your account via the direct deposit method, and therefore do not meet the direct deposit requirements to qualify you for our instant payday loan.”"
Sylvia Williams,Money line is a five-star app. They help you out in ways that you don't even understand or even realize they can. They've got me through a very hard time I just got out of the hospital with pneumonia had to have a chest tube and major surgery and they made sure that I had the money to get what I needed to come home
Floyd Driver,MoneyLion is the best. Thank you for all you do to help the struggling families.
Tina Owenby,Recently I decided to add make my money line my only direct deposit location and it's been more than helpful prompt and simple to access is always someone to help even when I can't utilize the chat never had much luck with AI. If you're looking for a money app to use Money Lion is just about the best one I used so far.
Zach Downs,Money lion has really helped me become more financially aware and concious in my spending and saving. Also broadened my horizons on credit building investing and preparing for the future.
Gail Ross Brown,"No problems, really easy process."
Kevin Lockhart,"When I’m in need of money or short on cash, money lion always comes through. 100% legit"
Tammy Taylor,"I was really in a stuff spot and didn’t have enough for my rent, money lion allowed me to borrow the funds in which I was able to pay back when I received my paycheck…. This help from money lion allowed me to remain stress free"
Andrew Colston,Outside of a small difficulty connecting bank account the app has been 100% as advertised. I would recommend to friends and family.
selena chavez,Excellent bank I give 5stars because you can pay them back over 4 months late and still immediately have access to the insta cash funds and that 8s Excellent
Rex Abbott,Absolutely love MoneyLion ditched all other cards for this one.
Ben Green,"Didn’t really answer questions- address my issues with disputes even though providing proof of fraud. Thousands in transactions and breaking regulations E.They still refuse to credit my account and it’s against federal law to do so. They refuse to prove the documentation to make the decision that it wasn’t fraud even after asking many times as stated in their email to request it.I have reported Metabank to the Office of the Comptroller of Currency, the consumer protection bureau, the federal reserve, South Dakota Banking commission, and The Texas Department of Banking for their complete failure to acknowledge fraud or provide any evidence of their denial of fraud.This is not the first time that MetaBank has done this either in regards to fraud."
Curtis,Love MoneyLion! Easy to use and great insight on credit and investments.
Veronica Escobedo,Had a very good experience no issues at all
Angela Shaw,MoneyLion is the best! They came through for me when I needed it most!
Ant P,"Predatory online checking account! require external linked accounts to use products, solicit signing up for direct deposit to use loan products! Misleading advertising a loan product, that really is a savings account! Offer $125.00 and reserve $875 until consumer pays weekly payments to withdraw full balance from escrow! Calling it credit builder plus loan! JOKE COMPANY! CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS!"
Hailey Sutton,This app is great but I think if they have a secured credit or a credit card on their own would be better IMO.
Marcus Thompson ,Great app.  Very easy process in saving money and investing.
Kayy,I have had nothing but excellent experiences using money lion.
Kat,Great and instant access to instant cash and good time between payback.
James Betts,Very pleased with the way the advances and paybacks are handled.
Noel Luciano,I love this app it does what it says . It's very easy also to follow and understand.
Entertain More,Great app and help when in a pinch. Give occasional bonuses in the mix and it's worth it when you need it most.
Aaron Cherry,I have instacashed over 10 times. Great app! Especially in emergencies.
Chayse Scott,Fast service. Just wish the instant fees were not.so damn expensive

Steve,"They will definitely loan you money, and you will build up a payment history with them.My bank never seems to be able to connect though. When it’s time to pay, they take it out. It’s pretty simple and easy to use.I don’t like that they kinda guilt trip you into giving them a $10+ tip when borrowing. Of course, it’s lower depending on what you borrow, but it’s still a lot for someone borrowing money due to financial troubles. The instant transfer fee is $5.99 and they ask that you tip because it’s interest free. If I borrow $100, tip the recommended $10, and pay the same company $5.99 for an instant tranfer(if I’m borrowing from you, it’s most likely because I need the money asap) , I’m paying 16% interest. You will be asked for the tip before the transaction and again when you try to borrow more money. I do enjoy this app and the money is there when you need it. I’m sure there a bunch of answers to my complaints, but in the end they will loan you the money(extremely dependable if your payment history is good), charge you $2.50 more for a transfer than at an atm, and then send you a sad picture of a worker who didn’t get their tip, twice."
Raquel Ockletree,As long as you got a bank account with provable income they'll hook you up with an advance. And because it's my birthday this month they let me get an extra 25 dollars. As soon as you pay the advance back it's available to you again. Really convenient app.
darry,"MoneyLion is the best app I’ve ever used for short term loans. It beats the heck out of borrowing money from friends and family. As long as u pay the loans back your good and if your payment is late they don’t yell at you or hunt u down for payment, they’ll simply give u a new payment date. Furthermore, after your loan payment is made you’ll be able to borrow money again 😎The Best Ever"
krupt immages,They always look out for you in any situations.
Hillary,"I have had a wonderful experience. MoneyLion has been there for me on numerous occasions. For instance I was out of town and on a budget, my car was towed and I didn't have the extra money. Moneylion was able to give me the money needed."
Corey Orvin,I love the money lion app it comes in handy I love it Awesome
Cheryl Miner,So far things have been good and helpful. And l don’t regret my decision to join the team.
Everetttexas Hatch,"Great instant money in times I really needed it, was able to depend on MoneyLion time and time again."
Mike Struzinski,Really enjoy this app. Love the options for investment!
Shawn Mucker,"This is the most beneficial, convenient and user friendly service that I have experienced online. Monies are received flash fast and the terms for repay are amenable to your budget, even though you have the option to pay back before due date. It's so much better than the 4 payment a month apps that only provide retail sales service. MoneyLion gets you cash when needed. If you do your part, the amount you may borrow increases."
Mark Farley,A little frustrated I could not complete the transaction with the app but I didn’t mind waiting about 10 minutes to speak to someone. Within a few minutes after speaking with her she had my loan paid off and transaction complete.
Danielle Maier,"This Platform is awesome, I've liked it from day one of signing up. Not until recently have a had any hiccups with a breach of my account, but the situation was rectified very quickly, at least most of it. I'm still owed money from an unauthorized transaction but I was told it would be taken care of. I've been able to save money and invest money with cash back rewards and wit round ups. It's been the best banking experience I've ever had."
Harold Canty,"They need to fix the errors that they claim to be having and decreasing amounts for no reason, when the item is paid in full on time everytime.  But they give you the runaround of 3 to 5 days to fix."
Eric Daye,I have switched my banking over entirely to Roar Money! They have provided me security through the transition and continue to provide excellent services and customer service.
Charlene Roseboro,I love that the loan is there every week and that I am able to ise them to invest in market.
Gerrod Williams,It's been the best mobile bank app I have used
Ashley Worley,Great features that help with many financial needs.
Ryan Hosler,"MoneyLion has been a godsend! The app is user friendly, flexible and informative. I’m paid twice a month and when you need funds before you get paid, this is the way to go!!! Also, when unexpected expenses come along, MoneyLion has saved me repeatedly!!! There is great information about retirement savings, good credit practices and crypto. Repayment of funds is in the next month after you borrow. You have the ability to repay in advance or let the app automatically reclaim the funds on a date the app says or you can go in and change the repayment date. This app is very useful. I recommend it."
customer,"Was unsure of a call that I've received saying it was money lying and wanted to verify my personal information. I called back in to the 801 number and was greeted, verified and had my issue confirmed as resolved."
Tina Sills,"I had a good experience, and my question was answered in a quick and friendly, professional manner. Thank you, and keep up the good work."
Robert,Amazing. Super easy to work with and ALWAYS helpful and quick.
ariel Przychowicz,"Easy to Used the Apps and Help me to pay Bills, Thank you Money Lion"
Kimberley Wyche,This is an absolutely wonderful app. Males balancing and saving so simple.
Nicole Barrios,Moneylion advances me cash all the time. Helps me with my bills. This is my trusted mobile banking app. Love it
Arnold Pennington,"What a rip-off scam. They make it sound like the Instant Cash is something you will get immediately. That is not true. It will go into your Roar money wallet instantly, but there's nothing you can do with it from there. I needed money immediately for an emergency medical issue. I thought that the Instant Cash would be instantaneously like they say. You have to pay a fee to get it instantly. I paid 799 the first time. I paid 599 the second time. I don't remember what I paid the third time. The reason I kept requesting additional money, is because for three days I was on the phone, or is it a chat with customer service or a bot.. customer service repeatedly told me that I could get the cash instantly if I went through a third-party app such as PayPal, cash out, or venmo. Moneylion would not linked to any of those and it would not send cash to those apps. They had me spend extra money to get it super fast just so that I would never receive it. I still haven't received it. It takes 3 to 5 days to get into my bank, and that's the only place it will allow me to transfer the money to. I have to pay all these extra fees on top of the amount that they won't cancel. I asked them to cancel all transactions Since I no longer need their money oh, and they say that's impossible. I don't think it's impossible, but nevertheless they won't do it. Nobody knows where the money is that I paid to have immediately. The virtual debit card doesn't work for anything. I don't know why they have it. They say online that you can go to a Allpoint ATM and use it to withdraw cash. That is not true. There is no way that you can do it. I downloaded all these third-party apps, in an effort to link them to moneylion, and moneylion would not linked to them. It did linked to PayPal but it wouldn't send money to PayPal. It wouldn't send money to my debit card because the error message said there was a security problem. It was absolutely no way to get cash immediately and I feel that very deceiving did they write that and their description online over and over again. They also say no fees. Yes there is a fee to get instant cash that you can't get your hands on. The contact list ATMs that they have so many of don't work with the moneylion virtual card. That virtual card is useless. I think it's atrocious that they gave me the wrong information repeatedly and I have to pay for wrong information. It's a rip-off. Don't do it. Don't download the app. I asked them to cancel these transactions that still have not made it to my bank and they won't. I asked them to take back their money that is in their money lion wallet and they won't. They just want me to pay the extra fees. Plus transfer fees. I'm so sorry I ever got involved with this app"
Determined Mind,"I had an issue about my direct deposit. So, because May 30th was a holiday, I thought that I wouldn't receive my pay on time- but I did. Customer service was very helpful with this. I definitely would recommend Money Lion. You will definitely have a positive experience!"
Richard Stivale,Very easy and on point.
April Williams,This app is awesome with a pretty reasonable interest rate guy can actually score to pay back what you take
Rjay Cabalar,"Fast, easy, helpful"
Harvey,Love this app. Simple and easy to use. Highly recommend if you need a small advance before payday.
Joshua Riddle,I love it. Always helps me in a bind. Thank you
Chad Anderson,When bills need to be paid . You can count on MoneyLion as longs as you pay them back
Mc Monies,While getting this loan you can HELP YOUR CREDIT WHILE SAVING AT THE SAME TIME 🙂 A SMALL PORTION COMES TO YOU IMMEDIATELY AND THE REST GOES TO A CREDIT RESERVE ACCOUNT THAT WILL AUTOMATICALLY COMING TO YOUR ACCOUNT AFTER PAID OFF! It's Perfect if your trying to work on your credit. MONEYLION IT SELF IS AN AWESOME COMPANY THE BEST PREPAID COMPATIBLE CARD SERVICES I'VE EVER USED ❤. SIGN UP TODAY AND USE MY ROAR TAG SO WE CAN BOTH GET PAID 😀 YES THEY EVEN GIVE REFERRALS 😀 #$SO SO PRETTY-RE.
Cindy Culbreth,"This is a GREAT app!

I have had to deferr my payment maybe 2x as I have medical issues that cause me to miss work from time to time. The process was simple and easy. I am a single mother that lives check to check and it can be hard sometimes to say the least. Moneylion has been there to get me through some rough times for sure. Thanks, moneylion"
Vic Morrow,I love money lion and the app. It's a really great option for borrowing money when you're in a bind. When you first start your account you may only be eligible for a small instacash amount but if you stick with paying it back and show 3 deposits of your pay checks coming in they will boost your instacash all the way up to 250 dollars according to how much and how frequent your deposits are. I really like this app and I recommend everyone needing a quick money loan service to give money lion a try. You will glad you did.
Laurette J. Martell,It was easy to navigate and you get approval fast and cash fast in my account

Richard,"MoneyLion has been honest, straightforward and a downright Godsend for me.  I am a senior citizen who needed a helping hand and MoneyLion gave it to me, and I apprieciate it.  I have no overdue bills because of the way MoneyLion has allowed me to borrow and pay them back on a schedule that was timely and didn't put me into further debt.  There policies and guidelines, have been truthful and easy for me to follow."
Mark,"They have you set up an account and get all your info just to tell you they can't verify the bank they approved for me to use, therefore I can't access anything in my moneylion app but they still want to steadily send me emails about getting loans or I qualify for this much Instacash but if i apply for it, I get told they can't verify any of my info therfore I don't qualify. They contradict themselves constantly. It's not cool to mess with people who really could use the Instacash to get by until payday or whatever their circumstance."
Courtney Bradley,So after my previous review it looked like money lion was on its way to do something about their useless customer service. Here again my account is LOCKED for no reason I have been with money lion for almost a year and yet again they did it again! THEY LOCKED MY ACCOUNT FOR NO REASON WITH 6000 DOLLARS FROM MY PAYROLL GOING INTO IT THIS WEEK. They had previously done this and again I called customer service and all they can say Is 3-5 days they delay you 3-5 days every time u have a simple conversation that gets you NOWHERE with their team. They already costed me 300 dollars and late fees when they closed my account last week. Today I call and customer service tells me that I NO LONGER QUALIFY FOR THEIR MONEYLION ACCOUNT. NOTHING HAS CHANGED this account had been opened after it was cleared what is the problem now???This process that they have is useless they are costing people money and most importantly time.Their gate keepers at customer service don't have a clue on what they are doing.I guess it's my fault for giving them a 2nd chance.STAY AWAY.
Clolethia Laachridge,Great app.money when you need it occasionally or for emergencies
Chris Rogers,They understood my problem and fixed it for me with empathy and without any Hassel at all.  The real life person I spoke with right away was amazing.  Best experience I've ever had.
M.K.,This advance app is the absolute best advance app I have ever used they really come through for me every time.
ALEXANDRIA PRUITT,"The application is easy to use, many recommendations and customer service is always friendly and very helpful. Love this app."
Ashley Sinclair,"This is the absolute worst company I have ever had the displeasure of opening an account with. To even call it a bank account is bad on my part. I recently opened a money lion card as my options for brick and mortar banks at the moment are limited for reasons I don’t care to get into. That being said I solely rely on money lion for my banking and everyday purchases such as paying bills, buying my daughter food clothing the daily essentials etc etc. Since opening the account for the better half of about 2 weeks, I’ve had over 3 thousand dollars deposited into my money lion account via cash out from PayPal. Never once had an issue. Made purchases daily and even made major purchases with the account including my rent which is around 1400 dollars give or take. Again never having issues with any of that stuff that is until early yesterday afternoon where I received an email stating my account had been locked due to fraudulent activity. Never was a fraudulent charge on my account and if that was the case, I would have most certainly contacted money lion or meta bank on that matter. To cut to the chase, I basically got that issue resolved after hours of aggravating phone calls to foreign representatives who clearly show no sympathy or understanding of how hindering these situations can be. This morning I was unfortunately met with the same issue as the day before except this time my account was apparently closed with 508 dollars still on my account. Tried numerous times to call money lion and nobody is any help. Surprise surprise right? Anyway, upon calling multiple numbers trying to get a hold of someone who could explain to me at the very least on what’s going on I was met with generic pre scripted answers that had little to nothing to do with my specific situation. I did nothing other than use my money lion card and account for your everyday needs, even read the terms of service to make sure I didn’t step out if line and after reading it 3 times over I knew I had done nothing wrong and it was money lion scamming me for 508 dollars. It’s beyond me how a company closes your account and doesn’t let you withdraw funds. Literally the only source of money I had was on here and now I’m in a frenzy trying to situate a mess I didn’t create. If anyone out there has a resolution to this please let me know because I feel so helpless at the moment. I’m looking into hiring an attorney just because I don’t see anywhere else to turn."
Me,Awesome service
Rashaud Estes,"DO NOT TRUST!!! It was good until I disputed $1600 that was fraudulently taken through debit card transactions. I was never alerted, despite having alerts active. Money lion closed my account and locked me out. Said that I violated their agreement. I asked how?? They can't tell me. I asked for my remaining balance but was told that they would ""ATTEMPT"" return to originator. I supplied the information of the original account in my name but they said they won't return it, it will sit in escheatment for 3 to 5 years... Here are some off my emails as facts: Hello James,This is ***reaching out to you with MoneyLion's Customer Advocacy Team in regards to your received complaint.

They can't help and have pre arranged answers. God forbid if I was relying on my money they have to live and survive on....  BEWARE of the LION.,... Don't trust these people. Ranks of pure SCAM with their unethical practices.I asked one question from money lion. Why can't you return my money???? I did not abandon my account per laws of escheatment. Why can't they answer my question??  They have my bank information. They know who the originator is. Yet, they ask that I remove personal information from this review. I don't have anything to hide. They do....no transparency. No answers...I'm not someone who judges but what they do is  wrong. A legitimate banking institution will not deliberately try to keep your money from you. Do not put your money in money lion unless you can afford to lose it. My experience is real and not biased. I actually liked money lion until they screwed me over and now I know they can't be trusted. I have yet been able to speak with someone from money lion who can answer my questions.  Banks are supposed to be trusted with our money. BEWARE of the roaring lion, they will devour your assets..."
Nin CaPOOPs,Great and awesome app. I love the advance amount I receive. It helps out alot! I love MoneyLion I would recommend to everyone! Thanks
Joshua Scroggins,Moneylion lies to customers about early deposits saying they post deposits as soon as they receive them. WELL THEY ARE holding ssa deposits until Sunday the 1st  while all other early deposit banks and cards posted deposits today the 29th. They gave me a reason that was how there system works so my deposit is with the and they will hold it until 2 days prior to the 3rd no matter what holiday or weekend. MONEYLION FIRST LIE AND DOWNALL HOLDING PEOPLE MONEY 2DAYS LONGER THAN all other early pay deposits banks with no real concrete reasons to offer  They lie by saying the don't hold your money and post as soon as received. You are put on shame wall for this big lie false advertising 😒.  Now they do have other great tools associated with the lion and so far those get A+ from me.
Cassandra Johnson,You want to be aking of mane This is the way
Taiwana Cornish,I recently signed up and used insta cash just fine I verified my identity when signing up and my bank. I even paid back my advance early by 2 days now they asked me to upload my ID which I did front and back then my app froze so i restart it and they declined my ID wont let me reupload it or accept any other proof I have which is a lot my id my birth certificate my ss card my address bills in my name. You name it I have it but when reaching out to cs they just said sorry cant help you or tell you why it declined it or how to fix it nor do we accept any resubmission of id on chat its just ridiculous to me that I have a valid id and am willing to provide a ton of proof and they wont even anser emails and chat people are not helpful at all they wont do anything they wont tell me anything and are rude. Moneylion has become another one of those money apps that just dont care about customers especially honest ones just trying to get by that are who they say they are i am really sad over all this.

Scott Devilish DJ Spencer,Easy to link external accounts. The “round up” feature is great way to invest extra change into investment or crypto accounts that MoneyLion also offers.
Marc,Simple easy to use service. Have never had an issue!
Be Truc Chiem,The problem is that was $20 fees every month. There’s no way to account for the way you get the money back. I spent the $10 every day for over 20 days And I didn’t get my entire $20 back. Also customer service is nonexistent and I mean nonexistent. Good luck getting somebody on the phoneYeah the loan is nice but I’d rather get a loan at a higher rate somewhere else and be able to communicate with somebody. I won’t keep any money with themA little money that you get back on transactions is a nice touch though. But you can do that with Stash as well and get actual stock back Not for everybody. They serve their purpose even if it is incredibly annoying to deal with themEDIT: I paid my loan off a couple of weeks ago and I STILL got charged a membership fee LOL
Mike,"There were fraudulent transactions during the thanksgiving weekend on my account. The card was with me all the time and I was in the hospital taking care of a family member battelling covid who passed away that weekend.Long story short, the bank is not NCUA or FDIC Insured. They have no money to give you even if it is not your fault. My entire pay check is gone.The bank refused to assist initially, requested for paper copies, said blah blah blah we are a paper free company.Finally in the mail after 3 months, they say after their investigation they found that those transactions were not fraudulent.Lol, I am closing my account and will stick with other banks that are at least insured."
Venom Donut,They have great benefits. App is easy to use.
Lena Neal,Great customer service and love I get paid 2 days faster.
Cindy Weldon,This app is amazing and I wouldn't trade for the world no hidden fees money always on time and I can even get an advance if need to be
Jackie,"Actually a 3.5 stars. I'm learning things that's a plus. But I'm unable to fully utilize what's is offered. The credit builder, personal loans. I've pd a big support loan off plus 3 collection bills off and raised my score 50+points yet just trying to get things started. I just need to figure out what is for me and what's not."
Deneen capman,It's very easy and fast to use this app
zaneta,Money Lion Is the best borrowing app out there. Aside from the fees for getting instacash right away you do have the option to get instacash for free just takes 2 days to receive the money . They are always right there when I need them. If you are in a bind you can even defer your repayment until your next paycheck. I would highly recommend them if you are in need of a cash advance. They also offer other options like a credit builder card and loan options from other providers. Money lion gets my vote!!
Tequila Burnett,I got my money so fast a quick $200 advance
Randy,A great app. I highly recommend it

Ghost,Been using MoneyLion for a few months now and they’ve helped me every week with something or another. Trustworthy & operational app.
biggboiluis zurita,This app is very easy to use and is super easy to setup. Always easy to borrow.
M Shone,Great app helps me to get caught up when need funds
L Johnson,"Everything about the app is great except the little loans they offer. You can get up to like $300 which is amazing. However, they get you by asking you to “tip” and then you can only get money in $100 or less increments and they make you pay $4.99 transfer fee for instant transfer which, let’s be real here, if you need a loan of $300 you immediately need it. Not in 3-5 business days. So if you need $300 you have to do 3 transactions which means, 3 tips and 3 transfer fees. I feel like this is very predatory of them to do.ETA after they replied I went and looked. It’s not 3-5 business days. My bad, it’s 2-5 business days. I also went to test the whole “don’t have to tip” statement with a $5 loan and while it is true, after you say “no tip” a screen pops up that says “are you sure? It’s how we stay interest free. We recommend a $3 tip” so they guilt you into “tipping” them."
Teri Lewis,"Money lion has been a blessing to me. Instacash is a life saver. You can invest, buy crypto, and all kinds of other helpful financial tools."
William,All time I use my Lioncard. Feel like a champion. Que buena onda Moneylion

james mori,Your representatives are very knowledgeable and helpful.

Rowena,Good Service great feedback.
Nay Crenshaw,Love it!! The best
Josh Stubbs,I used to love the app but all of the sudden it couldn’t detect my income and lowered my amount to borrow.
A Lamps,It's quick easy and useful when you need it!
Shelia Alderson,MoneyLion is extremely helpful!! I don't 1
Latonya Mathis,"I love instacash! It honestly is way better than using the paycheck advance apps. Shake and Bank is another feature I enjoy but I do wish I got more than 1 cent back on my purchases. I've never gotten more than 30 cents back although it claims you could get up to the full amount that you spent. If i spend $50 or more, which I usually do, 1 cent back is just so very disappointing. Also Moneylion is not accepted on most money apps and it's honestly kind of frustrating. Moneylion use to be my only banking app but I can never find Moneylion on Plaid so I've had to open another bank account with someone else. I feel like Moneylion should be more mainstream by now."
Deandre Heartfeld,I really love MoneyLion because I got a boost and then I was able to take out a loan and it’s raising my credit score and they’re just wonderful
Kimberly Reed,"I use money lion as a backup account. Finding out that I use it just a little less than my credit union account. Instacash is a blessing to have in case of emergency. Investment and crypto are note worthy. This company seems to genuinely care about your financial future, which is rare. Thanks a million!"
Gillian Sullivan,"I've been using Moneylion for a long time. I always use their instacash every month to help cover bills. I've paid on time every month and income hasn't changed. They decided to offer me half of what they normally do this month. This is so untrustworthy. When you pay them on time I guess they punish you. Well, I've decided until they raise it back to what I normally get, I won't be paying any of it back. Enjoy that. They punish their loyal paying customers and leave them high and dry at the end of the month. Thanks Moneylion!"
Eric Garza,Even though I've still had issues and knowing that the last major issue will be resolved at some point. This app has been great sometimes I wish it was simpler to understand but I knw I'm not the smartest bulb so :) I still rate this app pretty effecient.
Ronald Hardesty Jr.,Best banking app by far Love it

James Foy,I am really enjoying money lion my only complaint is that I moved my direct deposit over to moneylion so why do I have to connect another bank to use credit builder.
Steven Moore,So far I really like all they have to offer. It was super easy to set up and I was offered almost $200 in instacash just for connecting my bank. I like that I don’t have to sign up for their checking account and get a Direct deposit before they will let you borrow money like most other apps like this. Makes more sense!! They offer investment accounts as well which I’ve been more into lately and credit building options. So far I have nothing negative to report I’ve only been using the app for a couple weeks excited to see what happens.
Anthony Redman,"Moneylion is absolutely great, I’ve also succeeded with everything I’ve been looking for in my bank! Awesome"
Melissa Ekpemu,Very convenient and I get my paycheck a day early… the instacash is a plus feature on the app I really recommend it to others.

Jaime Guzman,"Listen, I tried, and failed, other online banking schemes. Who is not one of those, I ask you? MoneyLion... they are for the underprivileged, the 99% of us who work our tails off and get swindled by the pretentious and uppity bank cats in corporate suits, all the while, we bail out their ""mistakes"" with the coffers our tax portions constantly fill every year, without fail. Predictably, they keep asking for more. MoneyLion, to me, is a real human-being, sympathetic to our plight, with generous pockets, and has a plethora of information on savings, raising credit scores (with action, not just words). They have 1-on-1 consultations about the pitfalls of spending beyond our means and reducing the clutter in the lingo that the elitist use to keep us scratching our heads. I say this: MoneyLion WAS there when my hometown bank of nearly 23 years of banking wouldn't even consider me for a fast cash advance. That hit me the hardest, so I hit back by withdrawing my funds and investing in MoneyLion. You will not regret the service, the simplicity, and the sound of money in your wallets. What does that sound..sound like? CHA CHING !!!and AAAAAHHH!!!"
Sheri Swiger,This is the best I have dealt with I give money lion two thumbs up.
christopher burcham,"if your in a jam and looking for a quick loan no hassle, try it and its your own money your borrowing it from you,you should try it out only down fall is it give you a 100 at a time so you have to borrow over and over with a fee which it adds up. Still not bad you can take as much as your allowed to."
Heather,I'm a widow and single mother of 4 boys I was low on cash my youngest son was really sick and MoneyLion came thru when I was in need of cash to get my son medicine. Thanks MoneyLion I definitely recommend!!!
James Powell,This is been the greatest experience I’ve ever had with the bank ever says artist Bank they’re awesome too but bars like me having to be working on my credit trying to purchase a house it really puts things in perspective for me invest and I could actually watch your money grow it motivates me to invest and save my money cause I’m watching and seeing a movie you know what I’m not even doing anything so it’s kind of nice in the Insta cash feature is the best because they really basic off of you know $20 is not gonna help me do anything you’re not $10 a pack of cigarettes and I have four kids so we’re not even eating but it is so great you know just had this app it really is lifesaver for work at Mom paycheck the paycheck people are that I really wish that it would help far as people with like Social Security
Antasia Williams,Great app for needed funds. Very easy to use
Xquizite Winslow,"Thank u, this is a great help when it comes to fast end easy"
Samantha “Sam” Gomez,This app in AMAZING!! when you need a payday advance for any reason you can have it in your bank account asap with a small fee $7.99 or no fee if you want to wait 2-5 days so you can get up to $500 in do time but to start they will advance you $250 then in a few weeks later you can get another $250 and that’s if you have direct deposits going through you’re bank so this appt is true to its word. I will use this again when I need it again. This app is trust worthy and I give it a 5 STAR  🌟🌟🌟 🌟🌟

Recently i got my first banking product from this financial service and actually now I'm really happy, it's quite convenient though. I was explained how to interact with this credit card and I guess I have never faced such a good relation toward myself. The staff explained all th details and asked me couple of questions. I answered all the questions and then they gave me this card. I use it nowadays and have no difficulties at all."

Tasha Robinson,"I normally do not write reviews for apps like this but MoneyLion deserves it.. I was in a really bad spot short on cash and couldn’t afford another overdraft or a cancellation of service ,and just like they advertised “you can get money fast“.. sounded to good to be true ., we’ll I’m here to tell you it is real!! And all I had to do is follow the instructions they give you and BAM! I was saved ..With money lion not only do you get your money super fast (like In seconds) but you are able to transfer your funds into your checking or savings account, with out all the hoops and run arounds and they let you pick a day that works with you so you can pay it off with your nxt check .. Matter of fact money lion is so good I had my direct deposit from my job going to a account they help me set up and was able to take a loan over 500$ the very same day .I have told everyone I know about them and I think it’s time I told yous as well .. so if you want to build credit, get a quick loan to pay off that pesky bill , or even open a account where your money starts to work for you get money lion it truly is the king of apps I think everyone should have it"

Khadija James,"Amazing customer service….. in a way.  I will not repeat the terrible experience I had with MoneyLion because I initially wrote one on Apple Store and within 1 day, I was contacted by one their reps and they were amazingly efficient at that point in fixing the problem and showed a genuine desire to get all the details of my issue, fixed it promptly and restored in me the opinion that they are just flat out awesome. I have to give a 5-star because if this was an honestly accidental oversight on their part, then how could I not?  I’m no stranger to mistakes either, so this app is awesome in every sense of the word.  Thank you MoneyLion ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

Low fee for instant and free when you have the foresight to do it 2-3 days early - can really be a lifesaver! Also it serves as a connection to lenders and can recommend better personal options based on what they know about your financial situation. No brained to have! Not to mention… CRYPTO!! Everyone needs to be getting in on crypto and they make it easier than ever.
Noe Martinez,Best app to help you better understand credit plus so much more.

You can avoid any fees but the loan won't post for 2-4 days. thanks MoneyLion, you really helped me out."
SurvHunterFTW,Since I've been using them I've never had any issues! The prices is seamless and you have an option to pay what you borrowed back early.  My only gripe is the credit builder loan in which I was only given a portion that they decide when I actually needed the full amount. Nonetheless they are great when you need it and you can borrow multiple times in one day
customer,Thank goodness for MoneyLion quick and easy to setup and helpful to help me save time and money😀
Derrelle Jones,It's a great app that helps in a lot of different ways!!!
Jess Raelynne,This spp is great it has helped my family so much
Grady Demarcus Holland GDHolla,"The only reason I didnt give 5 was how easy it was for someone to get into my account and wipe me clean of my money, take a loan out in my name and add their phone number and bank account too my information and then it took 3 hours to wait on hold to speak to someone to report the fraud..moneylion you did take care of it but I need access to my money back!"
Jay Guys,"It’s nice being able to get instacash to help for unexpected things, however that is quickly overshadowed with other problems. For starters, upon opening an account, I ended up using instacasg right away, though my other account was attached it put it in the Moneylion account, no problem right? Wrong. I did not have a card and I needed the money for a bill that did not take apple pay. Too bad because am not able to transfer money from this account to my chase. I have tried numerous amounts, numerous times and no luck. I ordered a debit card, it has been two weeks and I still have no idea where it is, I can pay back from my personal chase account but can hardly use the money I borrowed. Today I had tried to use my Moneylion digital card (connected to apple pay, I have used it before) it declined three times with plenty of the money in the account. Tried to go back and get an explanation from Moneylion or to see what I did wrong. Have found nothing."
Chazz Risher,MoneyLion is always here to help me when I need extra cash. Will continue to use them and highly recommend them.
Jessica Limon,"I'm very happy with this online banking service. They provide a lot of educational articles on building, repairing, and maintaining your credit.

customer,This app is great
nicholas,This place a scam.  All these reviews are not real.  They will ask for so much info snd run your credit even though it says no hard inquiry.  Even with good credit they deny you! Avoid them at all cost they take all your info and collect things just to get all your stuff.  The reps are not even sure about what’s required to get a loan.  Isn’t worth it keep going snd deal with a reputable place that knows about loans and credentials needed.  Not at all instant or quick they will take you through the ringer over a week or two! Why?

Ella Stephen,"Money available right when you need it, with reasonable fees."
Adelle Hill,"Let me tell you my MONEYLION horror story...I had a perfect relationship with this company, I loved it. I took out 2 credit builder plus loans...and paid them off on time, never missed a payment...I used Instant cash all the time and NEVER missed a payback...I called the company one day to pay off my balance on my Credit Builder Plus loan and the very inexperienced agent accidentally put my account in collections...I was shocked, he kept me on hold for close to 30 minutes in a panic and never was able to fix it. That was over a month ago. I have called too many times to count and they said the same thing to me...""we apologize...its being escalated to a specialized team.."" I have not gotten ANY follow up, no emails and the account is still in collections. Today I was notified by my Credit Bureau that my Credit Score dropped ""29"" points because money lion reported this as delinquent!! I still have no follow-up and no contact from them I called today and they said the exact same thing! I just want to cry right now."
nichole,"You guys are great, fast and extremely helpful!"
Charles,Amazing 👏 money loan instantly
steven,ALL I HAVE TO SAY.. IS THANK YOU..

Brian Davis,I love this money comes when I need it and pay two days early
sherry,Second review! Hands down! As the name say MONEYLION THIS APP LEADS SIMILAR APP EASILY. INVESMENT SERVICES MADE EASY. PARTNER LENDERS. EVEN THEIR OWN debit banking; which can lead you to a 1000$ bonus instacash. Join the pack and Roar your way to financial wellness!
Taria Holcomb,It is okay. The app is informative.
Keisha Williams,"I absolutely love the MoneyLion app!! It has helped me so much by helping me save money with auto-investments, & has helped me get my credit score back up!! I also love their cash-back feature every time I use the MoneyLion debit card, I get cash-back with every purchase. I love that if I’m running low on money for the week, it gives me the option to borrow $100+ if I need it. I love that it helps me in every financial aspect, it’s truly amazing!! I highly recommend this app to anyone!!! It’s definitely worth the subscription fee!!"

nicholas,"Just downloaded the app and without having to attach direct deposit I was able to take out $100.00 and another $50.00. (they allow more for some users but you have to take it out in increments of 100. Solid service so far and loving having the flexibility to withdraw instant cash for a small fee and all they ask otherwise is a tip of your desired amount. Very helpful service, I look forward to continuing to use them and will report back if any issues arise that are not sound or resolved by their support."
irma,Moneylion is always there when i need them

Abby Bergren,I was able to get access to $100 but it took me several months to get it when it should have been available instantly
Hector,Moneylion to me honestly is great. Out of all the other apps I've tried this one has given me the most advances. They are helping me improve my credit score through a small loan I received from Moneylion. The only bad comment I have is that I did apply for a Moneylion card about 2 maybe 3 weeks ago and still haven't received it. Other than that it's great.
ashunti,I love Money Lion. They don't even know just how much they have had an impact on my life!!! Very Much Grateful!!!😎🌴❤️🌄

angel,Very happy customer! Great experience.
TIERRA JACKSON,Works. Trustworthy. Peace of mind.
marcus,"I downloaded MoneyLion a week and a half ago from an ad in Facebook.  What they said in the ad was true.  A very comprehensive app for money.  Banking, short term loans, long term loans and investments.  Probably even more - I keep discovering new things all the time.  I used the short term loan last week and got a couple hundred dollars to get me by until payday.  No outrageous fees, and the process was simple.  Love it!"
markjd,Great service. Fast and reliable.
Kaye zamora,I want to Thank MoneyLion. They are always there when I Need them.
angelia,I had my doubts at first but this is a great app. You can do all your banking and if you need emergency cash they are there for you.
Renee,You're a great service I thank you for being helpful
Cloyo,I like this over other apps like it because it increases your cash advance amount every time you pay it back on time!
Joann,I love my experience with money lion. Very helpful and tentive to my needs.
Pierce,Awesome app for quick cash adavance
Thomas,Really great service! I have only had one issue and that was easily resolved by changing the billing address with my bank. They are fast and have several options that will help you become more financially confident and savvy!
Shannon,"App is great no problems/issues with the operation, ease of use or functions. Only complaint/Issue is when using the Lightning deposit feature the fees charged for the option are steep/expensive compared to other apps that offer the feature/option also the increments can be rather annoying being able to select an amount up to your max or typing in a specific amount would be way more convenient"
Patrice,A horrible customer service left devastated
larry,They let me get a small advance and then I can't even transfer it to my debit card. I spoke with someone and they told me that isn't available yet. Why is it an option if I can't use it. And they couldn't cancel the cash advance so it's just sitting there.
Venessa reynoso,No scams! No gimmicks! MoneyLion saved me with Instacash. Extra cash to get me by!! No hefty fees either!!! I also have an investment account that’s building my credit. Thank you so much MoneyLion!!
timothy,"This is great for when I need to borrow money between paychecks and I personally don't feel that they charge too much to do so because , I mean, they have to keep their business running also and any time I've had any kind of technical difficulties I've always gotten assistance fairly quickly and they've always been professional and friendly"
gary,It’s a very useful app I love that it spaces your money out instead of giving it all to you at once
jason,The app is good for an instant boost for small amounts. The only thing I don't like is they don't explain how they determine what you're approved or if you'll be approved again after repayment. I also don't like that if you get an advance and they offer you a boost they charge you a fee again to receive it and it's due the same time as the original advance.
casey,Good service
gregory,The best service out there easy payments... very very helpful great customer service.. glad I'm a member would recommend it to anyone

Fayzon Turner,I really like money Lion the only problem I've had so far is I can't link my account to my cash app or other apps like it. It always says sorry this isn't supported. Other than that I'm a first time investor and I love how it teaches me this and how super easy it is to be in the stock market.

Hoard,The best in the game

Moneylion not only gave me a checking account, but gave me two loans, and instacash as well. I honestly don't know what I would've done without them. If you want one bank that covers all your banking needs, and has excellent customer service, Moneylion is your choice. I've been with them several years now and they just keep getting better and better."

brittany,I've been buying stuff from ebay getting crypto back like 50% and it's 👍 but last 3 or 4 times I bought something threw the socialgood app I didn't get credit for it I think somebody is trying to hack my phone it's worked fine until recently I've been getting emails and text that I found out is a theif scammer tried to get my bank info that started as a job to put a Dr pepper wrap on my car I've contacted every police scam police everyone I could find searching Google and nothing was done I said I have all the proof I need I was told they said that it ain't a case said me having emails proving it and I don't have a case the scam emails and text are taking all the memory on my phone there's starting to be so many I have lifelock and a few other backups like. Bad credit so I don't have a lot to lose but if I get to meet this trash that will be the last day u breathe this fresh air I'll go ahead and do the world a big favor something that should of never quit
candace,"MoneyLion gives me the ability to get a cash advance, invest, improve credit score, get a loan, buy cryptocurrency, stay up-to-date on financial news and much much more.

rB,Never have a problem using money lion absolutely love this app.  Only thing I wish was different is not being charged for every $100 since I do pay it back on time Everytime I think you should be able to take full amount with only one fee
Bobby Berry Campbell,"Some of the aspects of the website and app are challenging to navigate, but currently I have an issue where my payment which is due in the future is showing past due. Now I have to wait at least a week for it to be corrected by whatever unnamed “team” is responsible for fixing this error because customer service agents that answer the phones are modern day glorified switchboard operators that can’t fix anything just “forward your request to the appropriate “team”, ridiculous waste of salaries if you ask me."

chiara,I love the advances and according to your income they go up or down... I have been loving mines and they really come in handy as well....
Patricia Speed,I left only 2 stars because every time MoneyLion does a software upgrade it locks me out of my account resets the fingerprint settings that I set up in the app and I always have to create another password it's pretty stressful and extremely frustrating.
laurie,I asked for one more day becUse my check was delayed...i called for a week striaght got the run around and they did absolutely nothing...over drafted my account and didnt even care. Worst customer service...and no one knows what their doing.

hershel,MoneyLion is great!! I created an acct and connected my bank acct and had money that I needed within minutes!!
betsy,I can't instacash out to my debit card only to my roarmoney account which then takes 3 to 5 business days because I don't have my card yet. Somehow 100 went into the investment account and now I can't immediately remove it. I am so over this app
RODNEY DORSEY,This app makes the process of a short term cash advance straight forward and very simple to use via the direct deposit feature. Having instant access to cash to help with financial burdens is invaluable. I feel much more comfortable going this route than agreeing to a payday loan. I think the thing that would up my rating to five stars would be the ability to get a larger increment of money in a single transaction.
samantha,Thankful for an app to help when things are tight.
AM,It almost sounds too good to be true if you’re short on money they actually will give you a cash advance their limit start slow and then slowly gradually goes up when you make your weekly payments on time.
rasheed,Love it...Im telling all my friends right now
adrian,Easiest to work with. Shows that being a good standing customer is rewarding

ericka,"I have been trying to get them to rectify a cashbuilder loan discrepancy since November. I have called support, emailed support and chatted with support. The status has still not changed. When emailing support even within the same thread I have to identify myself over and over and over again. I also have had issues linking a bank account and they have disregarded the information I have uploaded to make this happen. It is ridiculous that something that has been “expedited” is taking this long."
carol,My Instacash limit changed dramatically and now has put me in a bind. A 300 dollar change with no warning. Now I must figure out how to feed my family the next two weeks with 300 less than what I had originally

jessica,Paid off my loan in December. Still reporting incorrect payment status and amount owed on all 3 bureaus. Customer service rep who took my payment over the phone assured me balance would be updated to 0 and remarks would read paid closed but that hasn’t happened. Disputed with all 3 bureaus and as of today the disputes were completed and still reporting incorrectly. MoneyLion is ruining my credit. I have the bank statements to prove my payment and even on Moneylion’s websites it shows a 0.00 balance but they are still reporting it incorrectly. I give them 0 stars and stay as far away from them as possible. Terrible company to do business with. I do not recommend.

Mo,"Perfecto great and reliable ,"
Leslie Hollman,"It's been a bad experience overall. I don't feel MoneyLion has my financial well-being in sight. My Insta cash is keeping me in a vicious cycle. I'm on my second credit building loan without any late payments but my credit score actually went down not up.Then I was offered a promo which I made sure I did everything required on my end which is 1)be in good standing with all accounts and 2) deposit $50 into my investment account and get $50 insta cash. I made the deposit but never got the promo insta cash I talked to customer service who told me that they had forward the issue to support and that I would either receive a follow-up email with further questions or I would see the promotion of $50 in my instacash. I did receive an email from support that day and responded within 10 minutes providing them the requested information which was a screenshot of what promotion I was talking about. I never heard back from there I emailed them about 6 times with no response. Then I saw an email stating that I had to use my $50 InstaCash or it would expire I logged into the app(the website has never functioned enough to allow me to sign in) but but it said $0 into cash available. I emailed customer service three or four more times with no response. I then about 3 weeks later got an email from my direct depositor that my direct deposit have been returned from my financial institution. Then my insta cash repayment and credit building loan became in default then I received an email from customer service stating that I was not eligible for the promotion because my current accounts were in default and not in good standing as required I immediately wrote back stating that that's not the case that I wasn't good standing at the time of the promo. I didn't immediately contacted my direct depositor and they were able to reissue my direct deposit but it would take 3 to 4 days and I still have not heard back from moneylion concerning the promo.I had to deal with customer service several times about the website not functioning and I'm always given the same answer ""why don't you just use the app"" I would not suggest this financial tool as a means of budgeting saving money financial advice there's no savings account and the cost of insta cash keeps going up."

james,"MoneyLion is a very fair and convenient ""bank"". Really the only thing that you have to do is keep your account in good standing and your limit will grow. Fast cash when you need it, for a fee or if you can just wait a day it's free. No interest due either. They only ask that idk maybe you leave a tip‽ Non profits gotta get paid so why not MoneyLion as well. If you don't feel like tipping don't, you don't have to. I do however recommend it though, kinda keeps the business in business."

Micheale Chaney,If you don't have money lion in your financial arsenal yet.Consider yourself left behind the times. There's a fintech out there that rhimes with times. Which has a pretty good foot hold thanks to its social media campaign around its spot feature. I'm here to tell you that you do have choices.  Not just money lion but a few others and they all have some form of money fronting and pay early feature. I tried them all. I finally found one that doesn't want my money.  It wants me to make money too. In a multiple amount of ways. So it's up to you. Spend years like a mouse in a wheel or get out n move on.Peace. Jimmy...
samantha,They took all of my money off of my card when I was told that when I pay manually it wouldn't take another payment out until my next payment date which is a lie because they definitely took 2 payments from me within 24 hours
edward,Haven't had any issues whatsoever. They have been a lifesaver so far and been helping me out of a tight spot.
patricia,The instacash feature is simple and gets credited to my account in less than a minute.  I have yet to be turned down  and  Money Lion has upped my limit each time I've used it. The only issue I have is it doesn't stay linked to my bank account and relinking is  often difficult to accomplish.
philip,I was approved for a loan also charged. It takes to long to receive the loan
Latonia Warren,I have been struggling and haven't been able to find help until MoneyLion came around. Thank you so much for helping me.
Jeffery Hash,Money lion does not let you borrow up to $500. Only $250
Kathy Alexander,Best thing ever. Saves my ass so much.

jacob,"Thanks for helping me when I needed it most I really appreciate ya, you’lol Be Paid Back In Full One Love Peace - Ant Bailey"
Chai,The last few people I spoke with about my situation I was having were very helpful especially  the gentleman. The person before these 2 people was terrible. I was in chat she asked me a question and she didn't give 10 seconds to finish my response Then told me I must have got preoccupied with something else and disconnected our chat.
Angela,This is so much more than just a banking app! Whether you need a cash advance to help you out until payday or you're wanting to improve your credit score. This is a great app for whatever your needs are with a ton of helpful advice towards a healthy financial future.
Roxy,Money Lion is Always giving me something fresh and new. Simply the best
Marc Doane,Money lion is good however the app itself freezes often. I think if app got an update it would be an 5 star
SEC,"I recently switched my paycheck deposits to moneylion & I am completely satisfied. Between their Cashback rewards, instacash option, credit builder & investments, i couldn't be more pleased.

chyna,Money Lion is A great financial institution they have many different programs to help you with your credit and loansThe Insta cash is great for when you just need a little extra money
Nunya Business,It’s ok because you get to borrow the money. However you only can borrow 100 dollars at a time you can’t borrow the entire amount that is giving to you all at once.  Than they add their interest rate which is fine but than they ask for a tip. Wouldn’t you think the interest rate was to pay your employees..
BF,Great to have when you need fast and easy cash. The set up and adding you bank account or debit card to have the money transferred. There was no issue with the process.
Akeiba Manley,I don't like how it will kick me completely out of the app and have me re login when all I have to do is unlock my account with a print
karly,I love this app . When cash is needed it there without any problems.  Thanks moneylion!

I don't want to leave my bank!! For customers that continuously use the app and pay as they should up to $500 should be available.

C Gonzales,I am very great full for this app. Highly recommended and are the best.
shannon,Good for when I'm low on funds and need to get something done immediately. They have a bank account you can utilize or have it deposited to your norm bank. I use the card for shopping because I have round up for bitcoin. There is also cash back when you make purchases as well. The only confusing part is choosing to have the funds deposited. It takes some extra steps to turn off the instant pay or choose another account other than money lion. I like it and use it regularly
Dee,This is a pretty good app whenever your low on cash very easy in my opinion I'll give it a 5 star 🌟
Hannah,"User friendly. Quick in response, very helpful"

ej,"It’s a great way to get a small loan for things like gas or grocery food if you’re ever a little short on money. They also allow a good amount of time for you to get your paycheck in order to pay the amount. There is also 0% APR on paying back which is even better. Due to this, I am encourage to leave tips every now and then to help them!"
eliana,You guys suck...you claim to be a lender and when you need it the most you don't get it....I've had recurring direct deposit and positive spending history and u make me wait 60 days.

Tonya,"I downloaded MoneyLion needing some help with a little extra cash really quick, and they were able to loan me enough to give me the help I needed. I would recommend MoneyLion to anyone who is looking for a affordable loan until payday. MoneyLion also helps individuals improve and manage their finances and helps fix damaged credit scores also.

christy,This app is awesome. They always there when I need some extra help and it always come in time
melissa,I had a MoneyLion account for a year before I used it. Foolish. This is the best thing I could do for my finances. Thank you money lion - I highly recommend you. Several people said they were signing up but they never did it but I’m keeping after them. I know they’ll be happy once they do. I guess I’m not ready to improve their financial situation. Yet!
lindsay deputy,Money Lion is a very easy app to use with helpful information.  It's better than other pay apps
Fay,I love this app. Its great for borrowing money. I haven't had any problems.
deborah,"There when you need them most. Dependable, reliable, fast service."
cherise,"Customer service is the least helpful I’ve ever dealt with. They’ve made it beyond difficult to pay my small loan balance off. It’s almost like they don’t want to be paid? They continuously blame my other main bank as the problem, which isn’t the case because no other banking service besides MoneyLion seems to have an issue with my bank. This company is an absolute joke & any time I’ve called customer support, I end up more annoyed and stressed than I was prior to calling. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY FOR ANYTHING."
traciann,Been a very helpful and beneficial app. No regrets!
brittany,I love money lion but the only problem is whenever i dispute a transaction i never get a reply or my money back

alexis,"You recently changed being able to have money sent to my checking acct for free on instacash loan,, Now u only give money through debit card which charges 7.99 each time. By only allowing to take out increments of 100 dollars doing that 4 times is an extra 32 dollars. Not sure y this started happening.  But by doing that surely people will stop tipping since u r now charging too much in fees"
stephanie,Moneylion  is a very awesome app and am very pleased and happy with that. Great customer service and moneylion is always there for me when I need them. Thank you moneylion!
Anthony G,I think that the way the money comes out of your account should be able to be split up into multiple payments

joe,Great paydays advance help me out when I needed extra cash highly recommend.
pamela,"I have been using instant cash from money lion for almost 2 years. It really helped me out in 2020.It’s gone downhill. The app has convenient “unable to process” errors when requesting a new advance. Wouldn’t process. After multiple multiple times. I finally decided to try to leave an extra tip this time to see if it would make it work….It did. It processed as soon as I hit the $6 tip that continuously pops up. It didn’t have an error. Lo and behold the next time it popped up asking for a $6 tip, I declined it. Stopped working again. 🥴I guess this is just another greedy company now. The $8 instant transfer fee is more than enough of a tip. It doesn’t cost $8 to transfer $100 with any other banking platform (cashapp, chime.) It used to really help me out, now it’s just a headache. Bye money lion."
Jose Bustillo,Really will enjoy my birthday.. thanks for the advance.
deon,"Excellent App! Easily keep track of your credit, investing, credit cards, and bank accounts on one place! Also spots you up to 250 and let’s you repay on your terms 0% apr!"

Over a month and Still can’t link my Other account to career builder. I was able to link to the MoneyLion side but even then they stated they couldn’t verify my direct deposit. Result is 50-100 instacash and no builder funds. Talk is cheap, do what you say… say what you do.."

Wilhelmina,"Excellent service,  easy to navigate."
Donald Dixon,So helpful and you get cash instantly!!!!
Patty,"I reallly like MoneyLion.  It is easy to get a cash advance unlike some other apps.  The only thing i don't like is that they dont release my direct deposit as soon as they get it.  I still get paid two days early, which is great, but it could be three or four days if they released it once they received it.  But all in all I really like Moneylion."
Elisa Moon,So grateful for this app! Money Lion has helped me get out of some hard times. Thank you!

Lourdes Estrada ,Easy to set up Quick and fast to get extra money for  unexpected small expense that came up.
cori,Excellent! Thanks MoneyLion
coleman,"If I could give it zeros I would!! Moneyloin was an ""okay"" app till I began adding up all the fees. First, if you get approved for a 250 loan they will only allow you to cash out 100 at a time. The offers for delivery to your personal bank account holds a fee plus tip. Lets not forget about the interest for that hundred dollars you cash out. By the time you add all those fees the loan isn't worth it. I read a few complaints from the BBB about this company, and one of the advocates states that you don't have to tip and it won't effect you eligibility, but trying to cash it out matters so they lied about that, advocate also says that turbo for delivery is free and only takes a few hours for your money to arrive, well I went and tried to used this method, but it wasn't free, this service cost me 15 plus tips to have the money put direct deposit into my account, plus you add the interest which goes without saying, moneylion isn't honest and I also have screen shots to prove this, so once I pay this account off I will no longer deal with money lion"
dennis,Money Lion is awesome it's the best cash advance app out here..It gives you a decent amount at one time and the amount never drops or lowers on you like other apps as long as your income remains the same and you make your repayments..Your good to go..
Brenda Powell,Amazing. Fast. And HONEST.
Richard Mascarenas,It is quick and easy process for the Instacash.

Valen Rodriguez,Two Problem I HaveEverytime I Use Instant Cash They Want A Tip. When They Already Charge $5.99 On $100. I've Been With Them For Over A Year .Second Thing Is I Been With Them A Year .

BM,"I love the effectiveness about it, however, I don’t like to have to leave a tip with every withdrawal and pay to have it instantly placed in my account. It is already hard getting the loan to make ends meet but to ask for more money is not good to me. I would appreciate “if” I want to leave a tip, I would do so"

LaVarris,"Great app! Several different financial aids to assist your financial needs. The ability to borrow Instacash up to $250, if you qualify. The qualifications are clear and easy to understand.

It seems legit for the most part and I have come to trust this app. The people who comment negatively I'm sure are ones who dont pay thier bills or people who just always have something bad to say.
Beth Harper,Helps a lot when I need money on the spot
Jonathan Martinez,I called and asked for help with a situation and I got exactly what I needed. Very friendly and helpful. The employee didn’t judge. Is appreciated the respect and honesty from him.
Jasmine Anderson,Quit f*cki*g asking ten times per transaction for a tip. You charge a percentage interest on your loans.
colette,The service is good and very useful. Handy when needed.
anthony,They are the best!!
valeisa Crenshaw,"I absolutely love Moneylion! A ton of helpful options, professional support and guidance. I found it so much better than dealing with a typical Bank branch with hidden fees and other things, but not Moneylion! They've actually helped me start building my credit score back up, which I thought wasn't possible. I highly recommend Moneylion to anyone and everyone!"

Donna Uhlhorn,"Amazing customer service, fast transfers and a great selection of investment portfolios."
tucson,Money lion always comes through when I need it most
pete,The money is there when I need. But fees often change and they are aggressive about tipping. Very. Very. Aggressive. And usually just add it (like a good ten dollars ) to your total if you’re not careful about reading through everything. I’ve been caught once or twice like that. Even though they asked me twice before final review (and you answer no) they still add the tip anyway. Lol this feature I find annoying
Kay,Excellent to have. Very helpful
Arash,At 1st I was aggravated because without your card it can be difficult to do much but I love my moneylion account and instacash is convenient also. Thank you moneylion

nakeitha,Instant Cash comes in really handy when you need a little more money to pay a bill...
Casandra Hall,I don’t like the way they offer you one amount then a few days later it changes to a lower amount. Don’t really understand why when you’ve already had that amount before and paid it back but it changes the next month.
angela,asking for tips on top of the express fee is a little excessive
C Jackson,Get cash so fast and so easy. Love it
Monique Phillips,The EASIESTTTTTT WAY!!!! As soon as you cash out and payback is as soon as you can cash out again i don’t even care if that made sense but you get it 🤣

Moneylion use to be good when I first started using the app but has went down hill ever since. about ready to move on to another bank , and the so often notifications that I can use a boost on Instacash only to find out that it was a lie many many times."
rebecca,It went from getting $50 dollars back down to$25 even after I paid it off early

maria,Be able to use insta cash in bigger amounts - instead of 100 at a time - if you want 500 then get that instead of completing 5 separate times

Tyla Mcculla,"This service has really helped me in a bind more than once! My only complaint is that because you can only transfer up to $100 at a time, if you need more than that you have to do multiple transfers, which means multiple fees and multiple tips. It can add up quickly."
John,I love the app. It's more than just an application. It's a financial institution that helps with all your money management needs. And so much more. I tell everyone that they should use it. Been with them for about 3-4 years now and I have no complaints. They just get better. Thanks Money Lion🦁

I use both the credit builder and insta-cash features the credit builder i just started in November and its already showing on my credit with good payments.

That's why i still gave it 5 stars 😁"

robert brooks,"I have used Money lion for just over a year. It has worked, however, I added direct deposit and things got worse. I recieved an email that they were making changes to thier system, I was to get direct deposit that same week. I checked in the moring and the deposit was not in my account. I chatted with a customer service rep who was no halp at all. All the person would say was ""They do not detect a direct deposit to my account"". I checked with my employer, who put me in contact with their bank. I was told the deposit was transmitted and acknowledged by the recieving bank. I got back on chat with a service rep from Money Lion, was told the same thing, ""The do not detect a direct deposit to my account"". This went on all day with them, They told me some one would call me, this never happened. The direct deposit showed up after 4:00pm....Today, I tried to add my new bank to the wallet, the service to get a quick loan between paydays seemed like a good idea. Again, met with more problems... I added the account, it showed up in my wallet, but didn't show up on the roar money side. I again got on chat, they wanted me to give them my bank account number over text,  told them no, I had added it through the plaid system, then they wanted me to delete my app and check again. Seriously, they have the worse informed customer service I have ever used. I ended up canceling my account and service."
stephanie,Insta-cash helped me when I needed gas for work.  It's there for whatever your needs are.
Twin,"Great app, money management."
deann,"I'm leaving my feedback for a money lending app/Money Lion, that is user friendly for the most part. There are pros and cons, but if you need money to help you stay afloat until payday, this is the app for you! You are asked to give a ""tip"" for the lending services and charged a fee for instant same day transfer of money. It literally happens right away with this option. You can of course, do the option of 5 to 7 business days for no fee. If you decide that same day is a must, you could borrow up to 100.00 for 11.99. Your total amount of money to borrow could be much larger than the amount you're allowed to borrow at one time. You could be approved for up to $300 to borrow, but the app allows you to borrow $20.00 to $100 at a time. Giving a $4.00 ""tip"" and charging you a instacash fee of $7.99. Once ML is linked to your bank account, it can predetermine on your payday cycle that is reoccurring in history, when they could/can be repaid by you. It normally sets the repayment date for your next paycheck. If this doesn't work for you, you have the option of changing or moving this date around a little. It's never easy to borrow money, but it's a little easier when you are using an app that allows you to navigate what works best for you. Reminders and account information are on the app, it's not hard to use. The app can glitch sometimes and tell you that it's not connected to your bank account, but you can fix this easily. If you need money, give it a try..."

melanie,I love moneylion !!! It helps me in need and it's helped me get my credit up. After 4 or 5 months I decided to switch to them with my direct deposit and have no regrets
Austin Georgevich,This app is the real deal! #Teammoneylion All Day! More of the gracious lending apps and helps with credit building and finances too! Easy to use and worth it! #roarmoney 5 stars!
amber,MoneyLion is so easy to use. They give me a boost when I need it and I get cash back when I use my debit card. I also have a stock account that is easy to use and I can watch my money grow. Can't get any better than that.
kimberly,They are the best payday lender app around. Started at 40.00 and after 3 cycles I'm at 380.00.
Shane m,"After the whole debit card debacle ML has been treating me pretty well. I would recommend though, ML you need to work on your customer service over the phone. It leaves something to be desired. Other Than that, ML is great"
raymond,Awesome app i needed last minute advance and they helped me out with no issues.
malia,Applied for instacash advance and was approved very quickly thanks to having direct deposit from my job I definitely needed it right now
jennifer,I love how I can get a hold of them on the phone whenever I need them to their direct posit in their investment and their credit builder
Catherine Starks,It needs to be a little less money thirsty but they play by the rules they wrote and I respect that.Final Thought: They have yet to screw me over.
Brandon M,Money Lion is awesome. Never any issues or run around. NO hidden fees. Gives the option of getting advanced funds to get you by in-between pay periods. Also assist on investing. Great banking
laurie,"LOVE Money Lion!! So easy , so fast, never having to jump through unnecessary hoops and super easy to increase advance amount, whereas others take months to do . Definitely the best I’ve seen !!"
Sharon,"I've used this app 3 times now and so far it is great! Got me out of binds! Just remanded it IS a lending app, so payback is necessary to keep you on shape! Do not hesitate to tip, this is how it does not cost money like a lot of other loaning apps!"
holly,"I have to say, Moneylion has been the best thing to happen to me this year! The app is easy to navigate, you get a response in literally no time at all, and the customer service agents are amazing to deal with!! I'd give this app 10 stars if I could!! I'm a devoted fan of Moneylion now!! Thank you guys for rescuing me out of ruin!!"
Ash,Money lion is a good way to get money but the only thing I have a problem with is you have to leave a tip every time  Also be charged for instant pay.
Caz Johnny,"Get app, easy to use and helps me make ends meet"

The Cash Advances, the credit builder loan, and all the other promos they allow you are PHENOMENAL! This is the new way to bank!!"
dorren,"Awesome, easy to navigate"
alecia,I had some charge dispute issues that were never resolved.  Charges on my account that I didn't make! Other than that I have no problems with money lion.
jim ,"Terrible Terrible Terrible customer service! I requested $100 for instacash & it got sent to an account that I no longer even have. I contacted customer support cause that $100 was supposed to be for my childrens Christmas presents! All I got told was that there was nothing they can do. & now im going to be forced to pay back $100 that I NEVER even received. Moneylion is great! But their customer service really needs to be trained better to be professional, empathetic. These people are clearly in the wrong line of work*-Edited to add after getting a reply*Your customer advocate is the same exact way as your customer service"
chase,"Thanks for the help, I’ll always get you back since you got my back ."
Carlos Page,MoneyLion has helped me on more occasions than one. I highly recommend!!
C Scott,That’s a nice option to help the community 👏🏾👏🏾
ADsma,Money lion has been great. I have been very happy with how they help you when you need it and how they set up investing to make it easy.
Dawn,Customer service is horrible! It’s as if I’m talking to a child as many times I have to repeat myself and the fact I asked for confirmation of my account for my credit company and they told me they couldn’t send it with a letterhead because it’s for security purposes but they ended up sending me a regular email with my account information!!!! So much for security! Stupidity!
Alexis Goodwin,They are amazing with offering an instacash boost in between my checks!

You can go back in the app how ever many times you want up to the total amount of cash you can borrow!!!!! It's absolutely fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!
Nøø Cåp,You charge too much for the fees why is it so expensive???
Debra Samulevich,"Money Lion Bank is one of best for your personal banking, leaving your money for you growth. Brick and mortar banks overcharge fees and overdraft charges, which is never a problem with instacash. Financially, I only use it for emergencies, and I do not have overdraft or payday loans to placed me in a financial bind in the past."

NC,Service was great & fast
Chris,MoneyLion is a life saver. Don’t know what I would do without it!
therese,I think this has been a miserable experience for me during this holiday due to my account being hacked and funds have not been disbursed back to my account. There should have been some type of provisional credit offered to me in my time of need due to Money Lion allowing someone to get my information and fund $970 from my external account. It left me unable to shop for the holidays and caused much inconvenience and stress in my life. It has been approximately 6 days since my account was fraudulently taken advantage of and I haven’t received my funds back yet. Why does an investigation take this long to replace my money that was taken from my account?
Lisvet Villegas,Very reliable and it offers you boosts at any moment which is convenient
Julie LaFevre,I Love MoneyLionthe app fast and Convenient
Tony Smith,I'm so unbelievably absolutely satisfied with this app so far I'm glad to be accepted into the money lion company rewards benefits and more

william,"Helpful and greatful for this app, it has saved me more than you could agin"
Tory Dillard,The best! The only finance/loan app I need
jonathan,This instachash feature comes in handy when in a rut. I’ve used it twice now during the holiday season. I have one con regarding it and that’s the fees that come with it. I borrowed $50 and ended up paying 9.99 in transfer and processing fees.
Roberto Ortiz,It was good needed money quickly they came through
luis,If you need a quick loan then instacash through MoneyLion is the answer. Great service and fast cash into your account with many other partners to help with your additional needs.

Ben,This account has helped me so much with building credit to giving me a small payday loan when I needed it the most.
Anthony Jones,Appfunctions and links and financial guidance is above reproach..I am very pleased with an app and financial foundation
daisy,Always comes through when needed thank you guys so much
A. G.,"I like that you can request money in a pinch. The only super annoying thing is they make you split up the payments in small increments and ask for a tip on top of an instant transfer fee of $5+. I understand thats how they make money, but it hounds you for a regardless if you want to add a single tip for more than a single transaction/request. Not very flexible with dates is another thing. Moving a payment two days or so out isn't very helpful for people that, say want to move it out a couple of weeks, should something come up. Like I said, good in a pinch but if you can find another remedy, then that would probably be a better option."
shekitta,I love this app and bank you guys are amazing
Roslyn Mcdaniel,I have had a great experience using money lion it was very simple to use and is just a great service. Will definitely recommend to anyone that needs a little help.

heather,I love this company so glad I changed my employer deposit and the advances help me tremendously
sherry,This app has saved me in many situations whether it’s boosting my credit or teaching me how to invest or simply being there when I have no money!
kelli,Would give a 0 if I could. Took out a loan and right near the last payment the loan said new. Then the balance would get bigger and bigger. I would make a payment and they said I owed more. I went to pay loan off and the balance said -84. I contacted them via phone and was told it would be escalated to their tech team. Didn't hear back for 2 weeks. Called again and had to submit information all over again. Never heard back. Verified identity multiple times over email. Worst customer service ever.Update - called again after emailing and chatting and there has been ZERO changes. It has been nearly 8 weeks since I first contacted them.
Quincy Diggs,Fast Customer Service!
Gary Loan,Very easy to get instacash with great opportunities to increase or boost(as they call it) your available Advance limit. As well as increases for repayments made on time. And there's no restrictions on how long you have to wait after you receive your check or after you make a repayment to get another advance.
Allison Brianna,One of the most honest and helping websites that helps with short going
kip,Fast and easy to use and money available in seconds
Wyatt barnfield,It works fine. The tips are a bit ridiculous
frank,Money Lion has been so helpful to me in times of need! It's easy to use and they increase your amount when you pay your loan back! And you can borrow again as soon as the next day! I strongly suggest Money Lion!
Na,Easy to use and helpful
katie,"Roar money is great, easy to use and a good deal. I don’t understand what tipping is for. Who gets it? What did they do? It seems so automatic without human intervention. Instacash into a bank account is hard to use. You never know when funds will be deposited. It could take more than a week or less than two days. I stopped using it. On line chat is questionable. I had some hard to answer questions where the person I was chatting with said they would investigate and call me back. They never do. When I re-initiate a chat for the same issue there are no notes in the computer for the new person to see what the previous person did."
Tammy Langlie,I love Money Lion great banking system. And the insta cash is always helpful.
Amber Ritchie,"One stop shop for all financial needs basically, and compassionate and helpful is moneylion. Credit builderplus has helped raise my score considerably, as well as put some cash in my pocket. Instanced is great service if u ever need some extra security til payday. They have ur basic xryptos, super simple to buy and  sell. And anything the don't offer in the financial realm they'll hook u up with a lender they've partnered with! Thumbs up from me 👍"
william,I love using this service…you can pay borrow up to your approved amount and pay back before the due date..
shawn gray,An awesome thing it helps when you get in a bind
Tashina Patterson,Happy!! Always easy and fun to use.
Raena Salkey,I was low.on cash and they stepped up and showed out by helping me
melinda,this is a good app sometimes a little slow to load{could be my phone} but great they lend u money hundred at a time and gove u boost to get more instacash. so far overall best banking app ive used
Miss D,Thanks! Very easy to navigate and qualify
Jaclyn stumblingbear,I really ever use things like this and I'm very very money apps. I really do like this one.
ro,This is a great company to do business with never a hassle easy terms and cash advances check them out to will be pleased.
juan,Just when I needed it! Quick deposit! And what’s even better that it’s around the holidays!
taryn,"I’ve used MoneyLion for nearly a year and a half now and more in particular- have used the Instacash option at least a dozen times. I do not have a direct deposit into ML directly & I am still able to get up to $150 from ML. Just FYI though: when requesting Instacash, you can only do so in increments UP TO $50 at a time so I personally had 3 Instacash withdraws & not knowing how it worked, have a $5 tip with each request I took out & although the tip isn’t paid out then, at the end I paid out an extra $15 BUT THIS IS A FREE SERVICE so I do always try to tip a little something. Just a thought to the developers: Why not give the option for a custom tip amount because sometimes literally the lowest tip amount it will show all my screen is like five dollars and that may not be a lot to you folks who made this app, but for myself: a single mom to a wonderful, but also disabled child & who- especially right here at the holidays - is balling on a budget, a custom option for tipping I feel would help to generate more money being tipped. Just my two cents though! Love the app & thanks for saving my butt more than a time or two!!"
Meranda Ault,Very useful!
jimmy,Easy to signup and get started. Has plenty of benifits customer service was fast and helpful too.
Raiden Ricard,Is amazing right now giving me 90 bucks directly into my account which helps buy stuff for mi kids

Jose Nunez,Pretty good app. Insta-cash is nice.

Barb,"Not just another instacash app! They have helped me get a loan, build my credit and I earn money towards my investment account every time I use my debit card. Its a one stop for all my banking needs."
crystal,MoneyLion has saved me so many times I’m truly great full.
jamond,"I absolutely love MoneyLion. All the different option you get in one place. Credit building, stocks, advances, ect. It is everything I want in a mobile banking app!!!"

Tricia Kelley,So far it's been good to me...
Grace Buckner -Studvent,"Convienent for receiving fast Insta Cash, with on time payments and history, automatically it boost your amount, I like how I can pay and receive it back and receive it back instantly, without having to wait, when in small bind for cash. Love the service overall, will continue to use it. Also, I don't mind paying the fee plus giving tips, hey it helps us out."
Ashley ,"Best advance app I have ever used!! Quick, easy sign-up, works with varo bank and lots of apps do not, so I would definitely recommend this app."
Branden Scheer,"I occasionally used Instacash in this app. Someone in the company accessed my account, repaid loan 10 days early, took out more instacash for $575, signed me up for Plus Loan, and took out a $1000 loan in my name to be repaid 3 days later.  I contacted customer service day one of this fraud and my account was supposedly deactivated. I cannot access it now but someone is. I’ve left a voicemail for their specialized fraud team and instead of answering when I try calling them I get a message saying they already have a voicemail for this fraud so wait for their call. I’ve contacted my bank to dispute. So far they’ve tried to take $2875 from my checking account.  A week ago i would have told you what a great service this is but this nightmare isn’t worth it. I’ll never use them again."
Wade S.,Why would I pay so much extra for instant cash and then still have to wait days to get it? Don’t have instant and make people pay when it’s not what it says it is.
berthenia,I love it I just don't like the fact that u can only take a $100 at a time because the fee they charge you you get charged that fee every time you take a $100
John Vail,Your wonderfulvI do appreciate your business.
sandra,"I couldn't believe this was legit and literally gave me instant cash when I needed it! I highly recommend this site above all other ""money now"" sites."

Margaret Wells,They gave me 50 the first time so I was expecting more since y’all got the 50 back.. but it only let me get 25 after that
michael,"This is a good app to have when you have an emergency and need money fast. I was skeptical at first cause the first amount that I was approved was very low, but once I kept using it and repaying my balance back ON TIME my instacash went up drastically. I would highly recommend to friends and family."
jennifer,This bank service has paid me for using it and continues to provide incentives.
lauralee,"Love it, super easy and fast. Helped in a tight situation"
JDI,Very difficult to use. It said I took out money when I didn’t. Eaton app is way easier to use
E.V. Griggs,MoneyLion is really a life saver. I hate to use it because it is easy to get into a bad habit but when I really need it I have it and I am grateful.
MC,I love them. The InstaCash is my favorite thing when I’m in an emergency. I am usually able to get 200 if needed. It’s amazing and it’s always so helpful. 10/10 recommend!!
Aries,Good app and banking with instances was easier to get larger amounts without going back in.
jeff,Moneylion is great! Definitely comes in handy when you need or want a few dollars in between payday! Awesome app as well as opportunity!

jonathan,Love it! And it’s fun.
Skylar,Money lion has been a good experience. Although I had advanced to a higher limit for some reason they took it back. Even when I made my payments before Time and on time so I'm not sure how that works.
Ganja,Excellent service and help when you need it
QB,This service has been an absolute life saver for me as a single Mom . Thank you for all you do !!!
bryan,Always convenient and helpful when you need them.
Tyler Vaught,"Money Lion is great---not excellent-because it is fast money yet they don't have a notification for your instacash balance so you have to go out of your way to check that. However--You have the option of requesting a preset amount that's based on prior success with repayments. So---a word to the wise-make sure you can pay it back in the time frame that you choose so you can increase your ""credit limit"".  Overall---while they don't have a balance notification after you spend instacash you can select the day which you pay it back---while also having the option to adjust that date."
Melanie,Great app comes in handy
Phill,This is my second review of Money Lion.  They still provide excellent service and funding to suit my needs.  I rely on Money Lion for instant cash and they've always come through for me. I bet Money Lion will come roaring to the rescue for you too!
tony,Awesome app… came in handy
kristi,Easy to use and helpful for building your credit.
Antoine Dickens,What can I say about money lion well it’s awesome why you ask because if your ever short handed and need help they quick to approve you and give you up to $500 at once plus I needed help on my credit so I apply for the loan I got approved on the spot. Was awesome I’m paying up the loan little by little by my credit has gone up 20 pts so far that’s great . Best app of you don’t have it why not download right now !

robert,I expected more for what is advertised but overall it ok for what it is.
dee,I appreciate everything money lion does. They are amazing.
jay,MoneyLion comes in the clutch everytime...
customer,"I do not have a computer so I used the Money Lion APP to create an account, which was quick and easy. Once I logged into my account I was quickly able to use Instacash advance to have money deposited into my checking account. I liked other features of my Money Lion account so much that I got a RoarMoney, Investments, and Credit Builder Plus accounts. I enjoy reading the news selected for me when I open the Money Lion APP."
sterling,If I could give it a 0 I would . Worst company please if you like your money then don’t come here . All they will do is help you set up a direct deposit and then take all your money . Money lion left us with $0 dollars . And Christmas is around the corner . We have kids and we didn’t pull out ANY loans with them it was a direct deposit that never came in . Every time we call . They say call tomorrow . So please don’t choose money lion all they will do is leave you with $0 dollars right before holidays .
customer,I have been able to access money from the beginning and it's been an appreciated help! I even feel comfortable enough to try investing a little money without any knowledge in any of it.
mary,"I love this app!! Helped me out when I found myself in a jam. I don't normally submit reviews,( unless I'm sorely disappointed) but I had to give credit where it's due!! Moneylion is a real lifesaver!!"
letacia,Best self help app for financial freedom. It's been my go to for years now and I will continue to use the offers provided to us because Moneylion is secure and helpful. It's like a family member that provides options when we have no where else to go for support Thank you Money Lion🙏☯️💪👏✌️
Ashley,Nice to have someone who helps when needed ty
D.C.M,It was really easy to get an advance and get everything set up
User,Love this app!
heather,This app has it all! It's easy to use and does everything from bank accounts to loans. They're also set up to help you invest and buy bitcoins if you'd like. All around solid company!
Dispointed,Needed some quick cash to tide me over till payday. It was a quick and simple process. Money was in my account instantly.
devon,Excellent service.Extremely satisfied.
anne vega,"The application is great with the many tips, features, and a world of things that one can use towards one's financial endeavors.On another note, when a loan is paid in full, it takes quite sometime to show that it has been paid in full.Another feature that should be taken into account is that of the tipping part when taking the Instacash feature is the customizing of the tips and should be part, an ideal part of the Instacash."
Pretty,I actually love this app this app is so honest they will let you borrow as long as you repay you don't have to wait months and months to borrow again so say for instance if you need to borrow $300 and you already borrowed $300 once you pay that $300 back you able to you able to borrow $300 again I like that because it also give you financial stability where you never know what's going to come up you may need to pay a light bill cell phone bill get new tires oil change all that plays in part in this program it allows you to be able to do that while you wait for payday to come
jennifer,Best way to get out of financial problems in minutes
Jordan Hebert,Instant cash help builds your credit thanks for the cash
pacov2,I have only experienced one issue will some money missing out of my account other then that I recommend money lion to all my family and friends.
Angie Hartness,"Easy, safe and fast!"
Andrew Perry,A lot of useful products. Quick and easy to use app.
John Jairo,Very dependable when you need that extra little boost between pay periods without having to ask friends or family.
christopher,I was approved a certain about for insta-cash. I used and paid it back. I was told that I would be given the same amount in the future if I need it. But the next time I was given a much smaller amount. I also have problems with the App from time to time.
jared Anderson,Got a 250 advance and it was perfect timing
Chanta Taylor,👍👍👍😍😍😍👍👍👍
Curph,This is a great app to use if you need some money fast
hr,I have enjoyed using the Money Lion app. It's great for getting through the next payday. I recommend it!
Ashlei,"It worked very easily, so far"
amy,This is a good app so far. I like they have a credit builder but I wish I didn't have to pay 20 bucks a month on top of almost 50 a week for the credit builder loan. Also I wish that the instacash had longer time to pay off for people who are looking for mid short term. Customer service for calls are excellent. They take the time to help you. UPDATE- after being on the app for a bit it's pretty great. Still just iffy about paying membership fee for credit builder and instacash is great but you get a few weeks to pay it off. With the credit builder I only seen about 20 to 30 point increase. I have already deactivated my account because I don't use it often. But thanks for the memories
Gina,"There are many useful services provided by Moneylion, as well as providing useful information to help save, earn, borrow, and spend responsibly. I would recommend Moneylion, especially to those who need a little extra cash in a hurry because Moneylion makes it possible for anyone to borrow until payday, even with not so good credit!"

jana,I am honored to be a Moneylion member..they have my hack..when I needed them...you can invest a little at a time and watch it grow.. The have Instant cash when you need a few dollars and over time it will increase over time. Moneylion also have other great things..just download the app and enjoy the ride.
custome,Best finical app hands down. I use it to get instacash which helps a lot in a tough time. Also I was approved for a $500 loan which helps me build my credit. I been using MoneyLion for over a year now and I’m very satisfied I recommends it to all my friends and family members.

brodrick,This app helped me with some tough times!!
monica,"Money lion is definitely a helpful app/organization. They even lend you money in case of emergency! What sucks is that every time u use your card, it charges you 2 dollars so your best bet is to just pull the max amount until you're satisfied. And when purchasing online, make one big transaction instead of a gang of small ones, because it gets to adding up after 5. Much less 10+. Over all in pleased with the benefits of this app and they definitely outweigh the downsides of it."
Cynthia,Easy to use and pretty straightforward app along with good customer service.
emile,"I enjoy money lion,it really does help me out since I get paid bi-weekly it’s like getting a percentage of my check in the middle of a pay period. But I don’t like the fact that they offer me 260$ then only give me 220? I’m still confused on how my loan offer changes. But I’m all I’m very please with the payback and the 0%apr. it really does help when needed"

Joshua Crowder cowdough,Great customer service always there when in need
austyn,"This company is absolutely horrible. I signed up for instacash and to get paid a day early but for the past 2 months I have had to call them about my check not being deposited one day early, as advertised, they proceeded to say that they don’t see it or they do see it and it has been deposited but it’s not showing on my end. I’m just tired of the headache. Another issue is that you have to fill out an actual form if there has been theft on your account. I had an ATM not dispense $60 I needed and I called customer and they told me to send the form and it would take 2-3 weeks for them to review and possibly give a credit but nothing that could be done in real time. It’s real unfortunate because I needed that montane it wasn’t my fault it was lost."
JENNIFER,Money Lion is a great app.  It functions very well and as intended from what I understand.

Quincy Jackson,Money lion is always there when I need it. Thank you
Danny King Johnson,I like moneylion thay should help ppl like myself get first time loans. And right now i think thay are taking 39 or 49 bucks a month for a credit builders. Loan but ive not seen nothing and dont even know. Why im paying it.... Was hoping thay would explain why thay were taking tha money but i get tried of getting new cards bc some one taking funds that ant suppose to be so.
Timothy Gilpin,"I really only use this app for the instacash feature, which does work and can be helpful..but it’s misleading to say it’s interest free! The amount of money they will loan to you can only be requested in arbitrary increments. Example: when I have $300 available to borrow, I have to make 3 request in rapid succession because I’m only allowed to ask for $100 at a time (even though I can borrow $300 at a time [confusing right!] and There’s a percentage based fee on the transaction itself if you want it to happen instantly (which is almost always), so when I need $300 I will be charged $30 on top of the $300 in transaction fees; The app is very pushy with asking for a tips during the transaction and upon using the feature again later, it will remind you that you didn’t tip last time and ask for the tip AGAIN for that transaction before proceeding to the new request. Also when I stopped tipping regularly,  they changed my requestable amount to lower amounts, so that I had to make more request to get the same amount of money (therefore netting more fees for the same amount of money) they also jumbled up the request amounts in attempts to throw you off so you can accidentally select the wrong amount and (you guessed it) need to make even more request for more fee. If you fall for their design you will be paying ~25% interest on these transaction…..that being said borrow carefully and read all the prompts. It has been a helpful tool since I figure out their traps, but honestly dangerous if you don’t catch it at first"
Ronnie Owens,My account was hacked 3 days ago and no one will communicate with me.
porche,"The first loan I received quickly with no hassle; however, the second for $75 has still yet to be deposited into my Roar account. I better not have to pay that back since I haven’t received it and keep being told there’s an error on yall end which y’all have yet to fix!"

kai,Amazing how they try and help when u need it
calvin,Love this app the loans the Instacash awesome.
dana,"My lion they account has been great. I have actually switched over my direct deposited and for what it’s worth the two days early pay is excellent as well as the ability to use Insta cash. I never have to worry about the repayment because it comes out at its respective date and there’s no interest or additional fees except for the transfer fee if you use the turbo and that’s pretty cool. I also get the chance to invest which I do and now with the cryptocurrency add-on, the investment is even better."

filomena,"This is a great service to have. The only problem I have is, after I linked my bank account to access instacash, it only shows two of my recent direct deposits. It also shows whereI moved money from spending account to my credit account as a payment. When I first linked my bank account, it said I had $300 available for instacash, then it changed to $25 only. I don't understand how it why this changed. Everything else has been good so far."

sarah,I love your app and the whole banking experience with you but it is annoying when you get an email about an instacash boost or something and the link in the email doesn't work. Especially when it doesn't give you any kind of error message or therefore-a reason why it isn't working.
Beto,When money us needed in a pinch  and all resources have been used up.go to moneylion they arena lifesaver.great website with information you can use to get out if debt and raise your credit score

cody,Outrageous interest amounts and pay attention when you borrow or they will trick you in to a 10 dollar tip on top of interest rates there is also a class action lawsuit against this company they are a prey on low income people beware of this company does nothing for your credit score.
jess,I’ve had my MoneyLion account for a few years and it’s been the best experience. Never had any crazy fees or extra charges like traditional banks. Never had any reason to contact customer service.
Marcos,Easy access to emergency funds at a reasonable rate.
Nancy Ryan,Excellent.  Easy to use Very convenient.
Brianna,Watch out they place you account under review and lock you out of your funds with no explanation just for paying your rent. All of my bills that are scheduled to come out will bounce and I will get late fees added which MoneyLion is not going to pay. I’ve been with them for years n this is how they treat their customers. I can’t even use my card to get gas for work…. So once I get my money I’m switching accounts and leaving this crooked place.
customer,I have been using this app for a while and has been very helpful and convenient when I need a little extra cash simple to use and very fair
christopher,Good apt to use if you in a bind and need quick cash

christine,No interest loans helped me make up my bills when I didn’t have the money
sean,MoneyLion has helped me a lot the past few months especially with the holidays being around the corner. They don’t penalize you if you are running behind on payments
joy,"i would give a 5 star as its quick and easy service, the only thing I don't like is there's a limit per request, id leave a bigger tip if you could request up to your limit at once, its not fair that if you want to request all of your instacash you have a fee per request"
tina,"My account has been compromised  I had three transactions tht I didn't authorize myself.  I thought this site was safe to keep my bank info private an secure from others getting into it, but I was wrong"
Kim,money loin us anmjhgdfkigddchujnfrjrb
DeAndrea Hammonds,Very great  helped me a lot  I really appreciate it

Letroi Thompson,It have been a great experience
ReeveZMum,Great for emergencies!I give money lion 5 stars for excellent service.
Sheryl Bruce,"All is well now Kayla took care of everything, she even followed up with me today!"
sara,"I am a truck driver and took a load from Virginia to Florida. Then from Florida to Atlanta, GA and from there back to Virginia. I found out that my account hacked by someone in Houston TX by calling the stores that my account had been hacked based on my bank statement. Anyway, once I got home to try to get an Uber home my account was declined. This happened in a span of less then 24 hours and when I reported it to Moneylion and gave them the details they absolutely refused to insure my money and place it back into my account. Its December and Ive been fighting to get my funds placed back into my account since the 24th of July. Long story short, from my experience Moneylion does NOT insure your money even though they claim to be covered by the FCC, which will be next phone call. Again your money is not insured with this institution and you will have to  QUALIFY to get your money back and beleive you me, they have zero intention on making sure your money is safe or returning it back to you if there is fraudulent activity on your account. YOU may as well be the suspect as far as they are concerned. Please DO NOT put your money or trust your finances with Moneylion. Its one of those places where its all good until it isnt good. And when its bad, its BAD! Ive had issues catching up on bills ever since and again, STILL fighting for basically my whole paycheck. You wont receive any help filing so good luck with that. They may call back but it will look like a spam call, and good luck getting hold of someone that takes your money and your account seriously unless you need to pay them. I cant give up because I cant afford to but I pray this review is taken very seriously to whom ever views it and please please please protect your money. Its too hard to earn to leave it in an unreliable intitution such as Moneylion. As for Moneylion please dont respond to this review, just work on getting my money back to my account because nothing you can say in response to this post to undo the negative effect that your lack of ethics has imposed on my family. I only ask for my funds and to peacefully part ways. Anything outside of that will be received as disingenuous at best."

tamica,Very good UX and a very helpful/convenient tool for life.
KB,Moneylion truly  has the best banking policies I’ve seen. Best place to repair credit and if need be there is roar money to borrow.
heather,I have been using instacash for a long time and it always helps me when I’m in a bind.
Victor,Always very helpful and user friendly  I an on moving my direct deposit once i can

david brown,"The best App ever, help me when I needed more!! Thank you guys you are awesome!!!!"
Terekia,"I absolutely love this app. They are true to their word as far as what they offer. Their services are very simple to use and the results are fast!!! This app has helped save me from going negative this month, while waiting on payday. I do not use these apps often only in hard times. I have to say so far this one is my favorite."
Kristy Carroll,"I requested a credit builder loan. I started my premium membership in order to do so. I paid a fee in order to get the loan immediately. The loan amount did not come immediately. 2 days later, when the loan amount still had not been deposited, I called customer service. I was told by the first person it was a latency problem and not to worry because people were already working on fixing it, but she had no clue how long it would be. I asked to talk to a supervisor. He told me it was not a latency problem. He submitted an escalation supposedly for the correct department to initiate the deposit right away and it would be done within the next 24 hours and that someone would email me by the end of the day to confirm. I got no email that day. And it’s been 3 days since that call, and I still don’t have my loan. If it wasn’t the weekend, I’d have called back by now though I do y expect anyone to actually know what’s going on or help in any way."
marquita,Awesome app  Easy instacash
Nathaniel Franklin,I would recommend anyone to use money lion... Customer service is great and it's helped me out with getting my credit repaired with the credit builder loan they offer.

Alma Fletcher,The most positive thing about this account is your instacash advances
jordan,I have been going through a lot with my cancer and felt like I wasn't going to get my medicine or never be able to get my money back in order.I signed up on your app and it has been amazing.With your loans I'm able to get my medicine and also not have to work so hardMy credit score is also increasing I am so very happy with everything y'all have done for me.
Shannon Crumbley,Always is with you no matter where life turns and takes you. Through it all moneylion is with you
Richie Carroll,It is great that the instscash limit goes up over repayment and time yet I am curious as to what the limit is for those without direct deposit as it states in the beginning that you unlock full access to $250 after the 3rd successful repayment plans. I understand that you can’t just unlock that much money if someone were to just get on and get money and pay it back 3 times in such a short time frame. Overall I would recommend them to anyone that I know.
tim stein,My experience with this company has been nothing but awesome they're always there when I need them any problems at all I like this company to anyone that is in need have a quick loan
tavara phillips,The experience with Money Lion was easy and you receive your cash fast. Out of all the lending company this one is the best.
Lette,I have received some of my money back. But the Fraudulent charges are still happening. One today for 254. Dollars
stephen,Had an account previously and it was easy to come back to them. No hassles.
vanessa,So for its been everything it says I trust it more than my chase bank
ebony,"I don’t normally write reviews but this app is just too good not to. The Instacash feature is lifesaver to be honest. It helps me pay rent, bills, groceries, etc. when my paycheck isn’t up to par LMAO. It’s helped me to learn how to manage my money better. I really recommend setting up a Roar Money account too it’s super easy and is just like a regular debit card."
Robin,"MoneyLion's InstaCash has been a life saver more than once for me! It's such an amazing, and beneficial feature they offer. Not to mention their customer service team has always been there to help with there were any issues I had."
Salvian Barnes,I have used the 25 dollar advance twice now and I have to say it came at the perfect time and I am surprised that it actually works like it says I'm always doubtful at these apps but it's legit
Elizabeth Weinacht,"Unlike predatory payday loans, MoneyLion won't destroy your life for needing help. As long as you pay back what you owe, they always come through."
Rachel Owens,Terrible customer service and the instacash limits fluctuate. I had a small bonus check I received from my employer days after my original direct deposit and my limit was decreased horribly
angela,I just don’t understand how this company works. I continue to get emails about getting 25.00. I also do not how to transfer without a fee.
Jonathan martinez,Quick n easy. Comes in handy when u r in a pinch
naquan,There freaking awesome good credit or bad credit there the best
latisha,Thank you for everything you are the best
Rudy “ReauxTheGodd” Bee,"I love this app. Helps me out majorly. But I only gave it 3 stars because it cost so much to get it sent to u fast and u can't ask for the full boost at once. And sometimes the due date is sooner, or further away but never consistent.  But thanks for being there for ppl who need a little extra help."
Colin G.,I love the fact that it helps boost your credit and it allows you to get a loan as well as pay day loans but as far as the pay day loan it should give you a expiration date. So that way we can know if we have bills coming up it will let us pull back out the same amount I was able to pull out $560 as a pay day loan after I paid it back it dropped to 315 and I was on hold for over a half hour because I had rent due and couldn’t get the rest of the money in time
mike,Such an amazing and helpful app when I need it 100/100 recommend!! 🤩
brandon cleveland,"I can only put it in a few words this is awesome, this is a wonderful program to help people with money. All people ask for is a chance. That chance is to do better for their families. As long as they keep there word and communicate about their bills that they owe you all. This is wonderful"
sinwoo,"MoneyLion has been a fantastic company to work with. The website is very easy to navigate and is self explanatory. The also offer many other options, such as loans, rewards and helping with money management. Thank you MoneyLion for offering such a great service."
pbm,They definitely deserve 5+ stars. Getting the money took less than 5 minutes to apply for and get approved. Thank you MoneyLion. Yu really helped me out. 😁
Abraham Braunstein,You guys are charging me over 400$ when I only took 200 I called customer service about the issue and it still has not been resolved. It was verified with my bank via conference call that I only took 200 of instacash yet it still has not been corrected. I can send in screen shots and everything but still the app is saying I took 400 until this is corrected I am very unsatisfied. They said they would reach out to me within 3 days yet still no call. Feel free to call me to discuss the issue 7173146776

Shel Alderson,Very easy to navigate and have had nothing but great experiences from them. My payback date fell on a holiday and they worked with me so my account didn't overdraft. I think they are amazing and so glad they have been able to help me in a jam. Five thumbs 👍 if I had them. Love it

brett,"MoneyLion is grrreat... Especially if you're like Tony the Tiger promoting Frosted Flakes ""They're Grrreat"""
matthew,The only thing I don't like is you have to pay multiple fees to take out your instacash.. there's no option to take it all out at once.
Hab,It was excellent
Tracy Smith,Money Lion is AWESOMENESS! Ever since the day I joined there is no looking back and I’m going to spread the good news to family and friends and I have many!

April,They're great.  Spotted me $250 right away . I love moneylion
sharon,I have been with Money Lion for over 2 years. I have been able to invest and manage my investments with ease. There is also the credit builder loan that I have taken advantage of multiple times and the biweekly payments are small and manageable. There is also the cash advance program which has also been very helpful and I have taken advantage of it frequently. My only complaint is that I have had a direct deposit from day 1 and yet it tells me that it is not detected. Which in turn changes my cash advance amount available. Other than that it is very beneficial and helpful. I get my credit score right on screen and I can see where my money goes and get paid two days earlier than regular checking/savings accounts. I recommend you to many others who have the same circumstances and situations that I have because I know it will help. Thank you Money Lion! Christina LevensonWyoming 😊
Kristopher,Always there when needed and always quick to lend
devynn,Been a customer for a while very easy to use they're awesome would recommend to anyone
Jessica Michelle Pope,I just love Moneylion! The thing that resonates with me the most is applying for money from Instacash after my debt is paid. I can pay off my bills on a timely basis. Thanks for your services.

teresa,quick and easy. works about like earnin except you get the money immediately.
david,It’s great. Helped me out when no one else would. Thank you
corinthians,Used to be 5 starts but now you need to request the money and THEN transfer it to your card or account. So instead of getting the money instantly it takes 2-5 business days.
adreion,I use this app quite often. It has helped me afford last minute things like cat food and gas money when I'm stretched thin. Their fees are fair in my opinion and I've never had any problems with payback dates. Highly recommend!

dc,Giving me loans even when I didn't expect it. Thank you Money Lion!
fred,Great app. Fast instacash
Vanessa Hale,Money lion is good to get money fast and the sign up process was easy.  The fees are extremely high and you are forced to request $100 or less at one time and the fees are the same no matter the amount $5 or $50.  The app can also trick you into paying them an additional tip ($10) if you don’t pay attention. Overall good app to get the money you need fast but you will pay 💰 way more than your typical pay day loan establishment
jacob,I am grateful they are there to help!
joseph,Money Lion has always been there for me when I need the extra cash for what ever may pop up! Not only that but Money Lion helps me invest in what I like. Money Lion Hoohaah!

Carlos Rodriguez,"Very good experience using MoneyLion,get my advance without any problem every time I need,and quickly"
Mrs A.Summers,There customer service reps are barely literate and have absolutely no people skills! Fire everyone and start over.
MS,Honestly a pretty awful banking experience. I opened a RoarMoney account about 10 days ago and am having all sorts of issues.  My husband has tried 2x to send me money and both times it’s been rejected.  I tried setting up a Zelle account to facilitate this and I keeps getting rejected. In addition to this I cannot Venmo anyone through this account - the transfers keep getting declined.  I called customer service and the woman I spoke to was absolutely useless.  She told me she would “escalate my issue” and have someone get back to me - that was 4 days ago.  It seems the only way this account works is through ApplePay.  I plan to deplete my funds through ApplePay and then close my account.
paul williams,5 Stars I highly recommend!!

nikki,Great way to save and earn and get extra cash I love it

The fees are reasonable and they acknowledge a good standing client. I am very sick and my new health condition happened suddenly and it's really turned our world upside down. But thanks to MoneyLion, I've been able to get money instantly before my pay arrives. Check them out! I believe you will be just happy with them as I am."

Jessica Donaho,"Simple, quick and efficient. No hoops to jump through, money is automatically deposit in your account. Couldn't ask for more."
Jennifer Day Kennedy,"My account was hacked and several hundred dollars were taken from me via cash advance and the repayment was talken from my checking account. The money taken was linked to a Moneylion roar account I've never used, never gotten a card for and  they took out an advance of over $500. I contacted customer service and they said they do an investigation. Several weeks later they got back to me and found there to be no fraud.... I live in NC and the person that did this spend several hundred in an Apple store in Boston. Moneylion closed the investigation and never responded despite the numerous times I've reached out to them. They owe me the money that they took from my account from a clear case of fraud. The are absolute crooks!"

Pam,"Great and fast service,Right on time"
Jo,"MoneyLion is amazing!  The suite of financial tools available is amazing. If you have an income and find youre short and need some emergency cash, they got you- And MORE IMPRESSIVE(SHOCKING ACTUALLY), is the ability to borrow that cash, INTEREST FREE( i think up to $1000-based on your income and other factors most ive borrowed was around $400)!  They use Plaid, so you can easily integrate your accounts from other banks, they have very good customer support, even on Sundays!  Some services cost a lottle bit but they give you ways to earn that back just by using your MoneyLion debit card!  The App is also actually really useful, and easy to navigate.  MoneyLion is a real competitor to ANY 'BIG BANK' brand, and I can say, beats most.  Honestly, im seriously impressed.  This has been MY experience.  You definately should check them out! -RYAN"

jess hall,"Over all I cant genuinely complain about anything inparticular. There's room for improvement especually with the customer AI interface. The only true complaint I can see is within the retentions department. Having to resend the same documents already sent and repeating steps already requested is especially burdensome and costly to the client if its not resolved within a short window. I myself suffered late fees totaling around $125 and a small high interest loan just to put food on my table for my son's.  But with there being a holiday it wouldn't be fair to say it's always this way. Room for improvement. The apps start up is cumbersum and crowded. Those using older model phone's will find it crashing a lot before being able to access their information.  Report bugs, such as the apps refusal to acknowledge my need for a new card due to its own malfunction should be clearly visible so they can be sent by the user and addresses asap. Those receiving direct deposits due to benefits or social security should be recognized and not bombarded with continued adds requesting they start one theyve already established. Warnings about policy issues should be given before any attempts be made to lock a customer from their funds instead of surprising the customer and denying them access. Especually with a 5 day wait period."
Connie Sue Immel,"I have been a customer of Chime‘s for years. I wanted to find an online bank that offered a bit more. I saw an ad for MoneyLion so I signed up through the app and got my card. Once I got into the app I saw so much stuff that Chime did not offer. I love the fact that you offer different ways for people to save money. I can invest in crypto, I can invest in the stock market, I can choose where my spare change goes when I want to safe or something. I love the Insta cash. The credit builder is absolutely my favorite though. I was with you for a month and I got approved for a credit card which I’ve never been able to do my whole life. I appreciate that I’m able to build my credit up through your app. I will be a lifelong customer if you keep it up!"
candice,10/10 would recommend to anyone always there when I’m in a tight spot
John,It was good  and I liked it

Tricia Brewer,It is easy to use and has really helped me when I needed it
tosha,Its good for the extra cash but why charge a fee and ask for a tip.
arkeria,I have sent numerous requests about why I can't login and have not heard anything
Christopher Croute,I love this app! It helps out so much between paychecks to be able to advance more than just $50. They transfer my advances instantly -even to a different bank account if need be!

Michelle Hammons,Money Lion’s Instacash is a wonderful tool if you need quick cash. Be sure to open a Roar Money account for immediate access to Instacash! Money Lion has an investment service that is on point also. Fees could be a little less for access to your money but everyone has to make a living. Five stars!
rebecca,"I have enjoyed using money lion so far.  I've watched it go from just an app to borrow money from, and am now using many of the services this app offers.  It helps knowing that when I tip, that that money is going towards something more for the customer.  I await to see what the money lion ride brings in next."

alexis,"During the recent Thanksgiving weekend I noticed a lot of fraudulent transactions on my account and thus has began my Nightmare with MoneyLion.1. Moneylions banking website is useless. You cannot access transactions or bank statements from their website. The only way you can do banking is via the App. You can only use the app to view your transactions or bank statements. The website is useless. How can you call it online banking if you are not able to review your transactions online. 2. The fraudulent transactions need to post for the bank to take action, however in my experience these transactions are in process status for ever with all of my balance deducted / hold because of this fraud. I contacted the bank for help since it's been like a month and my money is stuck the bank is asking me to contact these merchants and ask them to send Money Lion an email to remove the hold3. Customer Service Sucks, they don't know their how their own products or services work.I'm waiting for this issue to be resolved so I can go back to my other Major banks such as Bank of America who's first action on fraud is to give you your refund and then investigate, however Moneylion s policies look different, you got to print and sign a form and send it back with in 10 days, you don't hear back from them, then they say they didn't get the form. trust me it's been a night mare I have also sent several emails Requested to speak to someone in the corporate office. Requested for a call back from someone in the US but to no avail.I hope I get back my money that were fraudulent transactions. I'm gonna say good bye to these folks once I do that"

Kbeavs,I love money lion it is a great service to use for emergencies.
Darren ,"I started using money lion after reading a few reviews. I now can borrow up to almost 1000$ monthly. I have a crypto account. I have a $1000 credit building loan with them. And, also an investment account. They have been very fair in any fees. I honestly cannot say enough good about them. However, you will probably start slowly able to get 3 to 400$ loans. Etc. Once you have done buisness a while they are awesome."
Malika CC,"simple, user friendly, straight forward"
Lionel Poole,Love the services and the instacash is always useful.
Bennie Wiley,Money lion has been a true God send and I really appreciate you all from the bottom of my heart
Carlos,This app is absolutely amazing. It's super easy to use and the company is so revolutionary. I love knowing I can count on an app to give me time to pay money back at a great time frame and the increasingly cash limit is outstanding and different from others. Superb!
christina,"I had a friend rave about how they could get money right away with MoneyLion. So I signed up. My limit was less than $200 but that was fine. Once I decided to use it I was only able to borrow $50 at a time. Then to get it you either have to send it to RoarMoney which is free but then you have to pay to get it to your bank unless you want to wait a few days. If you skip RoarMoney and want it to go directly to your bank there is a fee, or your debit card a fee. However you get your money, unless you have changed your banking to Money Lion and you have direct deposit set up and a debit card with them, they charge outrageous fees to get your money. And since you can only get so much at a time, you pay the fees each time. It adds up. I have been with my bank for 20 years and I am not going to change it to bank with a mobile app. It is a good service if you do not mind all the fees."
Lisa Wilkins,Very helpful when you need them!
B Roman,"Great company and great process, but some of the extra fees come from getting instant cash. Knowing most people if there even doing this they want there money at that moment."
rashida,I had 5200 in fraudulent transactions and it is taking over a week and no one has acknowledged or addressed the case.   I asked for a supervisor to call twice and no one has called.   To try and talk to the special handling team you sit on hold for 2.5 hours before someone answers.  I need my money refunded ASAP!
amber,"Overall I really like MoneyLion but definitely has some issues.Non existent customer service, issues linking bank accounts and basically false advertising for “Instacash” that is far from “free”"
ya,This is one of the easiest apps that I have ever used to borrow money and to help with my credit.
nichole,Thank You very much I truly have to get cash

DK,I've learned so much from Moneylion! Easy to navigate app and the insta cash is amazing. I'm still learning about the other programs they have but so far I've found they have outstanding customer service and everything was explained in detail so no questions were left unanswered.
monica,I’ve been using Money Lion as an alternative to traditional banking since they’ve began. No regrets. Always great service and incentives and even improvement in credit score. Also all investments in one spot including bitcoin
brittany,"Still waiting on my issue to be resolved where you owe me 100$ and I’ve submitted proof but all I get in response is you have a dedicated team working on, for almost a month now."
Travis White,MoneyLion digital app came in handy toward the pay process. Very Classy design did the trick I was able to get a reoccurring loan per month of 1000. Good job banker lol
Kayla Wiltcher ,I love money lion. Its so quick and easy
james,Get app great company there when you need them
Staci Harrison,I needed $25 to pay for some gas to give me to work for the rest of the week until I get paid and money lion help me with that. I'm a man of karma and I believe good things will come to those who do good things for other people so I am spreading the word at my job which happens to be a major casino in Las Vegas and I have already gotten six coworkers to sign up same day. I wish you guys the best of luck in your ventures and Hope for much success.
"Me, You and Nipsey T","So far My experience with my MoneyLion Banking Account has been pretty awesome. The Shake-n- bank rewards program is unlike anything I've ever seen, after every purchase you shake your phone(like spin the wheel) for a chance to receive up to 100% of what you spent, so far the largest was a $2.25 reward for paying my electric bill. Then there's the InstaCash advance which is pretty great too. The good part about is it sets a limit on the amount you can get base on income AND SPENDING HABITS, this way they know you able to safely repay it. Also if you can wait 2 days there is no fee (but they do ask for a tip). If you do need it instant then there's s flat $5.99 fee not too high but still a little. But ALL-N-ALL I think is a great banking app."

jacqueline,A mass amount of helpful as well as useful features. Many benefits of being a member. They will spot you the cash you need with no fees for the loan. Moneylion will also help with a credit builder loan and has partners for higher amount loans. Shake and bank feature is another way they help your finances bringing yet more money _(free money-surprise amounts) Btw this is my personal feelings and the 5 star review is coming from being a happy moneylion customer that I am willfully saying without getting paid for my reviewJust sign up already! You know you want to!

Nykia,I absolutely love money lion! Very easy to use!
Audrey Spencer,MoneyLion is great. It’s always right on time when you need them. They are the ones you can depend upon. You can’t go wrong with MoneyLion.
adam,💰 🦁  Is a pretty decent service. I'm satisfied most days with their services...the only drawback is that when there IS an issue- its difficult to get in touch with their customer service dept to speak with an actual person- and get satisfactory assistance. I'm still waiting on $100 that's floating around in limbo and all they can tell me is to wait 3-5 business days.....
Lindsey  Carter,"Easy to use, convenient"
Andrew,"I do not recommend this company. Currently it has been 8 business days - almost 2 weeks that my account has been closed by their error due to my direct deposit from my job triggering the account to be closed. I have over $3000 frozen in the account, have been able to pay rent and was unable to pay for our thanksgiving meal. My experience with them has been awful. I’ve called 5 times and emailed 3 providing all information they have asked for with no new information. I was my account would be open in 1-2 business days after sending in verification information.  Ive heard no updates.  Their retention team is not responsive and you will be left vulnerable. Their direct deposit does not enable you to get your check 2 days early. That’s a lie and it’s never happened. Please save yourself and do not use their direct deposit and do not use this as your main debit card. You could get stuck like me. They are good for getting you out of a bind with the roar money loans but not have me in a terrible bind financially. I’m posting this everywhere hoping I will finally get an update. For those in the same boat, I encourage you do the same."
daniel,Love moneylion! Get paid early and the instacash really helps if I need it! Had my account over two years now
LS,So far I can't complain this bank has improved my credit score over 60 points in less than 3 mouths an is amazing with services an i am extremely happy

Rich,"Helpful when you need a little extra cash to hold you over.Question: states you give 10-20% of pay. Only once was allowed 880.00, Since I stay at 820.00. I have Money roar, Credit Builder, and the advance account. All in good standing. Why am I not offered 1000."
christopher,"I've been using Money Lion for a while now and they're always there to keep you and your finances in order, there's so many options for you to choose from depending on your personal situation. Not to mention up to $1,000 with direct deposit and instacash which can most definitely help you when you're in a pinch."
Amanda,It was very fast and efficient. I would recommend it to anyone.
Sarah Biggers,"EXCELLENT APP! Super easy to use, cash advance is great, easy to invest, and easy to move money from one bank to MoneyLion and visa versa or from acct to acct within this app. Have been with MoneyLion for about a year. Couldn't be happier! Better than my bricks and mortar bank!"

val,"Money Lion has been good to me for over 10 years. But in the last 2 years their customer service and office members have not been up to par nor helpful in anyway at all when I have gone through my multiple unauthorized charges and had to dispute them. They have been very unreliable, unreasonable and very hard to get them to help me in anyway possible, knowing I needed the cash and it was definitely over the time frame they quoted me for my dispute to be rectified and my credits given back."
Gabby Dechant,"This app has been very helpful not only by being able to borrow & advance money, but also improving my credit."

Jones,Great help when you need it
Calvin Murray,It takes forever for the instacash max to bed available. And the fee is kinda expensive and they always try to put it into a roar account
Cinthia,Money Lion changed the external account that I have used to RoarMoney and I couldn’t change it back. I have spent hours in chat trying to resolve .  The two reps who “ helped” had me tied up for hours with no resolution.
christina,I absolutely love moneylion. I love being able to get money early when i need it without the super high interest rates

Kelli,Convenient & easy to use. Better than other similar services I’ve tried to use.
Whitnchris Whitnchris,Amazing...I might switch you to my main bank. So fast and the information on the app is precise and full of interesting options.  Thanks Money Lion.
kelly,Fees are too high and you ask us to tip you at least 3 times during each transaction.  If the fee was lower I could tip
hillary,MoneyLion instacash has saved me quite a few times. The instant access to funds that can be deposited immediately is handy and is significantly better than using a credit card because there are no insane interest rates. The credit builder loans offered through MoneyLion are also outstanding and easily help build your credit while giving you a sense of confidence and accomplishment when you pay them off and see your credit score rise. I couldn’t be happier with MoneyLion and they also have spectacular customer service.
trevor,Simply awesome product! Love it
CC,Excellent!!! Thank you so much.
Lisa M Stec,Pretty good wish I could change due date my job changed to every two weeks but it works
maydelen,Because to request a loan of $100 is 7.99 plus a tip so by the time you request $100 you're out of 115 to pay it back and I think that's ridiculous.
Tomika  Morris ,I love this app I got $325 before my payday
O.R.,"My favorite app, I swear I don’t even need another account."
jessica,Service is good. The only thing I don't like is they charge transfer fees plus they want tipped. Earnin app does not charge transfer fees and money goes into bank immediately.
marion,Much Love. Great fact the card can be used worldwide.
Matias Franco,One of the best and most complete financial apps  I've ever seen. You can take care of almost every financial need all in one app.
richie,MoneyLion is an awesome place to get instant money in a pinch if needed! 😊
brenda,Great service very much helpful in between checks
Colleen Allen,Easy to use. Quick to sign up.
adrienne,I didn’t recieve any information or help on my account
bryan reyes,Perfect in every day
Katrina Stephens,"There is some difficulty in connecting my bank, Varo Bank, through Plaid. MoneyLion does not seem to have the answer and different representatives give different, and opposing, instructions. I was instructed to contact Plaid, and was instructed that MoneyLion should be able to resolve the error. Apparently, my transactions and deposits are not being reported accurately from my bank, through Plaid, to MoneyLion. Plaid has no timeline on the resolution with Varo; MoneyLion does not offer a viable alternative, even though I have been a customer for almost 2 years, and they should retain some history of my transactions.All this being said, my Instacash amount varies wildly from $250 to ineligible. It would be more reassuring if there could be one voice regarding a customer service resolutions, and a consistent availability of offered services. Having such reliability would definitely sway my consideration in favor of moving my direct deposit to MoneyLion."
philip,"Easy, affordable .. always my go to option when I need a small short term boost! 👍"
"Ronnie-Citronelle,AL","Okay  …,,,,,,,,,,,,"
Keisha 29,Very good application
kevin,"Love it very much, so happy"
rodolfo,"I started 3 accounts with online banks about 4 years ago, MoneyLion is the only one I kept because they stayed true to what they were advertising, in fact in my opinion they've improved by adding more options like crypto.  They also haven't been sold to another bank. If you have bad to mediocre credit this bank will help you monitor and improve your credit score."
blanco sentya,This bank doesn’t charge fees to steal your money. Very upfront. Really like this company
john,"They seemed to know* I needed a bit of cash and spotted me $25, instantly!*didn't Actually know"
Devona,There when I need them and fair practices.
Sarah Bradley,I have tried every possible way to get cash advance and this app after over two years of looking into and trying everything to help my credit and find extra cash help in middle of the month when I'm beyond broke and someone told me about this app and I was hesitant and after a week I installed and tried it and instantly after signing up it gave me$10 which for a single mother out of work is really a lot and now after only a few months I've been able to start building my credit and I get advances weekly I love this app it's really was my light in the dark.
jaime,MoneyLion is always there when I need it. Quick easy process. Thank you MoneyLion
TY,This company definitely helps me out when I’m in need I appreciate everything they do thanks MoneyLion

lisa,The associates an representatives were very cooperative in fixing my accnt
laura,Great easy to use loved it!
Megan Brymer,"I’m happy with the Instacash app… but as far as the credit builder plus app, I have a couple issues. It doesn’t make sense that you only get the $250 and pay it back, along with the interest, membership fees for both apps, and tips…at least 4 different fees! That’s super excessive. I understand the tips and maybe 1 fee for membership. Then when I cancelled the credit builder plus app, I’m still getting charged the membership fees for both apps :( I cancelled credit builder plus Bc it completely defeats the purpose. I’m want to build my credit, SAVE money, and it’s nice to have the convenience of borrowing smaller amounts and paying back. It does NOT make sense to receive the $250 (credit builder) and once paid, you can’t get anything else until you pay $600 up front?!?!?! If I could do that, I wouldn’t need this app. So that’s why I cancelled that portion, and to top it off it was incredibly difficult to cancel. I had to call and be on hold 5 different times even though I had already paid back the $250 and all interest fees and was willing to pay whatever extra I needed too (which also was ridiculous but whatever)… I was willing to do just about anything to just cancel it. Honestly, Bc of that experience I would not feel comfortable opening a banking account with MoneyLion. I’m still getting charged double membership fees and was told that it will not be taken away. The only thing keeping me with MoneyLion is Instacash. It’s truly a lifesaver for me right now. I wish I had never even tried credit builder. Hopefully you guys can find a way to make some improvements to the app."
Valerie Lala Gonzales,I was in need of some additional funds to help me on a trip. I applied and was quickly assisted.
Kara stearns,Awesome service! Thank you!
michelle,"Great app so far, very easy user friendly to use. Instacash is amazing! Would definitely recommend to anyone seeking an alternative online bank!"

ricardo,It's handy to get and the terms are reasonable.
harley wilson,Very good l like use money lion’s
Kasandra Mercado,I was in need of life essentials and Money Lion was there for me.  I’ve endured hardships since last year and having this service has been a life saver.
Mattiesha,I needed money and there credit builder loan and I instacash were there when I needed them.
chandler,"Definitely the best money lending app, followed by Dave. Gives you help in a crunch without ridiculous fees"
chris,"Thanks for the help, it counts especially when its needed!"
"Teresa-Jacksonville,FL","It was fast, easy, and hassle free. U don't have to answer 100 questions to get the instacash. And best part is there is 0% apr. They are not trying to get rich off someone who is already broke and struggling to make ends meet. Thank you Moneylion. #ROAR"

takara,i love it money lion is tha best ever
Lauren Alexander,"Awesome, easy and reliable!!"
Natalie Reyes,I like the fact that once you get instant cash it is what it says instant 👍
Marlin,Money Lion has been pretty darn decent for me. They allow me to get a salary advance as long as it gets paid back. They were also able to approve me for a loan which with the very small payments on it my credit score is going to improve. I would not get a loan elsewhere if I begged nicely.
Cherisse Christian,Love this app. Has never failed me
Amall,"I really enjoy using the Moneylion app it’s very useful,"
Sam,"I wish I would have found money lion sooner. Around these hard times their (instacash option) really helped when my family and I were in need of a little bit of extra cash, just to get by in-between paychecks. It's basically a small payday loan with no insterest. You do pay a small fee to get it sent instantly, which is included in the amount you're getting, so you don't have to pay it right away, or it's free if you choose to wait 3-5 business days. I thought it was worth it and will continue to use it. Those small amounts really went a long way for my family."
Phanuel Ancient,I need a loan they grant it to me i get the funds 💵💰 deposited the same day. I pay them back on payday simple
Victoria,They have been a great help. I was out of work with my back for a couple days and that hit me hard. I thought I was lost because I don't ask anyone for anything. I found them and it's been a saving grace this week. I fully recommend their services.
sara,Everything has been great money lion is very knowledgeable when it comes to finances and what is best for you
tajamir,I’ve had money lion for years and the company keeps getting better and better. Very happy with all the new features they keep offering and the easy to read financial topics.  The only thing I wish they would improve  on is “live support.”

Chekeya,Very easy no hassles… awesome
dani,"Good company hobbled by a handful of smaller operational issues. I want to like this more, I wish I could rate higher.Been with them for years. I like their credit builder loan product, and I like how easy they make it to buy crypto.But everything about their edges is just rough. When something doesn't go right, nothing is ever resolved. Example:I want to start a new Moneylion Credit Builder Plus loan.The app glitched out, and when I get to the final screen? When I click continue? Error Message.I have talked to support 4 different times now with 4 different proposed solutions. Two of the solutions involved follow-up from them in some way - once they offered to send me DocuSign emails to finish everything that way, and the last times they said engineering would be reaching out. Neither actually happened. Unforced errors. Stupid.On top of that annoyance, the product changed. Now instead of a $500 microloan, it's $400 to the client with $100 kept in reserve. So now, not only can I not get a new little installment loan to keep in good standing on my credit report, I'm getting less cash whenever they do actually fix the problem. Stupid.Pairing my new bank account never worked. I haven't used Regions as my primary bank for over a year, but I can't pair my new main account with them because... Reasons. Stupid.They have had a few products ""coming soon"" for as long as I can remember. Credit cards? Forget it. Theyve been ""coming soon"" for 3+ years. Stupid. Larger loan amounts directly through them? ""Coming soon"", again, for years. Stupid.  They're great when stuff works but if something is broken don't expect them to fix it. Expect to waste your time pursuing a resolution that never comes.Edit: this response is a perfect encapsulation of all the complaints I've had thus far. I signed up to money lion using a personal email address that I have had for going on 20 years. The same email address was used to register for trustpilot, in fact it is the email address that alerted me to their reply. Somehow though, they can't find me.And just a feeling of overall unpreparedness or sloppiness, the dead hyperlink that was pasted into their official reply from the support team. This is the level of help to expect from this company. They have compelling offers, I've enjoyed using them for the most part, but if something goes wrong don't expect anyone to have the tools to figure it out.To create a link, highlight the text you want to convert and press CTRL+K. (CMD+K on Mac.)You're welcome.Lastly. The link supplied is dead. It leads to a 404 error page."

DO NOT use this app. I strongly strongly recommend against it."

Wakonda Richardson,"I’m the past several years I have been very pleased with Money lion and all of the services that are available. However in the past 2 months  things have gone crazy. Twice instacash has been given and then taken away. The first time 250 $just showed up  after my regular amount was allotted  . IDidn’t request it non the less I really appreciated the help  . Within 2 hrs the money disappeared with my explanation. I ask what happened. I got some  standard answer and a rude customer service member with a smart attitude. The second time was this month. I repaired my I instacash a few days early and I received my limit . The next day 200$ disappeared  . The customer service person said my deposits which have not changed at all didn’t match. He gave me the amounts of the deposits they were unchanged , however the wording for my state treasury deposit didn’t match and SS deposits all said SS for the last 3 months and beyond. ML computer system is flawed and needs help to read. I ask for a supervisor to explain. Non was available. Waiting on a call back. Of happening to me others are also dealing with this issue. I suggest ML  fix the issue asap and stop causing hardship to people already experiencing hardship. Thank you # fix your program # give explanations about each situation when it happens . # no  surprises. !!!"

andrea,I was so surprised when I received an email from Money lion stating that I was approved for instacash! The amount approved I believe it is anywhere between 10 to 15 percent of your paycheck.  It came thru when I really needed it! Thank you!!I recommend this to everyone!

raymond,"Be aware that Moneylion monitors your personal checking account and will randomly raise and lower your instacash based on that no matter if you pay them back perfectly. One day your instacash go up,then down. Not sure how they expect anyone to put their direct deposit with them to get 30% of it in instacash because they change it at will. I will just keep my direct deposit with my current bank. I have a line of credit that never changes. No surprises. 👎"

They’ve been able to loan me close to $500 if I needed it. Their have been times where I haven’t been able to pay it back right away and instead of other apps tacking on late fees over and over, my loan amount has stayed the same. Actually 3 weeks ago my wife and I were short on our mortgage because I was in the hospital and couldn’t pay it all….MoneyLion was there for us and I am so thankful from the bottom of my heart."
Roxanne,Excellent  Customer Service and Product  offerings.
sahrena,They are true to their word. Easy and quick for advances and they give you 2 weeks to repay what you barrow.
shaylee,"The insta cash fees are high. Since there is a charge for instacash, we should be able to choose full amounts to lessen the fees. We shoulde be able to spread out the payback amount since charged each transaction."

russell,"Easy way to borrow when short to get through to your next paycheck. SO SIMPLE, and EASY to use. The fees are great compared to other services and the credit builder loan is great as well. I use them all the time for credit builder loan."
Passion,"Love the $500 loan that builds my credit score. Bitcoin & Crypto now available & my account is growing lil by lil each month. Oh, I forgot about the cash advances until payday. This is definitely my safe haven😉"
danielle,Fast cash! Use just like a bank account without all the fees. Helps with boosting credit! I love this app!
Kim Roper,I’ve been a customer for the past 2 months and I must say when I need the money they are there. The only downside is you have to tip everytime taking away the full amount of money you receive and you end up paying back about $15 more depending on what you borrow. That’s my only drawback. But the money is there when I need it.
Dorothy McCullough,Great app definitely recommend
Jenni K.,Such a big help! I can depend on MoneyLion to be there when I need them.

Joshua Morris,I can always count on MoneyLion when I need them. Whether you need extra money or need some guidance on handling your money better. I’ve done the credit builder. Paid off once and started a new one. Such an easy way to build your credit back up. The best money app out there all around!
Loretta,Love it!! Must download
Marcie,"I got my miney right away, the only thing I don’t like is that the intacash amount change a lot and the fees too."
dandre,Amazing !! Very fast and reliable app 💯
tony,I have used other cash apps such as Dave the bear and this one I believe is more bang for your buck. In one week I was able to receive 100 whereas Dave only was up to 50 first time. Also I like how you can give an optional tip which has zero effect on your cash advance . It hits my account within seconds instantaneously. Zero issues or complaints.
Anonymous,"Charge too much for sending fee and want to add a tip too. It's too much. If you want a tip, it should be added as the sending fee. Can't do both"
ELS,"MoneyLion is always there when I need help. No interest, no processing fees.You have several options to leave a ""tip"", but it is not required.After my 1st loan was paid back, my available cash increased."

brandi,"A quick, effortless and simple system. One of the smoothest apps ever created"
heidi,"I’ve been with MoneyLion for over a year. But the relationship I have with MoneyLion has really made an impact on my financials. And they keep rewarding me with incentives such as increase instacash, cash back and investments. I truly believe they have my best interest when it comes to my financials. I know longer use my Wells Fargo account. Strictly MoneyLion"
Sue Haglund,Just when I need alittle help.
dalton,Why can't I request the entire amount instead of so much at a time?
Chris Taglienti,"Thank you very much, MoneyLion for always coming through for me! Great to do business with."
Amanda Ohler,I felt very welcomed at MoneyLion and thought it was going to allow me to be more responsible with goal driven financial success to reestablish credit and be on the fast track to financial success and be a financially stable person.  Yea This issue was from the start that my credit income changes tax audit compounded with a divorce litigation case that just surfaced.  No one in the team new how to address the issue of quickly paying my bills at cash cycle time. The unconventional insta cash is the reason to me leaving permently. The CSR Staff where very week and did not understand your rules refgilation and had a terrible attitude ewhen you challenged them. The tipping to receive instacash is a bunch of BS and if you pay it off early multiple times they lock you out
jodi,I love money lion it gives instant loans options all they need is your loyalty in paying it back thanks money lion

desdemona Noel,I like them they cool nd give you extra money when you need it
alanah,Thank you very helpful
Kirstie,"Chat customer service is a joke. They take forever to start chatting and finally when you get in contact with someone they won’t respond to chat after they asked you a question. This happened 3 times to me, where I waited for over 10 minutes after the agent asked me a question and couldn’t get a response back. But also I paid them back the repayment 2 days in advance. A day before the repayment was supposed to happen they charged me another $3. I said I didn’t want to tip and they forced that crap on me. Don’t give me an option if you’re going to force it on me anyway."
Vee,"The reason why I would actually give you guys an 4 star is because of the transaction part. I can't add an account external if it's not mine and I would like to add my brother's account to my Money Lion App, also that when I have added my card to do instant transfers you guys actually suspended my transactions and I don't know why. But other from that MoneyLion is a great thing to use because it's accurate but you need to try and updated the statues so that people can start adding accounts externally even if it's not their name on the account because basically that's why I can add another account to my MoneyLion external, but thank you and I hope this helps update stuff"
moises,It would have received a 5 star rating but the amounts you can advance change even after full payment has been made and your paycheck remains the same amount. Also the constant having to reconnect my bank info is frustrating.
marlena,MoneyLion has been a life changer for me in situations where we are desperate as a family to make it till pay day. Thank you!
William Walker,So far this app has been a huge help getting my finances straight after my divorce.  It has helped me get back on my feet and build my life back up again.
roy,Many great benefits!!  Great APP with many offers!!
Stephanie Yavonne R. WintersRa,Excellent extra money 💲 when you need it
Jonathan,"It’s not to bad , however once you receive a loan you tip them and then you still have to pay back more. EX: I got a 100 dollar loan gave a 4 dollar tip becuase a tip is recommended however I have to pay back 110 dollars. Also after paying it back the first time my limit went down. So all in all it’s ok but i think it’s a rip off as well. It’s all about what’s convenient to you."

Raul,"I’m a big fan! I’ve been using Money Lion for over a year and it comes in handy to tide you over. Unlike other companies, it will still advance you funds if your account is negative. You can also obtain a $500 loan if you choose and you can pay it back all at once or in low installments. You also receive increases in advanced with good payment history. The only thing I would change are the fees. They’re not super high but they add up!"
verone,Moneylion is the best app I have ever come across when you're late on a payment they don't charge you interest you get insta cash when you need it they don't charge interest on the in instacash you can make extra payments on your credit builder loan and you don't get penalized for it there are many many ATMs out there where you can pull money from it and not be charged an ATM fee this is the best app ever if I could give it a 10 star I definitely would 😎😎😎😎❤️❤️❤️❤️

Maria,I did not like how one pay period I was able to take out 635 but after I paid it back I was only able to take out 290 dollars. I was constantly able to take out the 600+ but not I’m not able to. This completely hurt my budget I was relying on the extra money to help with my finances. I don’t not like the fact that I paid 600+ and only was able to get back the 290. This app is very inconsistent and does offer much help anymore.

Lennae Bailey,Amazing app!!! Always on time and great customer service if ever needed! Simple to use app!
Sherri Haldane,Great!  Instacash is very helpful.
juliana,Great app love it. Only issue is with instacash .. I already unlocked up to $50 and I didn't get more cash right away and they took the 50 and put me down to 10 a few hrs later. And then I didn't tip them and now when I request instacash they block me out and there's a pic that comes up of a lion sleeping and it tells me to make sure I have the latest version of the app. Idk but it seems like they're alil salty about no getting a tip.. geez it was only once.
fs,Instantly approved me for 250 and a couple days later automatically increased my max instant cash by an additional 180.
ross,Love this app

virginia,"Excellent service, when needed, much better than the fees bank’s charge if you let your account go negative, it’s been a real life saver when life happens unexpectedly, and I’ve had to get things done with no other liquidity. I can’t thank the service enough. I have to be rigid to not allow this feature to become an every week crutch, but when it’s been needed, it’s the best."

Arteet Thamthavong,Awsome app comes through when really need it
charles,So far great! Better than my last bank.
C Setzer,"The services they offer are very helpful. The only issue I have is that there isn’t more detailed information available to view when using instacash or the MoneyLion credit builder loan. What they let you see in regard to each service that is utilized is pretty generic. It shows as basically a summary, with no detailed transaction reports. Im also not a fan of the limited amount available for each instacash request, regardless of the total amount available, but I also understand it’s how they make money. Outside of that, I’m happy with MoneyLion."
ash,Great on time when I needed the money just wish it would not take so long to go into bank account
april,Easy to use and comes in handy when you need extra cash
andrew,Moneylion is way better than a payday loan
KLE,Not sure what is going on at Moneylion but my employer sent my direct deposit Wednesday it is now Saturday and I still haven't been able to see MY FUNDS IN MY ACCOUNT!!!

I received my smaller amount Wednesday night.
Mar Mar,Good stuff. 👍 Need my money but I'm patient lol

Melissa Reeves,My issue was not resolved and they usually don't know what they are talking about.  They told me it would take 3 direct deposits to recognize my income.  Wth? I have been a with insta cash for almost two years. My direct deposits haven't changed since.  They once told me my bank is no longer qualified but that's was a lie to.

Jason V. Nipal,after having a perfect account no blemishes moneylion got my account hacked no other. Acct of mine was it was supposedly 6 months ago then they decrease my insta cash because apparently they close my Roar money account for fraudulent activity which I don't think happen and if it was nobody even bothered to tell me after four hours of phone calls and two phone calls meeting with managers there's nothing they can do to fix the situation and I pay them monthly on top of all this this is beyond a doubt the worst customer service I've ever had I advise everyone to stay clear of this place they're useless
chalane,Great app when you're stuck its bit more expensive than other apps but does push your payment to the following week if you borrow a lot which is super helpful
Ellie,Great App! Money Lion responds quickly when you need them! Great Customer Service!
Margo Wright ,Love itAwesome app.  Always a help in times of need
serenity hollabaugh,"I love the fact that I get my check earlier on top in between checks I can borrow from instacash. The only thing I dont like now is the turbo fee for each time you use instacash. The $5.99 adds up! But outside of that I love money lion. It gives me an option to also work on my credit. I have havent seen a difference yet ,hopefully I will soon."

G Lewis,Great app that’s really super fast and easy to use!! Love it!
Jay,Try it out for yourself
monica,"I REALLY like MoneyLion. It’s great! The only reason I gave it 4 stars, is because they said I was approved for the credit builder plus loan, and I went through the process and at the end it keeps saying I have an internet error. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, tried it on desktop, it says the same thing, but I keep getting emails to come back to finish and get my loan. I became a member, and the loan was part of it, but I can’t get to it.otherwise I would have given 5 stars."

maria,Great app! Quick Cash when in a pinch.
catrice,"I had clear fraud on my account that pretty much drained my account, called first thing that morning after cancelling my card to report it. They told me they had to wait for it to go through and then they cld fix it. Well once it went through my only option was to dispute it and they told me it will take 10 days to review and see if I “qualify” for a credit into my account. So basically someone stole all my money and now I’m having to wait 2-3 weeks to get it back. This all happened the same day I got a call from their fraud system and reported unauthorized transactions. They still let $1,100 in charges go through my account after that. They have no fraud prevention and cld care less ab ppl that are victims of fraud. I’ve been in banking 14 years and never had anything like this happen worst experience ever I will be closing my account once I’m returned my moneySo you just replied with the same lines I’ve been told for over a week now. I requested a copy of your fraud prevention policy and was never provided it. I wld like to know how and why you wld let $1,100 in charges be made right after I reported unauthorized activity to your fraud system. Why have me confirm that someone is trying to use my card and then allow them to drain my account? How does this happen? Do you just not care? Why even notify you of fraudulent activity if you allow it anyways?"
barbara,Money Lion’s  instant cash is always there when I need it! My investments are great and just happy to have a source to go to when the money is low! Thanks!

Mikey Mercer,I truly like money Lion. It's a great app. It's helping me out in a few different ways and I would recommend it to anyone. Thank you so much...
chad,"Fees are outrageous, Nearly every other App that is like this does not charge you what they do. And on top of that they only allow you to take $50 at a time and then they charge you five dollars for every $50 to take where is most other app started a minimum of 100. Also there’s a monthly fee to use that service which is $10 a month. Way too many fees rip off save your money"
DW509,"So happy to have moneygram, always there when you need them"
brenda,"I appreciate the small fee for an advance, and then also immediate service. Looking forward to building my credit score, with the options within MoneyLion.Thank you,"
Andrea,"Great banking option….The Roar money option is painless when you need a little extra cash.Fast, easy and safe… funds are transferred directly into your bank account. It could not be easer"
Casey,The best app I have found. They lend you a really good amount of money. They are fast processing and get you your money right away.
Miriam Fernandez,This comes app comes in very handy when I need emergency funds. I like how you reward people when they make their payments with more instacash available. The only addition I would make is a payment plan to pay back instacash through 2-4 payments. It seems when you get in a financial hole and need to borrow money you will stay in that hole because there is no way to graudually bounce back as you are immediatley paying the funds back.
jennifer,Excellent services for people that have little to no credit
Lee Clark Webb II,"Great app.., haven’t had any issues yet ..  wish I c borrow more money money though"
S king,Cash out fee a little to high😏 but it's convenient🌟

Al Pitts,It's definitely helped in situations where i need extra money fast i work in excavation and its weather permitted and bi weekly pay so if I'm short in between checks it helps my family tremendously!
Candace  Ezell,This product would be perfect and I would give more tips if it didn’t cost me $4.99 to get my advance instantly.It’s great that you can get more than $50 at a time now but the instant transfer should be free for loyal customers.
rrielle,This app is a life saver! Def the best decision I've made in 2021
Caleb Pomales,had problems switching phone and money lion to new one but money lion has been ABSOFUCKINGLUTLY awesome so far that they get (5)⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ anyways! Keep up the good work guys! Also a big shout out to Metabank for working with them!!!!

Richard L Mitchell,"Moneylion is great! If I have a bit too much time before I get paid, I know I don't have to be late on paying small bills or ration groceries. I can invest, and there's potential to raise credit through a loan. I can't partake in that last option yet, but I'm sure that day is coming."

Jon,"It needs to be a way to add and remove card. My card on file was was involved in some type of fraud in my checking account  and had to close the card. But I was not able to replace the card on MoneyLion for repayment. So therefore, I was not qualified for the amount I was getting before. It took literally a month before the repayment was taken out of my checking account, and I had a card to replace the bad card."

david,I am a big MoneyLion fan lately.  Their services are outstanding and I am very satisfied overall.  Today I was able to purchase Bitcoin using Instacash as an instant funding source.  This is the fastest way to get access to funds immediately.  I transferred $50 last Thursday on my Wells Fargo debit card and the funds are still not on my Roar debit card.
jessie,I would give 5 stars if there were more options for somebody with am unconventional income like myself.
Catizia ,"What can i say, needed a few dollars and Money Lion 🦁 always rescuing me 😌 Since I've been a customer they've always been there for me. Thank you and i look forward doing business with you."
Jonathan Middllestadt,"Money Lion is the best loan app, so seamless never any issues and I highly recommend it"
customer,Customer service is horrible! This is the 2nd time I’ve literally sat on the phone for an hour to get assistance because of a “glitch” Money Lion swears they have. Took payment from my debit card without any issue HOWEVER when it came to me getting an advance I couldn’t receive anything.  The first time I had to get it issued through my checking account which took two weeks just to receive!
antonia,Should be fast transfer to other banks not 4 days
Cynthia Green,Very good company to help you out with last minute issues come up. Instacash is incredible plus they are helping me build my credit and so far my credit score has gone up 30 points. I choose MoneyLion over all the other companies such as Dave or Albert.

Myron,I've been with MoneyLion for over a year now and I'm very happy with the service and products I receive from them. The only issue I have is that my balance hasn't been updated as I've paid my credit builder loan down for these last few payments. They will surely get it updated soon. I'd absolutely recommend to friends and family.
maria,This is the worst app ever
Makiya,"I have been using MoneyLion for about 2 years now and the only reason I have not tranfered all my accounts to moneylion is because I use a military bank for my primary. I highly recommend anyone looking for a banking with all the perks you need to use Money Lion, they will take care of all your banking needs and offer a lot of extra opportunities to grow your money. Instacash is the best because it is always there when you may need it and no interest is charged and ample time to pay it back.  It is great to have as a back up account too."
Shane McDonald,Help me out a lot wen I needed the most thanks
LORI ALDER,It's a good advance but to expensive for the payback
CHARLENE,I love it ..but the only thing I don't like is the fee prices and tip price being set for you

Ashley Brown,"My dear friends at money lion save me and my disabled Son every day for months now, we’d be in very bad shape if it was not for their love and outstanding service and many benefits and they care and not sharks that charge you 800 percent fees and worse, choose any one else to help you and it’s not going to work in your favor, I know from experience."

gabrielle,Everything is fine except the loan referral feature. I’m still trying to stop the texts and emails from all the loan companies.
Jamie Thomasson,Money Lion has been good to me from the beginning. I love the perks of shake and bank and earning rewards. I also love my investment account. It has grown. They are an all around great company to deal with.
cindy,it is so helpful like in times like tight and broke
amadis,"I absolutely love MoneyLion!!! It was so quick and easy to sign up and I was approved for a cash advance in just minutes. Im so glad I took the time to try it.

Amanda Aponte,"Great service, money when you need it"

Edwin Tesheep,Awesome!!! Thanks for your support and prayers for you and praise God.
Priena,After I said I was not the person who opened the account you took money from my account blocked me out and tried to play with my bank account but I also blocked you out. I just needed it closed before any money changed hand. But after our phone call you created new transactions  when then was none before my call
Mollykid,"Best service ever. If you need cash to help get you by don't hesitate, come here."

Shirley Chase,Money Lion is a great option to use when you’re running low on cash after paying bills and payday is just a few days away. The repayment is easy and you frequently get instacash boosts. Great for people without many options or who want to avoid payday loans.
Kenneth Meier,I received money within minutes! It was easy!
jennifer,Very nice app so far. A little slow on the cash back stuff. But it at least is actually doing it. I like the app. I get paid early. So far so good
Bill Snyder,"So far so good, I have no complaints, it was quick and easy to get a 50$ advance ( that's all I qualified for out of the ""250"" dollars that you can advance up to.) It only took a few minutes to sign up and receive my money, and I paid it back on time and was eligible again right away. I am, however, curious about their loan and procedure. I know you have to pay 29.99$ a month in order to be able to get the ""1000$"" loan, but what are the other requirements? They only give half of whatever amount they approve you for, and hold the rest til it's paid off, correct? How do you know how much you qualify for and do they have payment plans to pay it back ? Or do they just automatically take all your money every time they can until it is paid off?"
Sherry,I enjoy having this quick and easy MoneyLion  App at my fingertips. The information allows me to stay on top of my spending as well as build my finances for future endeavors.
TeresaGWT T,Awesome Y’all came right on time
Kourtney Walker Zarback,Great 👍love this app

do,Moneylion is awesome. And I'm not just saying that. It's one of the first apps that I have used to get an advance when times get a little bit rough. Everything is straightforward and it's easy. I think this is one that I will keep using for when I need it.
customer,"So easy to navigate, best part about it is in the name. It's instant! I love it."
Chad,"Awesome easy I use the free version and they still give me the largest amount I’m able to advance- and I got all my he advance apps. Customer service I tried to deal with 2x because they have a section that gives you your credit score- I have no idea where they get that info because none of that info is even relatively similar to me. They are tempted to tell me that they received the info from my bank that’s connected w the app and either neither again understood what I was complaining about or they had no idea what they were talking about. In fact on a graph of my credit score the most recent supposed info was in 2019. So I’m never approved for the credit builder loan which 14.99 a month is plus monthly payments interest - that’s wild. Chime has free credit builder that really elevated my score. There are plenty on internet “banks” that have a credit builder card and it costs nothing. You deposit your money into that account, buy stuff, and the money comes out but as credit not debit . But whatever money you put in is how much you have to spend and the money spent comes from the money u deposited. Exactly like a debit card except it’s a visa must be ran as credit and THEY ACTUALLY DO REPORT TO THE CREDIT Bureaus unlike what was being blasted all over social media and news outlets. I saw it today on my Experian report “exceptional payment history,” and I stopped using chime before the news broke that lie.But the credit score deal and the fact that they are using that fake info to deny me for their credit builder card is my only negative- no one & nothing is 100% on point perfect. Impossible. So yes, I think they still rock. The genius (paid part) is great. Lots of tools and advice. But I couldn’t afford it. To those who can it could be a really huge help!"
Kris Pope,Great to use I love it 😀 😍 😊
April Kaufman,Great for when you need quick cash before payday.. plus it’s easy to navigate the app so that’s a bonus
dave,"Awesome App/Website Overall was my Short Experience with them so far! They were one of the Few Site's, or Advance Apps that let me get a Small advance from Instacash a few short weeks after Signing up as a Customer! And then they Increased my Advance/ Short-term Loan by 50% after paying my small one back quickly, unlike other apps and sites online this one is Great and the Account is even better for someone like me!"
Carl,My husband is a truck driver and I know he has money at all times because of Moneylion. Best app I have seen.

annastasia,Money line is very efficient when receiving your paycheck as direct deposit seen as I get mine 2 days earlier than everybody else's however however they are also very lenient when it comes to paying bills there's been a couple times that I have been late on paying back the instication they have made in it like trying to press me or Or try to add interest onto what I owe and for that I'm grateful for now I'm always on time

rosalio,"Service is quick and easy, but I would prefer one cash out for my max amount with a tip and transfer fee.  Not multiple transactions to total that amount with an optional tip and $4.99 transfer fee to get in my account right away until I get the Money Lion card.  This makes a $300 loan cost almost $30 without the tips."
Johnny Collard,"I do enjoy using money lion. I'm not sure if you are required to leave a tip everytime but sometimes I can't and I feel bad. Other than that great, easy to use app."

brandon,This app has saved me a number of times when I was in a pinch this is one of the best and I think the safest apps around they make me feel very comfortable when it comes to borrowing money or making online purchases all I can say is there worth every star they show up top and more....Thank you Money lion...Robert Marcel Rodriguez
carlos,I've taken advantage of just about every service they have and haven't been disappointed in anything. I've only made 4 payments on my credit builder loan and my score has gone up 13 points already and that's with 3 negative reports on my credit report that I still need to take care of.

shellie,"These people are thieves.  I borrowed $150.00 and have paid these thieves  $254.00 in 3 months and they still will not close my account. In other words I paid 63% interest on this loan.  That is highway robbery.  They are loan sharks, plain and simple and I am reporting them to the SEC."
Rasheed Wingate,I wish I would’ve discovered this sooner. I have been facing some tough financial struggles and this company has helped me out a lot.
matthew,"Moneylion Helped me out when I needed it...Fast, quick and convenient.  It has saved me a lot of times. I would of given them 5 Stars, but the only draw back is they take the rush fee out  more then once"

Darrel,This is the very best app I have ever came in contact with or even heard about I mean right off the rip they was letting me borrow $250 and now after one week have a positive balance two days before payday which has never happened and I have investments along with crypto balance I mean this has been a game changer I fully recommend this app

Ehab Berjaoui,"Seems like a decent bank so far, lots of financial options to work on your credit if need be, a low fee loan program if you need it. It only lost a star because of that program, while you can qualify for quite a bit, you can only do $50 at a time and at $3.99 per (plus tip if you choose) having to do 2 or 4 of these sucks."

Kelly Pressnell,Love it! Love all the benefits.
Ronald Parker,"MoneyLion is the way banking should be customer oriented. I celebrate my 70th birthday on Oct. 28, 1951. I have Instacash and on my mobile app I can manage my account settings. I am a military veteran, retired USAF and my pension goes to Moneylion via direct deposit. I made a mistake in setting up my instacash repayment date. I set the repayment date for October 29, thinking that was the date my direct deposit would transfer to my MoneyLion account. I called and Moneylion explained that everything was ok - they would simply manually make the change on their end. No fees and great customer support from MoneyLion."
latajhia,Nice!  I love it
jessica,I was having to move on the spur of the moment and I needed a bit of financial help. MoneyLion was there for me! The setup was very easy and the deposits were extremely fast. I like the way they let u borrow (however many times)up to the specified set amount... That's a very unique feature in itself.
brandon,I absolutely love the flexibility this company offers! No hassle and no hidden fees. Perfect for anyone needing a short term loan until payday and is rebuilding their credit. Would definitely recommend to friends and family. Thank you!
Jesse Myers,I really enjoy using moneylion they have really helped me out alot not like other payday loans .I will definitely recommend them
michael,Great quick help in time of immediate need! Love the app and very grateful for it!
Aaron Jones,"I had gotten a 50ndollar advance from this app and payed it back on my payback date. After which i tried to get another 50 dollar advance but it went DOWN to 25 dollars and not only that it wouldn't put it on my bank card,bit put it in my ""roar account"" which i am not able to access, i don't have a card with this company, so the loan is useless. I don't know why it wouldn't just put it in my bank account like it did before. Very inconsistent"
Alexandra,Money Lion really comes through when you need them. Make sure to pay back your loans on time and they will have your back and let you loan more! Appreciate you. Thank you.
Tay,Money lion is the best. In time if need money lion is there to help resolve your financial situation.  I would refer money lion to anyone.

Robyn Ruder,Great Job Everyone
Ce Ce,"Surprisingly, it did great the first time! Considering we don't have direct deposit or good credit, they STILL allowed us to borrow $ and each time a little more than last. I have shared them with our friends and recommend to anyone. The only thing I have had an issue with is trying to add cash from my bank to my card. Customer service could not tell me why this happened, or give a solution. Not a deal breaker, but inconvenient."
sharon,I like it. Useful app
Anita Tippy McArthur,Moneylion always come through when you need them!
eusebio,"Enjoying this app a lot, easy to use the only reason I did not give 5 star is that my checks go to my savings account but only my checking account info will go threw, which means my paystubs are noted."
Roberto,Quick pay out on cash advance no interest very helpful!
April Brown,Professional and helpful customer service.
elise,They are there when I need them and the customer service is top notch.
kim,Just like a lion stocks and spray money line keeps your money in check always hunting for the next financial feast prowling ceaselessly for prosperity
shaylie,Okay to be clear I rarly take time out of my peasant existence to write a review for a banking app but ya know. The drink is bitin' and I'm in the zone after arriving from a hard days working for poop (poop I can say not gonna censor me again) ppl and even shitter pay. --anyway back to the review.  It was an easy set up with both my physical bank and card then having the InstaCash feature offered an incentive from the beginning. No lame hop to jump through or  crazy 'ask. Simple. Fast. Dependable. That's important to me having the ability to access the feature they offer quickly and easily. Overall its an (8.3)the experience today lead me hear mouthing off to this lot. If this type of thing appeals to you. Do it. I'm Dave and that's your app review. Cheers -B
dacia,"I went to companys trying to get a loanthey all turned me down. I went to my app looking for small loan app and I found Money Lion,and the rest is HISTORY. THANK YOU MONEY LION YALL ARE A BLESSING."

Lupe Espinoza,"Easy to use platform with the best all in one place! Checkings, crypto, investments, and overdraft!"
Thomas,"Awesome app, always there when i need it."
Chelsey Smith,Extremely greedy taking advantage of people in need of quick cash $250 instant cash instead of one transaction they force you to withdraw $50 at a time with $4.99 fee for instant transfer and want tips on top of that once I repay the loan never using moneylion again
Colette C,"amazing app, easy to use and quick"
harabella,Better then Dave cleo and brigit highly recommend this app. Only flaw I see is it u can only take out 50 at a time so to borrow 150 it's 15$ wish it could just let me take the 150 and charge me once instead of multiple transactions. Other then that it's great
Ella Johnson,"I loved this app at first. Until they double charged me and will not refund my money or even try to help!! They've left me with nothing, and now I can't buy food or diapers for my child! I'm a single mom with no help! They don't care about you or care to fix THEIR screwups!! This app is NOT worth it!! Scamers!!!"
Naomi Rule,It's best app ever
brandon,On 10/20 I requested $400 be withdrawn from checking to go to external account. I knew it would take 24 hours so I waited. On 10/21 I looked on account and saw that it was in some investment account with moneyloin. I immediately called customer service and was quickly given excuses as to why my funds could not be refunded immediately. I had taken out a loan but paid it back and I had another pending transaction that was not due until next paycheck. I was told by the representative that I would have to pay additional money to pay off the loan that was not due until next pay date. I explained to her that it could be taken out of the $200 that was in the account if that was the hold up. I then questioned how my money got into this investment account that I never set up never put money into and never authorized. She told me the account was set when I opened checking. With this company I only asked for checking. I proceeded to ask to speak to a manager. I am placed on hold long enough for them to talk and I get a call come through it’s the manager. He places me on hold to hang up with representative. Which immediately I found shaky. I mean I know it’s Covid but most big companies have switch boards. I spoke with him and while speaking with him we discovered low and behold this account I never set up had the same exact last for numbers as the external debit card I requested my funds to go to. He acknowledged he saw this but couldn’t do anything because it went to another company and that he would initiate a liquidation. I then said I didn’t want that and wanted refund. I requested the company that had my money contact. He then said sorry that’s all the information I have and pretty much told me they would have my mon for 5-7 business days but he would start process. Fast forward to 10/26. I kept checking the site and low and behold the withdrawal button that was grey was now lit up and I hit withdraw because I want my money. I then called and was told my withdrawal started 10/26 I then asked to speak to supervisor same thing got a call same guy. He tells me they started withdrawal 10/26 I then became angry and told him what he told me he then said I see you filed a complaint with BBB I said yes because you are withholding my funds and giving me the run around. He then became very dry and as before said I would have to wait. I later went on website and was able to see where they were at which was the beginning. Now today I can’t see anything and I still do not have my money. They have put me in a major struggle with this and as soon as my funds are returned I’m closing this account and never coming back!

nikki,They are so helpful and the instacash is a god sent.
James Hyde,"I paid the extra $4.99 and the money still is not In my account, that maybe it was because I did not tip this time around so I also tried for another loan paid another $4.99 and I tipped this time and the money still is not in my account.

Ead,"Moneylion does NOT release deposits when they are received, nor do they release SSI or SSA payments according to the calendar of any other ""get paid early"" card, such as NetSpend, Varo, Current, Ace Flair, Serve, or alike.  My other child's SSI goes to NetSpend and I received it over 24 hours ago, even though moneylion also uses Metabank.  They have been telling me it's ""pending"" and will be released any time between today, October 27th and November 1st.  Do NOT switch from NetSpend or similar, you will wait sometimes days longer for your deposit."
onlytrice,"i LOVE this app it has saved my ass so many times. Free money, easy automatic repayments, and flexible repayment dates. DOWNLOAD IT <3"
Rebecca Chapman,Reached out to support via email and phone call. Issue still hasn’t been resolved and it’s been almost a month . Keep having to verify the same information over and over again !
arthur,never lacks to impress me this app!
ti,Service is great. Your loan Credit builder loan helps build credit. Instacash is awesome service for quick cash needs. My reason for giving 4 stars and not 5 stars. There is a fee for every transaction and payments are broken down in 50.00 and below increments funding amount.
keyaira,Great every day banking app. However to offer loans or my favorite Credit Builder Plus which I really counted on using and was why I joined money lion but it's not a compatible bank to use credit builder plus so why offer it. Very disappointing.
chrystal,You guys take to much money. And I want to stop using the membership with you guys but it won’t let me.
tawana,Money Lion is awesome. When I'm in need of cash for emergencies they come through in a clutch. I highly recommend them. No credit check and super easy to get approved.
gabrial,"Good luck, annyux deschui goilo"
daniel,I need more cash please I have bills and need the extra for my food

ROBERT,It is easy and fast and really easy to pay back
PJ,"Great service, very helpful and simple to use"
michelle,STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY OR YOU WILL REGRET IT !!!!!!!Update 10/28/21After reply from Moneylion and using the link they provided to submit my information I received an email back stating I had used an outdated link to contact them and no other response has followed. Even the person responding to their reviews on here doesn't have the slightest idea of what is going on or what to do about it. I changed to the RoarMoney account because they said I would get paid 2 days early. I've been using Varo which does the same thing and would normally get my check today the 26th. I waited all day for my money and finally called to be told no I won't get it early it will be released on the 1st even though they have received it. When I complained they then say I will get it on the 30th which is Saturday. That's no earlier then a regular bank. All Monday deposits show up on Saturday morning. They lied about giving you it early. I will definitely be going back to my old bank varo. If I hadn't changed I would have my money right nowUpdate on 10/27: After reply by Moneylion I submitted the form to the link they provided. I will update again once I get a response.
Alexus Tate,Y’all are awesome I will soon be switching my direct deposits from my employer over to my account with y’all!!
VIRGINIA MONCADA,Love and appreciate the accessibility. Hate that there is not an option in choosing more than $50 increments charging fee for each. And....totally annoys me that tips are requested.
Diontrell Thompkins,Needed a trustful bank to work with and start building a better financial future for my family would recommend to anyone
Mrs R Wilkins,I have been with Money Lion for a few years now and I have been very happy with them even with some bad experiences. The problem I encountered was with my Instacash limitations that the system wasn't reading all of my income. After months of communicating with them about the situation they were finally able to get most of income to be recognized by the system. They are still working on one of them but they are caring and supportive of their customers and although they took a while to solve the problem they were persistent in their work. I have recommended Money Lion to my friends and family. Customer satisfaction is one of their strong points.
Danica Lindsey,I requested a loan of $25 dollars to cover gas and food for the rest of my day. Instead of depositing the money into my bank account like it did last time it instead went into a roarmoney account. THAT WAS NOT WAT I WANTED. Now I am unable to work for the rest of the day and probably won't get to eat until the money is transferred to my bank account. It never even gave me the option on which account I wanted it to go into. I AM INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTED AND WOULD LIKE BETTER CLARITY ABOUT WHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING!!!
clayton,Was very easy to get fast cash
Arinda Beaston,Highly recommend. Helped me out of a jam for sure!
David,Ever since using MoneyLion my credit has gone up substantially! The Instacash and loans have saved me from running out of money! Even got my best friend to use it! Best app invented in my opinion!! I've had this app since March of 2019!!
Mike thibodeu,Best app out and fair plus you can withdraw when needed to cover things
henry,Love this app. Thank you!
NaTasha,"I really like Money Lion. It has helpful things on the app like showing how much I spent on gas or eating out. The instant cash feature can be really helpful. Honestly, it's a great app to have and use. I'm even thinking about opening their roar money account now that I've used the app a while."
cynder,I've had a moneylion acct for a couple of yrs now and I only have 2 complaints. One of the main reasons I wanted a Moneylion acct was to help build my credit by opening a credit builder acct. My ck is direct deposited into my ML acct each month but I am ineligible because I have no sign in credentials. So my choices are either just forget about trying to get a credit builder acct or change my direct deposit to a different bank...very frustrating. Would have been nice to know this info upfront! The only other issue I have is customer service is almost nonexistent. Therefore they only get 3 stars from me..
adam,"Money lion came in clutch for me. Never thought I would need a small loan, but I did and I am greatful!"
customer,"Suddenly, the (free) regular delivery option for Instacash stopped working like it had in the past. It’s only giving me the option for instant delivery for $4.99. I chatted with a rep and called another, but they were both annoying, incompetent, unprofessional, and completely unhelpful. I did not get any email acknowledgement of a support ticket they supposedly raised. Then it gets worse. I call a third rep, and she says to check the agreement box and click confirm in order to get to a screen where I can choose my delivery option. I ask her if she’s sure that it won’t just immediately execute the Turbo delivery option and charge me $4.99. And that’s exactly what it did! She filed for a refund and gave me a reference number, but I haven’t received it yet not got anywhere close to getting my issue resolved. MoneyLion is The worst, hands down!"
augustin,I love this app and they are so willing to work w you if you can’t pay the loan back right away or in one lump sum
Rena Hall Tackett,Love it best thing to be invited to by friends
elizabeth,I am enjoying mone

Shirley Moore,i like moneylion but i also dislike it. instacash can one second say 150 and the next say 0 available. i dont like the fact that it can switch up on me when it feels like it.
Elyssa,I like it it's just took awhile for me to get my money and I ain't know how to earn points

If you use the instacash a few days before your payday, they automatically extend it to your next payday!If you need an extension until your next payday, they are willing. (Don't ask too many times)Customer service has been a pleasant experience thus far. I would highly recommend Moneylion."
bianca,InstaCash saved the day!   I was able to send my son the $ he needed for a school function when my deposit was unexpectedly delayed.  Thanks MoneyLion for saving the day!

katie,I was able to get the money I needed right away which allowed me to pay my car insurance on time and not have it lapse!
donterious,Life Saver!!!!
Stephanie,"I have been a customer of Moneylion for several years now and have recommended it to others. They are my favorite online bank.They have so many great programs, even if you need a loan, which I have used. But my favorite is Insta Cash and the investment Account. The insta cash really comes in handy when you are close to payday and need a little cash. The investment account is great for investing for the future. I have tried other investment brokers, but none IMO has come close to Moneylion when it comes to returns on your investment. I highly recommend them for all of your online banking needs."
customer,I've been using money lion since its inception and I've had nothing but a positive experience.
Dax Zal,Dedicated to accurately giving the tools and guiding a person foward to build a balanced financial future.
chris,"It's decent, comes in handy at times, although the 0% apr advertised on the advance seems to be misleading as the ""turbo"" fees and ""tips"" make up for that. Customer support can be a challenge . Beggars can't be choosers, I guess, and it is convenient at times."
michelle,Had no issue filling out any part of MoneyLion.
daniel,This is extremely user friendly. I recommend giving them a try and seeing for yourself
Amy,Fast and easy to use. Great help when you need it

lisa,"This app is great.   They only slight issue I have is that, currently, the instacash is $50 at a time, plus tip AND if you need it expressed, it is 4.99.  If you have a high limit instacash, and you have to max it out, for whatever reason, those fees are what is the killer.Like I said though, great resource when you need it in a pinch."

tiffany,So far so good!
lucille,It help me pay some bills that I was short on

Always struggling 🤦‍♀️,Gave me money when I needed it! Very helpful
bridget,I have literally tried Atleast 7 of these cash advance apps. Money lion offers the most benefits and is the easiest to work with . I spent an hour on another app entering my info and getting approved for a cash advance And they offered me 10$ when I was done . Money lion offers a fair amount based on your income .
jose carlos,I have been using MoneyLion for about 2-3 years and it is a very reputable service. I would recommend MoneyLion to those with a steady income who can afford to borrow a few hundred $$$ until payday.
Jay Margie Obregon III,"I love it! Quick deposits and love that you can set a payment reschedule. I would've gave them 5 stars, but if you don't leave tip they make you feel kind of guilty. I mean sometimes you probably can't afford to after they tax you for the turbo deposit."
SunNYgurl,This app awesome love it always on point.
Lida,I am giving 5 stars for convenience and ease of access to a loan when you need it. I do wish there were more options to paying back the instant cash though.

shanelle,So helpful I'm really thankful for them whenever I'm in need you guys are always there.
Shannon,This app is amazing. All you have to do is pass the requirements and continue to pay them back on time for your instacash to increase.
JUlia,"The app is amazing and helpful, instacash helps in a pinch when needed and the credit loan really helps work on my credit."

Rikki Johnson,I am very pleased and satisfied with Money Lion's services and will continue to use them for years to come.
Michael,Love love MoneyLion
courtney,"Here's the thing with money lion. If you do not have good credit they do help build credit with the whole loan program, the only problem I have is that literally once you calculate up all the fees that they charge you every month for that loan you've paid $120 in membership fees for a year and I'd say about an extra 40 bucks for interest & for me I rather just use a credit card. My interest wasn't that high though because I made sure to pay more every time I made a payment to bring my interest rate down but even the instacash, I feel bad because they ask you to leave a tip but dang by the time you take out the little money they charge you $5 to put it on your own debit card if you put it on their debit card you still have to pay a $3 fee at an ATM plus a dollar fee to them for using an outside ATM which totals up to $4, shoot you might as well slap on the extra buck and put it on your own debit card. Once it's time to pay them back I've already hit $15 in fees so to me that's their tip right tthere They only allow you to take out $50 at a time and every single time you take out money instantly you must pay the fee for it so if someone is hurting bad and they need to hit insta-cash up for 300 bucks you are looking at $30 dollars in payback fees. THEY DO GIVE YOU A FREE OPTION WHICH TAKES ABOUT 2 TO 3 DAYS TO TRANSFER TO YOUR BANK SO IF YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT YOU WILL BE STRUGGLING FOR THE WEEK YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND DO THAT AHEAD OF TIME. I guess I appreciate the app overall which is why I'm giving them this review because they have helped me out in moments where I didn't know what I was going to do."
joe,Great app really easy to navigate and use.
catelynn,This is the best app ever money lion 🦁 forever!!!!
QUEEN OF YOUR CIPHER ,Love them! Been with them for years!
mariam,"When you need help,  you can count on moneyLion."
Lea,It's a help when I need it. I'm glad it was there
jeremy,I love Money Lion and would recommend it to others.
Neek,"I feel like 4.99 is a lot for an instant advance, but I can’t complain because free takes two business days but 5pm at the end of day two it’s there.."
Cole,"Veryyyy good financial service. I've never had issues with my deposits or transfers or getting a loan. The only things I would change is how much intacash you can withdraw at a time and make more options for payments on your membership, loan or instacash. All of them should have instant transfer options beyond just the next pay cycle. It prevents me from paying more on my accounts in advance. Other than that this is the best debit card and financial services out."
maria,I need someone to contact me immediately you have a Miss informed pay date for me I do not want to mess up my account please have someone get in touch with me at 706-373-8637
julia,"Easy to use app, Great features, much more than simple banking and makes unexpected expenses easy to handle."
Brittney,The extra fees make paying the loan back very difficult
no,MoneyLion is honestly a pretty good bank alternative.
brenda,Money lion has helped me when I needed to borrow money and payday wasn't until 5 more days and is easy to pay the money back
Trevor Armes,I love this app!! It helps me out when I need money.
andrew,I've been using moneylion for a couple of years now and have nothing but great things to say about them. They've improved their support. The instcash feature is amazing and I've been using credit builder plus since they started offering it. I haven't felt comfortable enough to replace my traditional bank but maybe in the near future I will make the jump.
Shay,I was in need of fast cash for emergency they helped me out with out putting me threw the ringer and having to wait n sending me from lender to lender thank you money lion

jamie,"When another payday advance loan kept messing up, only giving me $50 dollar advances per pay period was a bummer. Then I signed up for MoneyLion and I the advances were 4X more and very friendly user interface"
kimberly,Money Lion charges way to much in monthly fees. $60.00 a month when the service is not even used. Too much for low income people who need a little help from time to time. Canceling service  ASAP.
nydaria,"I was hesitant at first but Money Lion has proven very beneficial and has taught me a lot about my spending habits and credit. I have never been into investing but I have opened an investment account with Money Lion, and I am so anxious to see how this goes!!"
rosa,"MoneyLion was there when I needed them most, they pulled me right out of a hole that I was in , when going through the loan process at a fast pace and not paying attention to all the questions, avoiding taking away the tip process, customer service was there and explained everything to make the process of extra money to be placed back into my account."
niara,Honestly money lion has been a huge help with rainy day funds and taking care of home and my family.
Court,Excellent service Thank You for helping during a emergency
customer,I like this app but when I referred a friend I never received my $50 instacash boost for doing so and o was told I would after October 6th
AzBorn,You guys lie to customers so they will stop calling about their account and money
kim,this card company is a great company and they are honest about giving Insta cash
Sedgley Burr,They were very helpful with Everything I needed.
TC MORENO,"Still have not recieved insta cash that was transferred to my debit account though money lion said successfully transferred, and it's been 48 hours"
elizabeth,"I love this app , it has helped me lot ."
Pleased,Do not have my correct payback date even though my bank account is linked with correct date. Charge $4.99 for instant pay. I wouldn’t mind if another app didn’t do it for free.
Grateful,Very easy to use.  Especially if you need cash in an emergency.
Michael Sewell,Moneylion has been a lifesaver multiple times. It helps your financial growth in so many different ways.
Shina,"Money lion has helped me begin to save and invest my money.. the payday advances are amazing.. and they offer opportunities to bring my net worth to a new level. So much information and advice available, I have decided to make it my main financial institution."

crystal,This app let me get more initially and faster than all the rest!
olga,Great service
Hand,Great app very useful ton of cool and new features that keep you engaged.
customer,"This has been a lifesaver. The only downfall to this app, is instead of being able to take out the money that you're approved for, you can only take out an increments of $50. Which if you do the send my money now it charges you so if you need $100 you're paying $10 to get that. I appreciate the app and what it's for but that is something that should be fixed or addressed."
yvonne d,"MoneyLion in itself is legit & great, but their outside offers give me scammy vibes. I started to fill out an application from their advertised partner and was sent hundreds of spam emails after."
mark,Great bank to have love the way the bank works with people money always on time and the cash back reward program are awesome
Kandi,MoneyLion is great! Always there when I need something.

nathaniel,"Great app, money instantly, great if you're In a tight spot and need to get through the week. Thank you for such a great instant cash app!"
HopeHeals,Needed cash quickly and I got it it was very easy to use the app.
gregory,"For the credit builder loan, should get at least half upfront since still paying it back"
teresa,"Do NOT use this ""bank""!!!! They will steal all your money and not give it back! They froze my account due to a deposit from a ring I stopped making payments on... Made me send pictures of all the receipts of the payments I had made on the ring, then as soon as they unfroze my account.... ALL MY MONEY WAS GONE! I reported the fraud the second they unfroze my account but they continued to claim they had no records of my report! Now 2.5 MONTHS later.... They STILL have not returned MY MONEY! They also keep telling me ""my supervisor will call you within the hour."" And they never call you back.... Moneylion statements say that if an investigation into fraudulent charges takes longer than 10 days they will credit your account the amount you believe is due back to you so you don't have to go with it, but they will NOT do this! I am reporting MoneyLion to the FTC and I found a lawyer who will sue them and I don't have to pay a dime because this is now bank fraud that MoneyLion has committed! Please do NOT get trapped in MoneyLion!"
Ashley Hodges,Always there when I'm running short. Fast and dependable
Tyrone Williams,This app is amazing an fx's really out here helping people get some extra cash
robert,Money lion is great very easy to use and had money in minutes
andrew,Moneylion has been good to me. I take care of my loan they look out for me in throw in extra which i am greatly appreciative of. If you don’t pay your loan I mean what do you expect you’ll be given a chance to pay it but if you know you can’t pay it back next time don’t take it.
christopher,"So far everything has been a breeze and I'm quite impressed about just how well this whole app is put together! I unfortunately had to wait a few months before getting to use it - but if everything stays exactly how it's been going or gets even better than it is right now, I could see this being one of the most highest rating apps out there for financial situations in all forms!!"
kyle,Yay when I needed help they were there
K.,I got my money fast and it was easy to get
Lydia,I love money loin! Its a great way to get your paychecks and they come 2 to 3 days quicker!

krystal,Very nice! Thank you
Kel,"Well I didn't get my roar card right away and then was gonna charge me extra to get it here faster. When my account had money in it. Then customer service was not good at all. Also you can only get 50 dollars at a time and then it charges you 4.99 on top of that. Fees are ridiculous, especially when you already are paying a membership fee."
ASHLEY CLEVELAND,Really good app if you're in a pinch or just need some extra money for the weekend.

andrea,Customer service is terrible.I recently lost my job so im trying to defer payment
John Torres,I love it that’s all I can really say there are very little issues but everything has a little issues in life nothing is perfect so don’t knock it till you try it
daquita,Very helpful app.  It allows you to have extra money.until payday.
catreska,MoneyLion is there when I need that extra cash! I love how easy it is to navigate!
Travis Amos,Easy to use. Large loans
Tee,If you apply for their credit builder loan...just to apply..you may end up a member paying $20 a month even though you don't get the loan.  The instacash is their best feature.  I leave a $2 tip except when I am charged $4.99 for same day deposit.
Gypsy Miranda,Got a charge of 3$ and no idea why.  Trying to get an agent but wait is over 30 minutes.  And really to send money instantly is 3.99. I can use another service where it’s free and tip big.
sarah,MoneyLion was a life saver during a very difficult period of time for us.
Sami,Awesome co easy transactions
sharon,"This is no gimmick. So hard these days to find honest, legitimate company's these days, especially in the financial community.

Carla,"I've had issues with MoneyLion for awhile, since they could never verify my identity. I made sure to provide accurate personal information yet I was never able to pass the verification step to open an account and I really wanted to open a credit builder with them. I called and emailed and was provided that their third party wasn't able to verify my information. I was told to try again after 30 days, which I did several times with the same outcome. Really disappoints me since I wanted to use their services and just have to give up and move on to different companies."
Danielle Forbes,"When I was down and out Money Lion was there to save me,ty"
Jonathan Carano,So far I really like money lion ive tried other places before like this one but its would always end up being frustrating but so far I like money lion
ricardo,The app is great
tengier,MoneyLion Is far Superior to It's Like businesses !  They don't cut me way back on borrowing amounts when I'm real Low In my bank account .   They have Live representatives to talk to.  And every so often when I do get Low on funds they will defer my payment I believe for 14 extra days .  And that helps since the account I pull from only has my pension ( once a month ) In It ...
Ken Wilson,"Very streamlined process, access to funds is very reliable with solid stable income."
kandace,Money Lion is a great app who offers a bunch of great products that are often real-world helpful. My only complaint would be the people I've spoken with this far in their customer service department are truly people to that I would never hire. They also have a tendency to pull their instacash availability just when you could use it most.
Mr. Rich,I appreciate the quick and instant cash helps when paycheck is a little short or just life happens. Thanks and fees not bad either

Monique Farmer,"It took 2 months to get my debit card and when I ordered a second one they both show up the same day. I had a $505 instacash balance when I went to sleep, then wake up to a balance of $145 and they cant tell me where it went. Needless to say I have about 13 family members who I recommended Moneylion to and we will be taking our business elsewhere."
Andy,Great for beginner investors and if you are need of little extra cash!!
roberto,"Money Lion has really come through in a pinch. I feel this is a company willing to take the risk on people with not-so-decent credit,  help them out with a few dollars and then a few dollars more, offer them banking and investing features while providing some basic financial education all on the chance that such people will appreciate such graciousness, pay back their debt, & build the trust to do it all again.    At least that's how it's working for me; and for these things I am truly grateful. Money Lion has given me the chance to start again,  making better choices this time."
Heather Mallory,Always excellent service. Instant cash is quick and easy. In 5 minutes is sent to your debit card.

Cynthia ,This is a great app that will help you build your credit...
james,Has been great with helping me with spending and credit. I love money lion it works for me
Ryanneil David,"Great app. Just don't like that you can only borrow 50 at a time even if your limit is way over. Makes it seem as though they deliberately do it that way to charge you a fee for each transaction. Which would be ok, if they didn't ALSO ask for a tip each time."
robert carr,I requested funds to be sent to my account in the 5 to 7 days. Well I never got the funds but they took the 236 out of my account. I have been trying to get my money back for about 6months. 🤬🤬🤬
steven,I've used Money Lion many times. It's fast and easy. Literally has saved me from pay check to pay check.

travaris,Love using MoneyLion. Love the credit builder loan and instacash options also
christine,"Love thus app because you can invest money, borrow money without a credit check and get it instantly!"
Levon &La'Vonna,"Helpful, knowledgeable"
jessica,"Very easy and helpful banking and fast cash ""instacash"" for those times of need and short on funding  only down side I'd honestly say is when you do the instacash their is a ""tip"" area for getting the funds you want or need. They start with an automatic $5 and goes as low as $2 but goes higher than $5. If you choose the no tip option they send quick message on screen kinda makes you feel bad but they have a $3.99 service charge to get it instantly even tho it's called instacash that means to me you get it right then not pay $3.99 so you can get it right now and also have to leave a tip.  They say it's not free and they are right they get $3.99 when you get it right then and then  tip. I don't want to sound un-greatful but if your getting that money the your probably already in need and having some issues financially so every dollar kept is better for individual.  I appreciate this app and money lion more than you'd guess by this review but it said be honest so that's exactly what I am doing. I have chosen no tip before and I already fee extremely horrible for asking for help and then reading that message just made me feel even worse but then I was able to get the house hold Items needed for our kids and family so I just sucked it up bitter cup.  One day hopefully I'll be able to get ahead enuf that I'm squared away and won't need to do instacash and will be able to purchase more crypto instead also brings to next awesome point you can do investing with the app as platform for another app/platform and moneylion is just facilitating the safe space to allow you to invest as you wish  amazing features I have my S.O. hooked up now finally and am waiting for rest of my peoples to set up and get hooked up. The more they do the more insensitive they provide for me as well  AIRBORNE ALL THE WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THANK YOU MONEYLION 💰 🤑 💸 💲 🪙 💶 💰 🤑 💸 💲 🪙 💶 FEELS GOOD TO HAVE THIS SUPPORT ESPECIALLY DURING THESE TRYING TIMES WE LIVE IN AND LACK OF ABILITY TO HAVE EVERYONE AROUND LIKE PRE-COVID DAYS AND HELP IS JUST A CLICK AWAY  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND SERVICES TO US ALL WHO ARE BENEFITING FROM THE AVABILITY OF FINANCIAL SERVICES available to us in time of need. Awesomeness 👌 👌 👌 👏 👍💯🤙👌🤙💯👊💯🫀💪"

elias,Came in handy when I needed cash fast!!! I love it❤️
angel,It helps build your credit and reports to all 3 credit bureaus. I love it!
steven,Awsome feature in a jam !!
Elita CabbaGestalk,The cash advance process is easy but they don’t let you take the full amount you’re eligible for at one time which is inconvenient. If I’m approved for $85 let me take the whole thing the first time instead only $50 is available and they end up getting more fees and tips from me. I still get the money which is so helpful when I need it.
Northernlight,Money Lion has provided me  Financial assistance when I've needed it the most but at the most. Using their system is very easy and effective and I have enjoyed working working with their financial products.
PN,This is a great app especially when your in a bind and need a few dollars until payday definitely recommends this app to anyone

I recommend this app all the time to people. Only have talked to support once and they were super helpful and very easy to work with. Amazing app!
evelyn,"Money lion is designed for the average joe that’s trying to save & invest. Money lion rewards cash back up to the full amount if your lucky just shake and wait cash back is available on all purchases. There’s so much to take advantage of like boosters to get you out of though situations up to 300$ at 0% and building credit by paying off 500$  You Are given 100$ upfront at 0% then when paid off you get the 400$ and got better credit it’s a win win, there’s so much more to take advantage of find your roar inside of you and take back your Finacal freedom with MoneyLion 😏"

Brenda,"I wanted to shout out MoneyLion for being awesome. I have a less than perfect credit history and they are making it easy to work with them. With anything good it's a process of gaining trust and being open with your financial situation. They have provided tons of insight and guidance and at this point have even helped me out when I needed it most. You dont have to tip for the help either!  (I did thought, they deserved it). Thanks or making my money roar MoneyLion!"
david,The loan solution using instant cash. The trusted choice for helping people who find themselves broke and need money. A trusted choice and very safe lending options. The best company. Who truly cares about helping people who find themselves broke and need a quick fix.
Brittany ,Moneylion has helped me get my financial life stable and in check. I recommend Moneylion to anyone.
christine,The app is easy to use no hassles and you receive your money same day

Christy Goosman Manchester,I absolutely love how easy and convenient it is to utilize the services offered the only thing I wish they would change is when you're taking your cash advance that it would allow you to take larger increments of money instead of just $50 other than that I've been so happy with this Bank
Monique Dimas,They Let You Get A Cash Advance And Every Time You Pay It Back You Can Get More. You Set Your Auto Pay Back Date And After It’s Paid You Can Do It Again. It’s Always On Time

Heidi,"MoneyLion is fast, helpful and easy to use!"
Flexx Hunna,I was leery at first but they've turned out to be a great company very honest no hidden fees do as they say they will and you can't go wrong with that when you trust in something you can make things happen
matt,"My experience started out great. I was able to set up my account with no issues and learn about my spending habits as well as loan if needed. But it has all turned on me. My account was hacked, I can't loan even though I have an available balance and there is no customer support to talk to. If I am able to fixmthese issues 5 stars all around."
elise,Awesome app! So helpful! Never a glitch! Highly recommend
Ho,Thanks for supporting me in my time of need. Blessings 🙌 😇
rod,This app MoneyLion was amazing‼️ This came to me at the right time. I am in the middle of building my credit and am having trouble being approved for a credit card since having to file for bankruptcy last year. I like that the they give you the option to tip for there services. It is the courtesy thing to do is tip and MoneyLion suggest the amount. But yet keep in mind we are asking for a loan. I don’t want to dig my pockets deeper then I already am. So I like that there is an option to where you can give a tip in they amount you can afford or budget I would have to say. I am very pleased with there services. Thank you 😊 very much for helping me in my time of need and hardship.
Sarah McBride,Love it 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
tierra,"Moneylion has been good and bad, as of late mainly terrible. I have been traveling a lot this summer, so I've had my fair share of pre-authorizations, I have used different debit cards that I own along the way, Moneylion has been by far the worst,they have had me waiting for up to 28 days for a release, even AFTER the hotel has sent over the authorization release and final bill. It's a joke, this morning I had a chat rep by the name of Joan waste over an hour of my time telling me she was releasing my funds specifically mentioning the amount and then only to be told after 45 minutes of waiting around for her that she was looking at the wrong document."
Susan D.,Excellent. Thank you
Amanda,It's so easy to use makes my like yrs
nicky,I LOVE this app. Such a lifesaver!!!!!
Rachel Risby,Thank you for being there when I needed a little extra cash!!!!
DL,Quick and easy to use. Money was in my account in less then 3 minutes.
Erica Brawner,Had a few hiccups but otherwise has been a good service.
Britt,"Moneylion from day one has been an awesome account to have! The instant cash has come in handy when I have been in a pinch and they have so many other options! From a creditbuilder loan, to buying crypto, invest your money and just forget about it and they will do the rest for you, but if that isn't what you want to do you have the option to manage the investment account on your own! Cashback deals and many other resources build for everyone and it doesn't matter what type of situation you are in! They have quickly helped me any time i have had questions and reached out to customer service! The only reason I didnt give 5 stars is because I have withdrawn money once in my investment account and I still havent seen it arrive in my account yet... I talked to someone but they might have misunderstood what i was asking and told me it would be 7 to 10 days before i would see it arrive.... I started the withdrawl on September 30th and its now October 12th... My other investment account takes me the 3 waiting days and my money is accounted for in my banking account. So that may need some improvment.. or im just unlucky and some issues happend that are going to be resolved hopefully soon... Other than that one complaint I think they have a really great concept and hope they keep adding more features to help people out especially people when they are in a bad spot and need some extra money for emergency situations!"
aimee,"Pretty great, helps ya get your finances in order and can help ya when in a pinch"

stephen,"I really like money lion so far, it's very convenient and keeps me up to date with my spending."
CurlyGirly,It's been great with cash advances they boost you up so quickly and and it's really instant like they say. They do charge  for every 50$ advance which I wish they didn't do but all in all it's great app.
rachel,"I am very, very dissatisfied with MoneyLion. I will NEVER do business with this company again, unless they can fix my situation, which they have not done. They are a complete rip-off. Do not do business with these people, they have taken money out of my account for payments to my loan and did not apply it to the balance of my loan. They have said that my account was charged-out, but yet and still I have an active account with on time payments. They do not take responsibility of none of their faults, and believe me when I say they have plenty. They always find a way to tell the customer that it is their fault and never refund or fix your account to rectify the problem that they caused. I repeat, do not do business with this company. I will soon be finish with my loan and I will not have any more dealing with this company! Don’t deal with them!"

The first time I didn't get any alerts from the Roar Money Lion app about suspicious activity or anything. The second time there were 14 charges from India. FDIC insured but unacceptable bank security. No problems since April and I'm still with them for now #instacashCurrently searching for good credit unions."

PCYETA HUDSON,Great service to front 25$ with a 4$ repayment fee.

Ohio ,I like everything about this app except for when you transfer money from your lion account to a different one that it takes long and I transfered money from my account to my investment account on accident and I had to wait 4 or 5 days for it to show and then transfer it back so I could use the money and it took another 4 or 5 days that is the only to things I do not like. And I wish I could cash out with cash app.
james,"Good service, good customer service!"
KAT,I'm impressed with moneylion so far I really im
Teri,Excellent app. Been a lifesaverbee
Itsme,"I absolutely LOVE this app! I was referred to it by a friend when i was in a bind. I was very skeptical about it as i would need to put in my personal information. But i took a leap of faith and this will be the O N L Y loan app i will ever use ! It’s quick, easy, and i got my funds in an instant!Kudos to you MoneyLion! Thank you for being there when i really needed it!"
SarifRaden,Disappointed. Frustrated with my recent cheat session. Hoping to get clarification on why a Instacash request from 5 days prior had yet to show up in my checking account. Representative wasn't helpful at all.

Walter Caldwell,Very informative on their products. Willingness to help 24/7 and will quickly correct any mistakes.
Elizabeth Cronk,UPDATE: So I've been using this service for a little over a month and I can say it is by far the best app that loans you money until payday. If you need cash fast until your next pay day I would for sure pick MoneyLion over any of the other apps. Fast easy cash when you need it.
Rashydah,The service was fast and quick and easy
melissa,I do not have an account yet I keep getting stupid emails about instacash. Stop sending me stuff
Caleb Hayes,I love it. It's fast and easy and I have no problems
megan,Easy and convenient ..loved the option
briana,"This Servoce has been terrific with  a couple of unexpected issues happened,  so simple to use."
stephanie,Great experience always got my money on time.
TT,"This company is a rip off.... they basically give you a loan for a large amount of money but put most of it in reserve. So you are paying on a loan that you didn't receive. Given an example, you get a loan for $1000 dollars but they only give you $300 and now you have to pay interest on a $1000 loan for 24 months. Now if you catch on to what they are doing and decide to pay the loan back. They will require you to pay $1000 dollars back and hold $700 of your money for 7 business days. This means they are holding money that you didn't even borrow. Do not get this loan. With that being said, I paid $48 out of pocket for a $300 loan for 2 weeks and in order to pay the $300 back I had to come up with $1000 and now they have been holding my funds for over a week. When I called they said I will have to wait another 7 days to get Money back that technically I didn't borrow and doesn't belong to them."
christine,Quick and easy by far the best app of its kind
Caitlyn Johnson,So far I have nothing bad to say about this app. I got a loan when I needed it n when I couldn't pay it back in time they worked it out with me without adding extra fees..
raem prim,Awesome service! Thanks again
LSS,If you need cash quick without a problem this is the app for you.
Elizabeth,MoneyLion has been such a user-friendly application that gets me what I need fast. I can rely on them to help me when I'm in a patch. The best part is you are able to withdraw immediately after repaying and your limit increases significantly in a short time span. The Credit Builder loan has helped increase my credit score tremendously.
brittany,Amazing app love it always getting in advance and they're always making my advances cash them out higher love it and even if I'm late and I still paid a couple of days late they never penalize it
Teresa Metcalf,"So far, things have been pretty smooth. Most things are pretty straight forward. It's nice having a way to borrow extra cash to push me through without the hassle of a payday loan place. I appreciate a way to build my credit file, what confused me is the reoccurring 20$ monthly charge, not exactly sure what I'm paying for, at this point I've chalked it up to a monthly fee for the ability to build credit through their loan process. Other then that, I'm loving Moneylion!"
Jody Trusty,Money lion really helped me out when I was in a bind and came through for me. Thee best site to borrow money until your paycheck.
Lynn F.,This app is great. Easy setup and approval. I recommend everyone try it

Felicia Day,I am always seeking for loan where it can be beneficial for Me as to where it not only helps me at the time when I really NEED CASH but to where it HELPS BUILD MY CREDIT! AWESOME LOAN OPPORTUNITY for those with Bad Credit or No Credit. Money Lion will help you. Just trust in the process and it you'll see a difference.
Amanda Woody,Love this company. Very easy
vincent,I love the advances and the fact that they care
elias,"This is the perfect contact if your unaware of how to do anything with loans, credit solutions when you need to increase your score, or even if you just want to borrow 50 bucks to gas up your car for the week.I highly recommend to anyone of all ages.Jeff"
Sasha,Good service if you need cash right away before payday. Be cautious the withdraw for repayment will come out before midnight the night of scheduled date and can cause you NSF fees.
michael,So far the service has proved better than expected. The instacash loans come in super handy when you need a little cash to hold you over. I'd recommend to anyone asking.
Felicia,The experience is OK and all but  It's just when you're advertising that you will give people the amount that you're saying and you don't and they have to wait they're really that's false advertisements so I really believe that you know if you're gonna advertise something do it
janaye,Great app to use and very helpful if money is tight in between paydates.
jk,Money lion is the best

marissa,"Money when I needed it, low to no fees. What's not to love?"
salvador,Helpful and easy
Raven Smith,This is great and helps when needed
Randy Coker,I would give it 5 stars but I feel like instacash should give you an option of how much and not just $50 at a time with a $3.99 fee.. it don't matter about the fee but each time
Esther Leach (Stella),Don’t know where to look to see where investment money is
Maria Smith,I have no problem with this app yall was very helpful.

leslie,"You have been unable to fix the problem of adding a different bank account. I've tried customer service three times, and they keep saying check with my bank.  The information is correct, and it's frustrating this can't be fixed. I'm a LONG time member with your company. Not to mention how difficult it is to get a live person on the phone."

israel,"a few months from retirement I started looking for a bank that could satisfy my banking, as well as financial needs such as short term loans,  payday advances and since I was managing my own retirement, investment services.like most Americans I was using a  local community bank. 1 year into retirement ive decided Moneylion is for me.  I have 2 govt direct deposits both are now with moneylion, that transition had a few bumps but they didn't leave a bruise..thanks moneylion"

william,"I've been with Money Lion for a few years now, there was an issue with NFCU working with them but that was a while back. Maybe they will correct the issues we had and things will be better.

travis,One of the easiest online banking apps I've ever used. Easy to sign on and maneuver through with just a click of your finger.
Stefani Casey,Moneylion was there and has been there when I needed some extra cash for bills. I'm just not a fan of only being able to get fifty dollars at a time. That creates a bigger bill for me to have to pay back. It would be nice to get it all at one time and only have to pay the one time transaction fee instead of three or four fees.
archie,MoneyLion has the right tools for you as long as you use them.
amy,Right then and there cash just started using and it's amazing easy to do and all !
jacob,yup fu hf f ug shh just FYI hg shh just dry hf v h
Wanda Lowery,"Super helpful. Been building my credit, getting instant short term & long term loans, as needed and also tracking my spending."
karen Jean Baptiste,This app really helps in desperate times.
sulynn,"moneylion they have helped me in so many different ways did I say help??? They charge for all in if it!!!  too many to really post about but credit rebuilding, Bitcoin, crypto, trivia, cash advances. The thing I don't like the most is the reference to loans like fiver it's all a run around a joke and it makes me angry bc I am currently behind on everything my lights rent credit cards I have no phone my kids have no phone and it's all due to 2 mistakes 1 the bank did and 1 my landlord made but I have to pay for them fun so I could use a 10000 dollar loan and I would make the payments on time because and be current bc I would be caught up. But no this world is backwards the ppl who struggle pay more and get less so sad. Oh and asking for a tip when we already pay 4 dollars to get our Instacash instantly is ridiculous it's done by computer no human moves that fast and u say no fees no interest but limit it to 50 dollars so I have to pay 5 times and borrow 350 pay back over 400 makes no sense credit builder I have to pay a fee monthly for that hello I have bad credit I have no money I have to live on 750 dollars a mo a single mom with 3 kids  as u can see and u take and take and take but I need it so I continue to give but In my eyes your crooks like asking for a tip and when u say no u go to the next page and get one anyway bc I'm pushing buttons too fast stealing is what ur doing is this going to fix any of it probably not but unless u can afford this app I don't recommend it at all"

Drew K. ,Best app I ever had gives u the money instantly

Dream,Has potential for being a great app. Only allows $50 per transaction and charges you $4.99 each transaction up to $250. So you end up paying $275 if you want the money the same day. And it's asking for $5 tips. Not a good look. Fix this!!!!

robin,Easy! Convenien!!
maurice,"They've been a lifesaver to me and I've been able to get ahead of my higher utility bills and stuff with everything that's going on over the last year and I'm just going on my second instacash, and definitely switching my direct deposit. When I need it most everything's always been decline, decline, decline. (I guess I can't really say much you know when you have a poor disability income)so I ran across moneylion and was approved with of course my proof of income that reoccurs I'm grateful of the amounts and the fact that they're not forcing you to take it all. What you are eligible for is there when you need it. Thank you so much you've definitely been a helping hand and then some!"
Camryn,"It’s a very helpful app with a lot of different resources and easy to receive funds when needed. Only drawback is the leave a tip option for every loan. Not so bad if your able to do 1 transaction for the full loan amount, but it’s in increments of 50. So if your approved for 300 bucks in Instacash and want it all, you need to do it in 6 transaction."
Robert,Easy and straightforward. Love my experience

Anonymous,"Money Lion is great. Not only can I get guidance on my spending habits, but I can also monitor my credit. My favorite feature is the instant cash that had helped me numerous times in getting thru to the next payday."
Patrick,"I gotta say, while you have to give them the trust to access you bank account and basically know everything needed to steal your identity if they wanted to - no, this is a legit internet bank and you would have to give Wells Fargo all the same information.

Glen Zentner,Best app I've ever experienced. So many things have happened to me lately during this time of the pandemic and I really doubted have any hope getting financial help until I downloaded this app. I can truly say with all honesty it is the most trust worthy app to getting financial help. The process is a piece of cake and everything explained in detail before choosing what works best for you and I can tell you I don't have great credit but they still helped me soo much. I love this app and I encourage everyone in needed of financial assistance or building your credit to take a look into this app. I don't regret it and I believe you won't either. Good luck and give it a try.

bry blu,"When I first signed up I was a bit skeptical because so many times you find these various apps to not deliver what they promise. I have to say I've found Money Lion to provide not only a quick, honest, and fair lending source for times when you may need some emergency funds, butthey also have helped my credit! My score has gone up since using their plan that assists with this. And believe it or not that have a great customer service team you can call! I feel confident in their product and I highly recommend them."

Derek,I need quick cash and that's exactly what I got $50 in a matter of seconds! Thanks moneylion!! Your da best!
Jack Pevahouse,Always there for the extra help when most needed!! Thanks Money Lion!
Jennyfer,"Although I do love being able to borrow money, I'm not a big fan of how to deposit the money. I don't like that it's only in $50 spurts and each time you request a loan you have to leave a tip. Although the tip option is ""optional"", each time you dont leave a tip the app essentially guilts you or it reminds you that you should tip. I feel like if you have the option to request a higher amount, your limit should be $100 each request. Not $50. I get the app is trying to make some money but having to tip each time is pretty wild. I would need $200 and end up paying $50 extra in tips and the turbo charges."
jayden asmr,Great appt to have in case of an emergency Love it.
Lisa,LOVE Money Lion! I am so happy I found you! Amazing customer service. Congrats on going public. Nice to see a company that helps others to be financially successful become a huge success itself!

christina,I love the instacash it's been beyond a blessing to bump into this feature especially since I've been struggling throughout the pandemic
cleo,"Though I can't get some of the figures you work, Moneylion has come through when I was in a bind!"
ce,They are so complicated to work with and they're customers service is even worse why you better have a bank you can lay hands on or your f**&^!d!
CM,I really like this app.  It would be even easier if the limits to how much you can request would be bigger so you don't have to request the $$ more then once to get the full amount your have available
DAnthony Chattams,So far I have not one bad thing to say about this app. In fact I want to say thank you you guys have helped me out of a tight spot I didn't have anywhere else to turn I will definitely spread the word
Carolle Oma Brulee Wilson,Love it! There when I need it most!
anonymous,Great comps helped when I needed
Carlos Da Boss Diaz,Moneylion is a good company to deal with you get your money real fast
Chikyra Collins,I absolutely love MoneyLion; especially the InstaCash feature. As long as you link an account with them; you can use the instacash feature. I love that you can borrow money until payday and all you pay is $3.99 if you want it instantly. If you were to borrow from a loan company; you would have to pay back double.
Fred Rose,I absolutely loved the service and convenience moneylion offers. Thank you
Jim,"Great app I'm unsure of how to sign up for direct deposit with SSI income, but other than that wonderful app."
cj zamorano,"Tried to close my account in Sept 2021, and just as before, their customer service is lukewarm garbage, practically non-existent. It took me forever to get a rep on the phone, through a maze of IVR menus and long pre-recorded messages, which I finally navigated to speak to a human. The rep is clearly reading from scripts, and has left me sitting on hold for at least 20 minutes (while we only interacted for about 2 minutes). He never even bothered to ask me why I'm closing my account. I requested full deletion from their database (per my legal rights as a US consumer); the rep cannot tell me exactly what personal information they'll be holding onto, after my deletion request. He referred me to their site's Terms and Conditions, which also do not state exactly what pieces of my personal information they'll be holding onto. So now I'm hold for a supervisor; the rep tried to get me to ""wait for a call back from a supervisor within 24 hours"" but I said no, I'll hold, because I know better than to think I can count on this company to follow up. It's been 10 minutes on hold waiting for an available supervisor, to tell me exactly what personal information of mine they'll be keeping - because that is not listed in the website's terms and conditions. We're in the age of identity breaches folks, and this ""bank"" that's now publicly traded, and farms out their support calls overseas, can't even tell you exactly what of your personal information they'll be keeping after you *try* to close your account (SS#? DOB? The ingredients for *another* identity breach, through a bank that's impossible to get ahold of on the phone?). Their website won't even let you change your address, or phone number. Stay far, far, far, away. Find a local credit union, or set fire to your hard-earned cash, because that's better than being bitten by MoneyLion. MoneyLion is not a bank; they should never have been given a license to do banking business in the US. It's a scam, to steal your money, waste your time, and pad the pockets of stockholders, thanks to their recent IPO. I feel sorry for anyone who has ever given them a dime of their money, or a minute of their time.Sept 2021 Update: After 65 minutes on the phone with the first rep, a supervisor finally called me from another line. She said they will be reviewing their IVR menu, and their policies for when a customer calls to cancel their account. I still say, stay far away from this publicly traded bank, because they're clearly not spending that IPO money on more call center staffing. Otherwise it wouldn't have taken me almost 75 minutes to get an answer that any local bank teller could have given me in 75 seconds.Original review on Play store, from fall 2019: Tried FOR MONTHS to verify my account to get their loan. I've lived in the same state my whole 47 years of life, & the same county for 23 years. They take a business week to turn around email requests. If you manage to get someone on the phone, they read off scripts and give you stock, unhelpful answers. Loan terms are ridiculous: 1) pay $20/mo for Plus; 2) Get a $500 loan - oh wait, now that you've got the loan, btw you only get $125 now, then pay us $900 over 2 years, then you get your other $375. So I paid off the $500 ASAP, and they waited 2 weeks to release the $375."
Hutton r,Awesome. Really helped me
christopher,"Would of been 5 stars i f I was told direct deposit takes 7 days,, now the check is waiting somewhere as I wait being broke"
Raymond Creech,Awesome service when your tight on a  budget and have a emergency expense pop up
patrice,help when I needed it
Christine,A really good app to use if you need a little bit of money for help.
elizabeth,It still like payday loans. Wont allow you get the 250 all at once but in $50 only the  you have to choose tip in every $50 and if you want money right away you pay 4.99 in $50.00. 😂
Lake,Easy I got cash immediately right when I needed it thank you
RHODESA M BAHL,"Very good to get quick money. However, the fees are pretty high plus the tips. You can only get $50 at a time so for $200 instantly to your debit card its $15 plus $6 in minimal tips."
dan,It's nice to know that if you get into a bind and come up short on cash moneylion has your back they deposited money into my account instantly thanks moneylion.
Tee Tee,It was perfect!

Rod Thomas,Awesome. Love it.
Chris Tilley,Awesome app super helpful when your struggling
customer,I've been with MoneyLion for a few months. I really like this company and it's pretty simple to get quick cash. Only down fall is asking for tips that I don't like. There's already a fee so why pay extra to tip. Especially if you need cash for something important.
Mike Smith,Agent could not answer my questions and then just closed the chat on me
jamie,Money Lion is the best. App is super easy to use and they spot you money in between pay checks to help you out!
Dennise Collum,"Money lion is pretty awesome if you ask me, but don't take my word for it find out for yourself"
Renee Vecchione,Love this app
ryan,In general the apartments are what you make them be. Management Ruled the apts as they see fit the way the lease is worded that way.Insread understanding how someone got in a situation.they ruled almost always by the lease forget understanding period. You want prison and fines go there.
gena,Good service
richard,I’ve emailed and asked for an extension on my repayment YESTERDAY! You’ve played your little game in delayed response so now I’m screwed in paying it back. Terrible customer service
donald,"I love it this is the best app out, they help you with everything that has to do with money"
Brittany Jones,Help is always available when neededThanks
Tracie Giustiniani,I have had nothing but an amazingly positive experience with MoneyLion....I don't have good  credit and they will lend you $500 no questions asked and no credit check....they also will let you borrow extra cash each month on top of that .....MoneyLION has been a life saver for me more than once!!!!... I truly reccomend it to anyone trying to repair credit and in need of cash quickly for an emergency etc.....
Corey,It's easy fast and very understandable.
Rosaura Chamorro,They are absolutely wonderful...always there when I need them in between pay periods👍
CC,"I just signed up today and so far everything is great. When you connect your bank account w Money Lion you can get up to 250 dollars that same day, or depending in how and when you want it, and then when your next pay day comes you pay it back, no interest charges, no fees. Next I'm going to sign up for direct deposit bc there are so many great resources that goes along with it. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."
prezshea,Sucks  real bad
Lekeisha Rhodes,Fhihkfhdnkhf

melinda,"It’s a great app. However, I do think that the $6 fee to get $50 is a bit much. If I was able to get more than $50 at a time it would be better"
Joseliz,"Excellent app for financially trying to get your... ""stuff"" together and be an adult."
Litisha Staten,Love MoneyLion wish everyone was getting this card it is so helpful with all the parties that help with financial support.

Joy Utterback Mimi,I had a great experience with them. They provide great service and even extend your payment day if you can not pay it on time. Worth a try.
katy,I love it money lion was fantastic it was so quick as soon as I put the button it was there like 3 seconds
customer,I have been satisfied so far I've been with Money lion for couple wks now.I would like to add something that has been an issue since the day after I 1st gave my review on moneylion I lost my password and requested a reset they sent me link after link time and time again and I even get confirmation that my profile been updated and password changed but when I try and log in I get the same error Everytime and can't log 8nto my damn account this is bull**** and I am not satisfied at all.

Russell Smith,This app is awesome. I was u able to get a simple payday lone from anywhere. Money lion help me dig myself out if a hole I was in and actually start a savings; so that I can have a nest egg and not end up back in that desperate situation ever again.
Chiquita Allen,I like the app and the service it provides but whenever I reach out to customer service I have to put a ticket in for them to reach back out. I'm told within 2 business days but today is the fifth day and no word from them even after entering another support ticket. Moneylion used to be way better. Will update when this is resolved

Jeri-Ann Hoffman,Always offering boost and has helped increase credit score
Eve,A good company to work with. Something different then a regular bank.
jd,"Money Lion was always a 5 star company since I started with in 2019. I have been a customer of money lion since 2019. During that time I borrowed from the credit builder plus loan several times and thankfully I have been able to pay off all the loans that I borrowed. The last loan I paid off I tried to re borrow it because I'm having a family emergency and I keep getting denied. I call customer service over the phone and I chat them online and they all tell me that they can't verify my income through my account or that my account isn't linked when I've linked it myself numerous times before reaching out to customer service. I feel like I'm getting the runaround every person I've talked to has given me a different reason as to why I can't borrow this loan. If the issue is my income, I get direct deposit.I receive $804 per week in income.  I'm constantly linking my account and all I'm getting is the run around."
william,Great app awesome
for your order,I love it when I need that extra to help me until payday moneylion is the best
sarah,Requested $100 but due to needing a new card I have only 78 available.
christine,Great App...will use again in the future 8f I need it
melissa,MoneyLion saved the day for me! I’m grateful and it was easygoing the whole process! This company allows me to borrow a few bucks before pay!Thanks MoneyLion❤️
Eduardo,Very easy to use abb
Gypsy Queen Karen,I requested a $50 advance and ir was on my card within minutes. And best yet my due date is the date I get paid.
Anonymous,Amounts could be better. But it will give an instant loan not hard
sherlonder,"Great app, super easy to use. The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is the 50 dollar limit. It’s kind of a gouge if you need more than 50 because you have to pay the fee every time. Other than that it’s great."
Jolene Crews,"This app is great. When you need a loan or cash, just ask!"
maria,I love how great this app is and does so much for your credit I love it so much!!
customer,Easy to borrow. Very helpful in an emergency situation.
Liz Ayers,Works great when in need of extra cash. Fast too!
Tina,It was easy. O would recommend 👌 to anyone
lakeita,I would totally give this 5 stars if you could take out $100 at a time instead of $50 or any number in that range.  It would make it much easier and would allow me to tip more and often.
Ed,Money lion is a true lifesaver. They always have my back.
frederick,Easy to work with and comes in clutch when in a pinch.
Kevin Gates,I have been a Money Lion member for 3yrs now. Seen then I have leaned how to invest and save very easy. And u can get a loan and build credit. I would recommend anyone who wants to have growth financial literacy
james,"I just wish you could cash out everything at once, and not separate."
Msshumpert,I pay for $4 for a fast transaction. That takes a long time. And you push us to give you a tip? What is up with that?
Steph Lee,Moneylion was great. Very easy to use and a great way t ol get money quickly when in need
chris,Customer service wasn't able to help me but they were very pleasant and advised me what to do!
Penny Huffman,Good service.  Ready to use
john,"The app does what it says, it's super easy to use."
Steven,Great app direct depoist was faster then any other
Kathleen Peterson,I love it. Very trustworthy
Rafael Alejandro Uribe Campos,I am just wanting to say that i have really enjoyed becoming a member of banking with MoneyLion simply because I feel like I have no unanswered questions for the first time with any previous bank. I would tell everyone to check them out. The rewards and the offers have been worth me changing over to be a customer for them and I encourage anyone else to follow.
denise,Great way to receive quick advances. However 4.99 turbo charge for immediate access is a lot then requires you to leave a tip. If you don't it will remind you to please leave a tip to keep using the services. Good thing is once you pay you're automatically eligible to get money back the same day.
lany,"Easy to use and the money get fast to the  bank account or to a card.   It help me to pay my bills on time to put food on my table, gas in my car and some Xtra for my enjoyment.  I highly recommend if you need cash fast"
brittany,Great app! Always helps me out when I'm in a bind. Highly recommend!!!
Wanda Lowery,Great when money is slim:) the date that it is due is nice because you can push it out if needed.
nahir,It came in handy in a pinch. Thanks again for everything!
Clark,Best app ever. Super user friendly and convenient with great incentives to use this app!
samuel,Great app when you're in need. It can start out low but i love the fact that it increases each time they get paid. Yes the fees are there and do add up but when in need you have to make a sacrifice. So if you're ever in need its a great place to start!
k “kt” thms,I have had to basically start fresh and build my credit back up.  MoneyLion is the best app I have come across.  It has helped me with my credit as well as the loans they give.  Not only do they keep reinventing there program to benefit me but they also give you tips about money.  The Instacash has been a lifesaver and there credit builder program is just what I need to build my credit.  Thank you for a great program.  I truly appreciate everything you guys have done for me😀
Harold Mosley,Clean place and fast service
a.,Great experience with them. Money is deposited quickly and easy to use.
Steven Thaden,App was easy to use and services and results were quick!!!
Ashley Perez,Love it 🥰 !!! The only thing I don’t like Is Win it says pay 3.99$ for faster delivery but then still take 24/48 hours to arrive. But other than that amazing 🤩
Carmen Y Moreno,"Solid banking, and lots of additional options. The banking app does feel a little bloated with some of the curated for you listings. Would be little better if The app home page was the accounts first so can see balance right away without having to change tabs but more just a  convenient thing. Would recommend"
Tynesha,"I found the process confusing at first, but I was able to use it for an advance which greatly helped"
ashley,Wow money lion is great 👍👍👍👍👍 business

Leilannah White,"MoneyLion has been a major savior! I am highly satisfied wth this banking app, can’t go wrong! Get it!"
Ryan Gunz,"Very easy sign up process with a decent advance amount available right away, they also increase advance max depending on repayment history if you're in need of extra funds. The biggest negative for me was the $50 increments for advances because you have to do so many individual transactions to cash out, I don't mind the tips but if you want it instantly $4.99 per $50 adds up fast"
Nicholas,It's a new feeling for me to have money late in the month. I owe my good fortune to moneylion and the practices I have implemented since being a member.
Kiesha,"So far, so good. Moneylion Instacash has performed flawlessly for me. It is going to be my primary backup for emergency cash."
lisa,I love Money Lion.  I get help when I need it.  Best advice I can give is make your payments on time and your borrowing power increases.
diane,Cash hits bank account within a few minutes.
Robert,Never have I ever thought that I would have to use any lenders or getting loans but times get hard at times and thank you to Money lion they have helped me so much in so many ways I am greatly appreciative. Thank you!

Eddie Lowther,"Great services, comes in hand when needing extra cash!"
Rebecca Herrick,I have used MoneyLion now for a few months & it is Awesome.  I have been able to get a few advances when we were low on money.  Because of MoneyLion I was able to get things we needed like simple basic groceries & even paying for brakes being replaced on our vehicle.  I have never had them take more than I owed or taken it before they were supposed to.  Everything has been right when it was expected to occur.  One of the BEST Apps of this kind I have found to date!! I would give it more than 5 stars if I could!!
Dana,I think you guys are great I had no problems at all I look forward to working with you

Steven,Very good gamei love it so much
Beth Tressler,"I was pleasantly surprised after dealing with the nightmares of other such companies prior to my Money lion/instacash adventure. Truly only takes a few short minutes. The App and program are very easy to use and understand. However I do wish it explained your immediate qualifying $ amt  and what your immediate options are. Stated I qualified for a 300$ insta ash loan, which I was in market for- yet it only gave me the option to select 50. It also appears to have many helpful ways you can participate and not only get more $ bWhile rebuilding your credit score. I'm looking forward to our continued working relationship."
lakeisha,Awesomegreat app got a loan and still request money it's amazing
Adrienne,Its good..................
nicole,Love there service. I use them as a primary bank for my personal not sure if they have a business account but if they do I will sign up!

diana,Great job they are doing
Raley,I love it. The only thing its that I would like to be able to deposit checks and cash.
D'Angelo Ledger,Essentially this is decent enough obviously for the consumer who still knows very little about finance and thus could ultimately educate the individual.However there are too many small dollar amounts that add up significantly to where as though there’s a bit of a pull on the small dollar loans.Also for instacash there should be a much better withdrawal set-up as the partial withdrawal makes tipping harder to do.Overall this is helpful if or when you may run low on cash for small expenses.
Veronica Woodall,This is an amazingly helpful app
Tim Hobbs,They are easy and quick to help me out and the fact that I can rely on them for funds is amazing
Nope nope,This is a very useful tool that helps get me through the tough times financially

Candyce,Raymond was amazing.  Even if he was not able to completely get my situation resolved as I wanted it he made me feel like money lying cares about its clients.
spyridoula,"Moneylion has been so great! From opening a checking account with them, to now owing shares in the stock market, Moneylion is not your average joe Bank. They go beyond average. Instacash has helped me make it until my next payday mulitple times now. I am so grateful I found Moneylion and I to anyone looking to open a new bank account be it checking, saving, money market, or crypto account I would highly advise choosing Moneylion."
Alana Keesler,Money lion is saying I owe them $365.  When I only received $200 from them.  I sent a text and this had never been resolved.

Briana Jenkins,Absolutely love them. Instacash is a blessing. Highly recommend anybody
Marquita “Kita” Williams,"I completely love MoneyLion! A really good way to view my finances, credit and the money you help with is definitely appreciated. Only thing is that I’ve been waiting for 22 days for my physical card and haven’t received a response as to will I be issued a new card or when I will receive it? I check the address and it’s all correct I’m just waiting for my card so then I can set up my direct deposit without worrying about only using the digital one I have on my wallet app. Anyways! Still love!"
ty,Just having a hard time with the loop holes with my direct deposit..they say they can't detect it and I am not eligible for and instacash . I receive ssa every month on the 1and 3rd this is not fair
Rochelle,Wonderful way of getting through some financially tight weeks.
Jessica J,This app is amazing. I worked my way up with them and when I need the extra cash it’s there
christian,Anyone with or without a responsible budgeting technique can benefit from this app. Instacash and loans available for any credit type. After years of utilizing this app I've never ran into any issues unless they were from my own negligence.

Michael Fitzsimmons,Great nice to have some financial help when needed

customer,Really came in handy when I needed sim extra cash
cheryl,MoneyLion is the worst of all you call customer destru dept asking for a Suoerviser they say ok we will have him call you back then you hear chicken in the background you ask when will I hear from the Suoerviser they say a day you wait a day 2 days you call again now a new so called agent tell you sorry give your number Ok have him call you back then you wait few days then then you call again and again they have no ticketing system where they can follow up on complaints there so called customer care each in a village over seas they have the sane access to customer data as much as the customer has they not bankers and have no solutions it’s all bunch of dummy’s with canned useless answers no solution whatsoever you request information about who is on charge I’m America no answer the amazing thing is once you explain your problem they forget it and loss

Brandi Nicole,It has helped a lot thank you enjoyedkdjdJdnxjxNxjxn
Benedict Ingram,There very good and are there when u need them the most
James Haney,"For the most part I love MoneyLion. What can definately be improved upon is the allotted timeframe given to repay loans, i.e. Instacash repayment. Meaning I entered all my pay information, and advised that I am paid ONE time a month, on the 24th, and am expected to repay instead on the 10th. I woudn't need an advance if I was paid before the date above."
Julia D. Weiss,"Very easy to sign up, Goy cash instantly"
Alterman Lawrence,They have been there when I get in a pinch
craig,Love this card
Donnie Crowe,I joined Money Lion after being sent a link I asked for funds and got it fast.

Cassandra Powell,Get service fast when u need it
jackson,It's a great place when your low on funds
Kimberly Clement,Phenomenal and amazing!  Why am I just finding this?
Damian Matrix-Gritte,Good and fast service
misty smith,"I previously wrote a positive review, however things have very much gone downhill since then, which is so frustrating because now I have to go through the hassle of finding a new bank! I’m in the market for a small business loan, and, trusting MoneyLion, I used the links listed in their “loans” section to choose providers. All but one was a link to a scam or spam, not actual lenders, but shady “middle man” type sites that ask for everything from your social to your bank account number, only to forward you to another “middle man” site. I went through the application process on one site only, that seemed ok, and I have been getting 20-30 spam emails since then. Apparently they sold my email address to advertisers. I am FURIOUS that MoneyLion would provide links to this type of thing. Obviously they can’t be trusted. So, as an alternative, I tried to apply for MoneyLion’s OWN loan program, the credit builder plus. My credit isn’t terrible, but could always be better. So why not? Because I can’t - why? BECAUSE I HAVE A MONEYLION ACCOUNT. I literally can not apply because my direct deposit and spending history is in a MoneyLion account, and they will only let you prove income banking history from an EXTERNAL bank. What in the world?? I called customer service to confirm this because it seemed absolutely insane, but was told point blank that I would need to open a new bank account, switch my direct deposit to that account, and then wait 60 days for the account to be considered “established” before I can apply for the loan. Something smells sketchy when they don’t trust their own accounts or their own members. So, off I go searching for a new account, AGAIN. The second star is because they used to be so awesome :("
Justin,Excellent good conversation
Charlene Gleason,Been great to have in a pinch and easy to use app.
smiles,"They are always there when I need them. The advances help me so much, and the card is an added bonus!"
Nature's Sunshine Training,Once again Money Lion disappoints. They cannot keep up with requests.I will be closing this account and writing a review everywhere. They will absolutely make you crazy. Done
Roderic Bain,They are wonderful I wish I could get more of a Advance than the $300 I wonder how I can do that other than that they’re wonderful and I appreciate the help they give me !!
Jaysin Fisher,"Why charge for instant access to money?!?? Earnin doesn’t charge 5 bucks, in fact that don’t ask or charge anything for direct access to the money….again earnin doesn’t have a turbo fee and you still get the money instantly"
D R McGriff,"I like it, it’s very helpful when you in need and gives you random boost"
andrew,Great app! Helped me out when I was low on money and it has helped me build my credit up!

lilgurl,Y'all do a great job with app appreciate it wish I could take more out but I'm thankful
leron,Easy! Life saver....
dawn,I am loving Money Lion. They make it easier to pay bills and friends when you have no way to physically do it. My credit score has gone up sense I started using the instacash part of Money Lion. The instacash feature also helps when a sudden experience pops up and you are strapped on money. Money Lion has other features that will help build up your credit and you can even invest with another feature. I recommend Money Lion to everyone looking for a bank that is there to help you grow financially.
Maggie Gradwell ,This app has gotten me out of some unexpected situations.
Brad,Na not a tv this time
William Moccia,Grateful they came through in just the nick of time for me with a higher limit than I expected
nerissa,This is just amazing!
Jacinta Toure',I'm new to the service as of today and so far I love it. I was able to pay my unexpected bill this morning.
bishop,I like the convenience of having a card for the instacash instead of transferring the money to my bank account and waiting. They offer other services when it comes to banking as well.
jake,The best out there. Nothing else like it thank you
Melinda Ortiz,"I love this app. Has helped me so much, not wit a loan but is helping me fix my credit"
Mardisa Cunningham,"I've been with Moneylion now right at a years time. And this far they've kept me happy also any barrowing from them from pay to pay is a real huge help at times. Thanks Moneylion, for seeing me through my financial needs when I've needed them ! It's a really big thing to me !! For people whom weren't brought up in families of a brother sister mother father setting, where are we to go-to in times of needs. Im sure im spesking for most folks also same being as to those whom have larger family for those who was just not asking for the help of others as auch, app's like Moneylion are, and do become like family to us i guess. Strang , but , true...So yeah A huge thank you Moneylion for being there for those of us in our times of need, & , simply being there for us like you shown thus far. You actually mean a lot evwn more than you know !! But,You could possibly be the very reason that someone made it into work that week and are reasons of them still holding on to their job being able too keep food on their table and their utilities kept going.. So for the little extra money you lend , you could possibly have turned a life arround for themselves. Like i said for some of us without you we woukd have none other ootiins periode. Speaking for many i believe..."
Ada Harris,Great app. Helps with your credit and saving money.
Kelli,Good but hard to get stared
kenneth,Money Lion has been and excellent bank and investment partner. Thank you
Justin intriago,It's quick easy and simple
Irvin l,"When I need help financially, it's there and it's easy...love this app.."
bruce,should be approved for more instacash.
steven,This app has proven to be most exceptional thus far.
Nina Scott,Moneylion was very deceiving with the Credit Builder Plus Loan. I have been a loyal customer for years I was having trouble with the app and had to cancel my membership. I went to sign back up but was told I couldn't because I didn't have an external bank.
adam,awesome card! ❤️😊
ellesse,IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU MIGHTNEED MONEY FAST 👍
travis,"Great company offering resources to raise credit, lend money in times of a bind, educate about importance of credit and financial readiness."
simone.j,Been great service
Benn Vasquez,Misleading and false information to get you to sign up
Freddy Thomas,MoneyLion is just a great way of banking and investing. They make things easy!
torrie,Thanks for the break down of i spend . Very pleased with it .
michael,Always there to help when needed
naomi,It really is fast and easy. The fee for getting the loan quickly ($4.99) is a little much compared to another app that I use but tips are optional and it still helps quite a bit to have a company offer quick and easy loans the way Moneylion does.
Brianne,U guys are the best thank you !! Never false always real💯💯
CMOJmomma,This might have problems but it comes in handy
Jerry Thompson,Moneylion came through at the right time. It's all in your control and they give you the tools to better your situation.  I'm just now trying to get things back on track!  Thanks Moneylion!
Zach Moran,Very helpful when you are in need. Good choice
earl,Love the app. User friendly and quick cash with little interest.
Lindsay,Money lion is awesome im so glad im a member they have loaned me funds when no one else would I will recommend them to family and friends
Chris Greek,I don’t like I can’t connect my roar account to be able to use credit builder
Maria,"I would say it was a good old bait-and-switch type deal but it came out where I still needed what they could give me. I was in a bind and it was already payday so I was trying to take advantage of their insta cash option and said I was approved for up to $300 and then another screen popped up I was using my smartphone by the way, and it said you discerned a $25 boost so I thought okay let me press $25 so once I did it only gave me $25 I was needing about 75 but the 25 helped kind of misleading on that"
denny,It is a good resource for getting money at a low cost and tipping is optional. I would recommend this to anyone just be ready to pay an ongoing fee for being able to use it when you need that extra cash to hold you over until you repay and start all over again.
Miguel Angel Pautt Cantillo,Great service to use in a bind. It really saved my Labor Day.
Heather Whitfield,"No because the tips I mean you it no interest. But hhe fee to get it is like 10%  unless you wait 3-5 business days but who used this app that doesn’t need it immediately, it seems under handed just like every other bank.   I do like the fact that it does work when you need it to though"
shanika,You guys were a great help.Thank you
keith,"Always fair, efficient and high value.Recommendation, everyone should be part of MoneyLion.Great financial assistance at unheard of interest rates. I especially love the 0%."
Monique,I afraid at first but they have proven me wrong. I give it 3 staars
dominique,Easy to use. Chat with live staff if you have any questions. They give you at least one to two weeks before the money has to paid back.
john tolliver,Solid app. Good for a little cash if your in a tight place. Would recommend for sure
ariana,Love it! Finally feel trusted.
tyler,Amazingly fast and easy to navigate
Shanna Love,There are a very good company and very easy to deal with
Leah Gonzalez,I love it! Super helpful when I’m low on money

samanntha,Very easy and very helpful when you need it .
Charlie B,Worked well for me.
jose garza,Came through at the right time
alfred,Excellent programI couldn't have been happier to find this.  It helps make it from paycheck to paycheck!
steven,I love moneylion !  They are very helpful!
ashley,GREAT app ..Help me get out of sticky situation
Bubba,Money lion is an awesome app would recommend to anyone
Richard Griffin IV,Great. It actually works
levern,"Everything is good except for the fact you can only request a loan of $50 at a time. And if you want it to go to your debit card the fee is $4.99. if you want it to go to your bank account it's free but can take up to 5 days. It just seems a little excessive for $50 and then on top of that they want a tip every time. Granted the tip is optional, but to have the choices be $2 or $5 or more is ridiculous over $50."
Young,This app is amazing and I am super glad I found it. They helped me out when I needed it. Thank you guys for that
Ashleigh Davis,Money lion has been a great place to go to if you need a little extra money until payday. It's easy to use and they offer other services too.I highly recommend them.
Conner,"Efficient, Swift… will use again as necessary."
customer,I need help with a fraud that happened in my account and I won't be getting help Intel the next day your guy fraud department should be available at all times
Rhonda Jackson,Thank you MoneyLion for being an assistance when you were needed.   Another door opened.

Chris Capicola,really wanted to build better credit i hope this all helps out efficiently much appreciated thanks money lion!
penny,Good and it helps me save money
bcr,Getting paid bi-weekly can be a struggle at times when you have 3 kids. When money got tight moneylion was there to help me out with money deposited into my bank account the same day within minutes
Jeremy Lege,The fees to access your money and don’t believe in your company asking for tips when you supposed to provide financial assistance temporarily doesn’t make since
Andrea Robison,I love the app
douglas bass,Money lion has saved me between checks several times
allan,Amazing app I love it and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in a amazing app for your banking account and It also helps you when your In need of a little cash advance payment
Tyler Edson,Great service is definitely recommend it to family and friends
lamar,Helps me out when I am in major need of money!
Shay,I was short on bills and the instacash option helped me out tremendously.
David Hall,Beware of Money Lion. I sent this email and no response.Why would you report my account as closed not paid? I paid this off in full and early.  1st it was horrible just paying off my loan early and now this. This is the worse company I have ever dealt with. You don't help anyone. SHAME ON YOU! You claim to report to credit bureaus. Then report correct information. I sent a complaint to BBB as well. Correct the wrong information.

essence,Need higher advancements more frequently!
Kathy Coumbes,Love it.. money lion has been awesome
K Gill,"This service has been beneficial in the past but I had a horrible experience last week. My payday was wrong in the system. I called to request to defer my due date by about 10 days. I was given a review # and told someone would follow up with me or I could call if I wanted to. I was assured the money wasn't going to be taken out. Fast forward 2 days later I haven't gotten a call but an email thanking me for my payment. The money I had in my account was for a tow, my car is not working so now I have to wait for my next paycheck. When I called customer service about the payment that I was assured was not going to be withdrawn, the review # was not attached to my account and they had no record of a payment deferral. Very disappointing and irritating to say the least."
krista,Super easy and super quick. Would definitely recommend
Amanda Vilander,"Aside from being double charged for the membership, moneylion is a great app...does need to work on the communication part better."
Bunky Brown,I'm trying to put more money on my card and can't because I have reached my limited... What is that BS...

Ryan L,It a wonderful app and it help if you need some extra cash though out the week or week!!! I recommend this app!!!
Charles,No complaints I just don’t like you have to pay $3.99 for each amount you take out that’s like $24 to borrow $235 plus you have to tip well not have to but I do! So if the fees were lower or if you could just take all at once would be good.
Ian Ellis,"I don't have any issues, always a great experience."
thomas,I'm unable to give a proper review since I am just signed on with Money Lion. I may be able to do so in the future

The Counslur,Thanks y'all
Michael Woodard,I do appreciate the help that I get from Moneylion. The app is user-friendly and works consistently well.
dean,"With student loans from nursing school, being a first-time father and homeowner, my pockets have been strapped down and i’ve been drowning. Money Lion isn’t playing game, and roaring on the completion for a reason. The advances are awesome. With I could get my advances in bigger portions rather than in $50 increments, but hyped about this app. Thank you"
Lisa,The Instacash advances come in handy when finds are low and the 0% interest is great because it doesn't cause more unnecessary debt.
Christopher Seaney,"Awesome , such a blessing !!!"
john,Comes through whenever I need it and building up your loan amount is so easy! Wouldn’t have been able to make it without this app! Just wish we could have more than $50 at a time

Claudia Smith,Works great. All ii needed to make the difference.
James Hodge,"The system is, in theory, a wonderful idea but if you need money from one place to another fast this is not your system. Transfers are slower then mailing letters. Haven’t seen any improvement to my credit yet but I’m still willing to give it a shot. Also customer care doesn’t exists, if you need to talk to someone good luck."
karissa,Fair repayment terms. Quick funding for emergencies.
Nikita,Automated and straight-forward. Just the way I like it.
Melissa,Quick and convenient sums your product up
kara,Really good app for when I need some cash right away to cover unexpected expenses or just need some extra cash!

Remy Red,I’ve always worked for what I needed and the last couple years I’ve been in bad shape having to go out on disability.waiting for one check a month that doesn’t even pay the rent how do they expect people to  live honestly .we were being evicted and my wife says to me at 230 am why don’t you try money lion-no food no toilet paper what did I have to lose- Hope is what I received!Thank YOU

Michael Goff,They were there when I needed them on a short notice
Spooked,"I love Money Lion, best service."
Dani Sayer,Can't add cash unless you use green dot would be better if you could just add cash at the ATM.
Karmen Ellis Abner,Been waiting on my card for weeks there's money taken out of my account that you speak into two different representative nothing's been done no report has been filed to get my money back there was a double payment taken out on my credit Builder loan they don't have a reason for that has been weeks of waiting for a new car nothing has been done about the money has been taken out of my account I've been done about a double payment because their system messed up and took out two payments on the same day for the same thing and no one has answers for me I'm going back to a regular bank that I can actually speak to someone in person

Consumer,Great company.  A life saver for the emergencies that happen.
Daniel Coleman,MoneyLion is a lifesaver with their interest free cash advances. Definitely recommend for when you're in a bind. My only complaint is that the app can sometimes be glitchy.
Ron,The app has been working great the only problem that I have with it is I accidentally picked the deposit into my account which takes anywhere between 1 and 7 days and there's no way to change it's so I can get it immediately on my card that would be something for you guys to work on thank you have a nice day
LaKeisha Potter,Absolutely easy to use has been a blessing in emergency

keyera,"Money lion offers advances, credit loans, and pays 2 days early. I love money lion. I yet to have a problem we with them."
Jdoendoen,Well I love how fast it gets to your bank account. But what I don't like is you tell them your pay day  is changed and they still take it on the day they always did when you have tried everything to tell them so.
JENNIFER,The fact that you cannot get the approved amount all at once is ridiculous. What's worse is being charged a separate fee each time you borrow. You could just say you charge a 10-11% fee for what you borrow but instead it feels like I'm being scammed. I appreciate the fact that I was able to borrow from you when I needed to. But it may very well be the last time.
kenneth,"moneylion is one of the best money loan app 👍 I apply and money hit my account fast and also the repayment is perfect, I love the way I repay my loan and a minute later I can get more cash advance back . I had other loans before and after I pay them back I had to wait like 3 to 4 days just to receive money back 😡 this is why I love moneylion cause I don’t have to wait a few days to get my money back #1 I will definitely Refer moneylion to my family and friends THANK YOU MONEYLION 😃👌"

I'm glad for the security, but it put me behind on bills and had to borrow money from my father.. I did not like that..."

BH,Great company there app is easy to use and services very understandable.
Tawara Ross,Honestly this apps ridiculous but I get it I need to the money lending. I don’t want any services with you guys please cancel any subscriptions I have with you. I want to pay you the money I borrowed and I’m done with you guys. How dare you guys ask for tip on top of a 5$ charge to get your money faster on top of borrowing by 50$ increments
Shawn Hall,"Was scared to get spammed by loan sharks because of another bad experience with another “cash boost app” giving my loan information to every shady loan company. However, money lion has a good rep as a banking system so I’m grateful to have it. It’s similar to Brigit, Dave, and Earnin, but money lion does have $5 fee per $50 for instant transfer. Brigit has no fees but only lets you have $140. Solo is cool if you need more cash but suggests 7% tip to the app and 7% to the individual loaning the money."
Travis Craycraft,"This is an UPDATE to my 1st Review - I was really loving and enjoying MoneyLion until recently they temporarily suspended my RoarMoney Checking Account due to a transfer that ""I"" made. I was transferring money to a relative that was in dire need. They did this for Security reasons. I understand that but what I don't understand is why they could not be like other Banks that send you a text or email and ask ""Did you make this transaction?"" instead of immediately suspending it. I had to fax them a copy of my Driver's License and a Billing Statement showing my proof of Address. I did this a few weeks ago. The first time I emailed it to them, I found out their Customer Service gave me the incorrect Email Address. The second time I emailed it to the correct Email Address was last Tuesday, 8/24 and until today 8/30 my account is still suspended and I can't even access my own paycheck that was directly deposited on Wed, 8/25, which is very unfair. I have bills to pay and I can't pay back my InstaCash due to this and MoneyLion is saying I am late. I would not have been late if they had not suspended my account for making a transfer on it. It was me and their process is ridiculous. I was a very pleased Customer until this happened. I can't buy food or groceries, I am starving right now. Thanks MoneyLion."
Shontaa lphillips,I've been banking with these guys for years and have never had an issue... EVER!!!
Richard A.,"I had a great experience getting money stolen from Moneylion LLC, just like all the other customers."

Tyriek Colston,Good and reliable
Emily Flessas,"Quick, easy cash in time of need. I would recommend moneylion to everyone."
cris,Good company and alwaysgot your back when you're down and out
nancy,"One of the best, I should have given 5 star but I don't like the fact that you have to access your loan in pieces with the highest amount of 50 dollars. I understand that's for business reason but at least it should be considerate and make it 100 dollars max for each request and not 50. My maximum is about 350 but I have to request 7 times and pay transfer fee of 4.99 each time. This will be the only issue why I will look elsewhere."
Zakeeyaw Lyons,I love this app. Very helpful when you are in a bind.
Brenda E.,Great payday advance loan app. Highly recommend!
Mary Crossen,Simple to use. Lives up to claim instacash
squad leader,Money Lion is more then a online bank but a well thought out tool that I enjoy using.
shelby,"This company has help many times, sometimes when in still a little short will increase the rate and come threw in the clutch"
Sam,Pretty straightforward and awesome! Highly recommend!!
jonathan,"Do not bank with this company ever since I signed up with ML, they sold my phone number to third party scammers, I get called 20+ times a day, I now have to change my number, they made unauthorized purchases on my Debit Card which caused my bank to close my account. Not only that the sold my home address and social Security Number. So now my mailbox is full of spam and who knows what my SSN is being used for. I have to get all new information and this completely SUCKS."
Janicia,Moneylion totally sucks. Worst bank ever. They can't ever tell you anything because nobody ever knows anything and you pay for a set amount of certainty and yet they still never can answer any question you have. I hate them.
Tonneysha Reese,Money lion is a great app. If you reading this go download it now. Its a one stop shop for all your money needs.
Tasha,Amazing app always available to lend a helping hand.
Brandi Cronk,"Money Lion continues to be my go to place for financial news, small loans and savings. Upfront fees. Please tip as this continues to help the community and pay it forward."
tia,They only let you borrow up to $50 at a time so they can get you on an optional tip of up to $5 or more and then if you want the money now they have a turbo option for $3.99 so by the time they hook you up with this 0% APR Instacash it costs you a bunch.
Chioma,When you have been searching for any type of emergency help it is always credit check sorry we can’t help or outstanding fee then here come this company with no questions ask help people get by for any emergency in a instant!!! They trust and invest in people and I love it !!! If I can give them a million stars I will do it !! Thank you for believing and trusting in people like me !!!

cory,"I think that money Lion is quick reliable and safe. Its a great way to help rebuild your credit as well as get extra funds.I totally recommend money lion,"
randall,The payback for the insta cash shouldn't be so much and it shouldn't automatically take it out of your bank  because not everyone can pay it back all one shot deal because some people need that last 40 bucks to pay for their mom's meds or pay their rent.
Fran Pepe,Awesome company. Haven't had any problems in the 6 months I have been banking with them.

christina,"I have been waiting for over a week for a ticket to be resolved over my credit builder loan that I have never missed a payment on but says I have due to my 4 year old accidentally pushing the pay off button. and it now has my instacash disabled that my family uses greatly since we just had our baby boy a month a half early. I called when I said what happened a immediately and customer service said they would submit a ticket stating the accident and have it put back on to my regular payments and it would open up my instacash again. But  a week later when my deposit hit they took the full amount of what I owed for instacash which is fine but my instacash wasnt reopened cause they still hadnt fixed the problem the credit builder loan payments.  Meaning my family doesnt have the extra funds that may be required from time to time for no fault of my own. I called support again today and of course they said there was still no response about the ticket and that maybe I should call back next wenesday and they couldnt open my instacash again until they fixed the error. I have been with money lion for several years now and I have never missed any payments whether its membership fees instacash repayments or credit builder loan payments. I have a steady income deposited every two weeks. and even stuck it out when they apparently issued my account number to someone else also (this is exactly what the representative told me) and they stole over 700 everything my family had at places in India.) and it took money lion weeks to issue credit for the clearly stolen money. Ive stuck it out when customer representatives have been rude and hung up on me, and refused to help with issues. Ive always been greatly appreciative of the services offered by money lion. But their timing it takes to respond to support tickets that can greatly effect their customers ability to pay their bills and feed their children. Please fix this soon. My payments are not missed and I have been a loyal customer for years."

Once i linked my checking account & had my info reviewed they gave me $50 instash which is basically a 0 % advance on your paycheck. There are task & referral boost/increases you can get. I'm already up to $100 just for paying back the 2 advances I got. I also really like their website. It's very user friendly. I even opened a savings type account to participate in shake and bank. Use your money roar account for $10 or more & you shake to get part of your money back routed to your savings. So fun.

Karen Gamez Gutierrez,It’s okay. I don’t like the fact that I hook my bank account and I go to insta cash and you guys want me to pay a couple days before I get paid and I can’t change the date. When I transfer money from roar account to my bank account it should not take 4 days. Need to raise the amount to at least 100 insta cash instead of 50 at a time. I mean doing multiple 50 dollar transactions with boost adds up kind of a scam. Yes you have help in a pinch but I want this app to work I enjoy it and it’s very educational for me. Please update these features. My company doesn’t have direct deposit but you have my bank statements and all that so why can’t I do some functions as if I did??
Colleen Mercer,I am confused as to why my online bank is ok to deposit loans but is not acceptable for other programs within the app and cannot instantly transfer to the debit card from my online bank. I use the most popular (According to surveys) online bank on the web but they are not accepted. Moneylions programs are interesting just make sure your banking method whatever it is gets accepted
Darkise Thomas,it works sometimes be careful tho
Baylei Williams,Got a decent advance for my first time. Just don't like the fact you can only request 50 at a time with a 4$ transfer fee. It's nice to offer 160 but using that will cost me 16$+tips
Lawanda Zanders,They are always there when I need them
Anthony Villaloboz,Great product. Great experience. Lots of ways to build credit and their system really makes it easy to save. Easy investing system. Easy transfer system. Borrow up to 300 every check if you need. Setting up direct deposit is fine but the system doesn't recognize that I have it set up for direct deposit so it tells me to even though I did already. Give it a try and you will see how greatoney lion is! I only keep my Huntington to have a physical bank.
CARLOS Vick,Awesome try them out!!!!!!!!!!!
Gary Wallace ,This app was true to their word. It was fast and easy.
ssscott,Some issues but quick to fix
Kimberly Melton,I wasn't allowed to receive my max on instacash even though I qualify
cory,Money lion is the best choice I’ve ever made.
Aaron,Very Helpful love it ‼️
Nicol,Money lion has been the worst financial institution ive ever done business with their Representatives need more training their financial vendor meta bank is not recognized or accepted by any other institutions so you cant get any other type of service or link money lion with any service and moneylion is not credited or recommended by the Better Business Bureau. They manipulate you into a loan that you pay interest on but cant even use it until you pay it off which is your own money that you get but only when you pay it off until then you cant touch the money.. its twisted you pay them to borrow your own money and then it dont even help with your credit score..
James,Money Lion has been a great addition to my financial planning and budgeting. I've had 3 loans with them and boosted instacash. The availability has also gotten better from my initial membership until now. I'm very pleased with the service.
Timika L Jackson,Very fast and helpful whenever they can.
kimberly,This is awful I can't even put my money on my debit card it's supposed to go to my bank account!
ANDRYAN,Ways to help you with your credit and also you can borrow money that is awesome

Keithin.R,love it!!! best financial app around!!!
cheryl,I have really enjoyed my Moneyloin checking account along with the app. I didn't realize I was wasting so much money going out to dinners & this app has been a blessing in disgues. It'd extremely easy to use and I also love the reward feature.  Anyone that is struggling with trying to get your finance together needs this app I highly recommend it!
kenya,Great customer service and app is rather easy to commute while learning about your credit
Katrina Johnson,"Moneylion has been great! The instacash option is my favorite thing about this app. Other apps start you off with less than $100 and will only raise the amount if you choose the direct deposit option but with Moneylion, I'm able to borrow over $200 without direct deposit and up to $1000 if I choose direct deposit ! I just wish I could utilize the credit builder plus option but my bank isn't on the list. Please add chime to the list of banks?! It is an online bank and it operates through a bank which is on the list, but I still can't add my chime account. I still give moneylion 5 stars because it is an awesome app with great features but if chime were on the list of banks and I could sign up for credit builder plus, this app would be a solid 10 stars, hands down!!!"
michael,The definition of exactly what a pay advance loan app should be! It has never let me down and is my go to pay advance app 110% everytime! Never disappoints. Definitely earned a 🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘 from me👌🤑💸
Abdul,Fast and efficient. Very helpful.
Jamey,Great service when I was in need
Emily Beal,Love them. Would use them all the time.
colin,"MoneyLion is one of THE BEST, if not THE BEST company for financial planning. This company offers a wide variety of financial services such as credit score monitoring, cash advances, loan resources, and tips to help increase your credit score, as well as, useful information to stay on track towards financial peace and freedom. In my opinion, MoneyLion has every financial tool imaginable, all in one place. Thank you MoneyLion for servicing myself and my family! God Bless!"
Marycute,"MoneyLion is by far the best money management app I've ever used. They really come in handy for all of their options they offer. Jump on in, it's a great place for financial jump start as well as longevity!"
danny,Great app good foundation for credit improvement
brian,Must I be honest I have been using roar money/monet lion  for a while now. i am well pleased with everything this bank has to offer. They not only teach you how to invest they invest in you.
Louis Sierra,Very helpful customer service representatives they know how to treat their members
Chris Wallis,Been using it for a while now and haven't had any issues
kadonna,Freagreat app
YFB “Vion” Vio,So far so good just started so still learning the app and will have to start using the other tools which is good for all credit types only problem I have to figure why they haven't identified my paycheck not sure how to get support got a 50 dollar advance because my credit acts are in good standing I think this is going to be awesome app and need to figure how to change due date because it didn't line up with my payday but that's my fault I'll shut great app so far
michelle,"To be honest, I reviewed the experience a (3) because I was made promises of what would happen and how my situation WOULD BE resolved. At this point, I don’t have much to say. I look forward to them making good on representations and following through. I will update, when there is a resolution."
Jeremy Cummins,"MoneyLion has gotten me out of 3 small money emergencies so far. Although, I am unable to get $300 at one time because I don't get direct deposit, through the micro-loans I've done with instacash, I was able to earn enough reward to get $75 at a time. Thank you for helping me when I'm in a pickle!"
angela,It’s a great app and great financial institu helps get thru the hard days well recommended five stars and great customer service they have
lydia,I'm just getting started. Thanks for the instant cash advance.
kristin,I was able to pull money needed for an advance fast and easy. Hassle free and secured platform. I’m glad I was able to use this when needed.
mae,Awesome I love them and refer them to everyone
Angela J,Love It. Gives me a lot of great information plus advances when I need a little extra cash
patrick,This App comes in handy when times of short on cash occurs. I have been a money lion member for over 3 months and I haven't had a problem getting the cash I need yet.
phillip tanner,Moneylion is a great source of extra money...It gives the ability to choose the amount of money you need. Moneylion also gives you an overview of how much you can receive.

William Fatino,"Great service, always has my back. I'll use them forever."
Gregg Solomon,Amazing. App very useful
justin,I'd like how the app works and only thing is that I wish that it gave more of an advance
Crystal Young,Life saver easy to use
Brandi,This is honestly the worst experience I have ever had with a financial institution or customer service issue of any kind. I have been waiting three weeks for a resolution to an issue that no one seems to be able to solve. I tried to switch my direct deposit over using their app and they somehow put in my account numbers wrong to their own account and then blamed me for it. I highly suggest anyone and everyone to stay FAR FAR away from Money Lion in order to protect your money!!
Nina Parham,Moneylion always has my back when I have to borrow instacash from them and when i have to  Defer my payment they  always accommodate me there a very good  company Best on the market and best Customer Service as well.
William Gawron,Thank y'all so much I love how y'all can help
Mya,"Misleading. Reporting to all the regulatory offices possible. First says I can get up to $300 in insta cash, then next screen says $170, then they make you ask for it in $50 increments with a $4.99 fee for each one to be instant. They advertise o% apr but are making a killing by these set up. Will pay off when paid in 4 days and never use this service again."
Cynthia Mcgowan,Great app that always helps in difficult times
Tonisha J,"So fast,easy and simple was approved for $120 through the instacash.. Love MoneyLion app"
danny,Good app to use when you are low on money
J. Baez,NEW FEATURES SUCH AS PAY OVER TIME AND MY MOST USED FEATURE IS INSTA CASH MONEYLION IS ON POINT!!! JUST NEEDS A TRANSFER MONEYLION TO MONEYLION AND PENDING DEPOSITS.

adriane,Still waiting for them to close my loan that I paid off two weeks ago.
Courtney,MoneyLion has everything all the competition has plus more!I received a $500 personal loan and I have poor credit.5 Star online banking
Patrick O,"Not the bank they promised when they started. They opened saying they were a easy bank that was about the customer. In truth they seemed to be that but with each year all those promises went away. All those programs changed or were no longer offered. It was a typical bait and switch. Besides the bait and switch the fact customer service is impossible to get hold off is my biggest complaint. They lie and it's the simple truth. When you wait at least 2 hrs to speak with a person, by the way never do the call back feature it never happens, but when you reach a person they will say they are opening a case. They say they will be in touch when the area expert looks into the issue. Well sometimes 5 minutes later or 2 days later or two weeks later it's always the same. You get an email saying the case is closed. When you call And wait 2+ hrs again they tell you the case was closed because they weren't able to reach you for help on the issue. The funny thing is they can send a ""closed"" email about the case but you never receive a call or email about the actual problem. It's brutal and always a B's way to close a case they had zero intention to actually try and resolved. Just not the bank it once was, gain typical bait and switch."
Sabrina Becton,Always there when I need them most! Thanks moneylion.
Larry ,"There when you really need it, able to rock on with it instacash  has ya back"
Jerry Lee,Such a easy and effortless app. To many pros to mention. They have helped me with my everyday life and make things so easy. Thank you for your help

r.s.,I'm very pleased with the money lion app. it comes in handy when I'm in a pinch financially.
Joyce ,Great app. Helps when you need it
james,Great app good for building your credit not !!! they are complete rip-offs u pay the credit builder plus loan and then u suppose to get the rest of the money from your loan and the only give u 10 bucks I don't recommend anyone to use them ..??
customer,"Been banking with Moneylion, since they were Moneylion, now known as RoarMoney. All experiences have been well. I've only got one small pet peeve within the system, that when they notify you of declined transactions, they do not provide information as to what the transaction was, if they could fix that little issue, they'd be perfect."
sheba,What can I say you guys are awesome I actually had to pay back my last loan a little late and you didn't hold it against me
Danny R Grant,"Instant money whenever you need it, anytime any day.. it can't be beat!!"
Jacqueline,Thank you for having my back Money Lion  when I am in need of help the same way a Lion has another Lions back in their pride in the jungle.  Thanks again!!PS:  ROAAAAARRRRRR!!! 🦁

Ratherio Velez,MoneyLion is awesome!!! I would rate it ten stars if possible! They have come through for me in a crunch so many times!! No other app is close!
Brooks Mclain,I like money lion a lot. My only problem is the App. Its super slow. Dont matter if on Wi-Fi or data or what device u use. Its slow. Wait forever to load. Put in pin or finger print then wait some more.
Donnie,Great to have
Mary,Great app once you've qualified no cool off period.
zOmBiE,Sucks you don’t connect to chime but y’all alright with me
Terita Russell,Great Great great... that all I can say about this app. Nothing but positive experience with the app. The customer representatives are also easy to get a hold of.
desire,"Great app. It helps in times of need and I upload a portion of my check out of good faith just keep it progressing. Tons of useful tools as well, so go ahead and try it!!!!!"
Jessica,This app is great and always there to save me when money gets tight.
tanisha,It has been a very good experience so far with money line I will refer them to anyone
Teresa Warren,MoneyLion markets to those who are struggling to make ends meet. I fell victim to the credit builder loan which cost a high apr ≈17% and then they charge you a weekly fee to keep the credit builder plus account which increases the apr drastically. Not to mention my financial illiteracy led me to sign up for multiple of these loans and I now have too many inquiries to get a credit card. If it markets to financially struggling people it should also educate them on their actions.
Brandi Gray,MoneyLion has saved the day again. I am so grateful for that. However the only thing I don't like is how my due date never aligns with my payday. I wish there was a away that I could reset the due date. I literally get paid on the same day every month.
Melanie Gurnick,I love using the insta cash.  It helps out big time.
kyle,I love Moneylion try it and you will too.
Tonya Perez,Great app. Offers financial services that come in handy. Would recommend.

Natasha,"Moneylion is helpful in pinch before payday!!They also offer information on the stockmarket, help you invest,  offer budgeting advice. They have credit building programs. You do have to meet criteria to get the payday advance but it's not hard."

LaShuna,Great service! Thanks!
caitlin,"Money line contacted me on Instagram and informed me that I could I had won $1,000 and that for me to get the bonus I had to put a $300 or $400 on my account and well when I put the money on my account they did not follow through with the $1,000 that I have one or the $1,000 bonus also they had taken all the money off my account and now my account is only got 53 cents on it and I have no money in my account so yeah I definitely would give them a rating of one. And I know that it possibly could have been a legit because they was contacting me by email from the money line email address and contacting me by Instagram or Twitter on messaging on instant messaging and it's on their money line Incorporated account so I don't understand the problem or why they had to take all of my money but I definitely will not bank with them and I will get the word out to whoever I can!"
gaige,Excellent services will be sticking with them for a while
Monica Booker,So far this app has helped me out s lot. Pay day advance if you need it. A way to start investing. The ability to track your credit score all in the same place.
Omar Sandoval,"Instacash is fast and convenient. The ability to invest a few dollars at a time is nice for a beginner, the app works well and customer support has been helpful when having questions."
Nikko,"Is so easy, excellent service, great app."

kp,Great I love money Lion
stephanie,"I signed up for this app PROVIDING MY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER under the promise that I would be able to borrow $250.  After it was all said and done, I was only given $25 to borrow.  This is a scam."
alayna,"Money lion is a really good online banking tool. The trust they have on cash advances before even knowing you as a member is remarkable. The opportunities from investing, watching what you spend, and all the different loans that get approve without judging you off your credit is or might be the best there is out there. Along with having really good opportunities, they offer one of the best direct deposits by offering more ways to put money in your pocket. Thanks money lion!"
Jen webb,already started helping my credit and saved my ass a few times
robin,good app love it
danielle,They force you to “ tip “ and then charge 5.00 to have the money the same day . So your basically paying them back double interest and tip .
karen,I love this app! Comes through exactly when I need it in point and instant! Never regret getting it
Misha Green,Money lion is awesome.  There when I need them with a few $$ but also helpful ways to help get educated and make more $$ of my own.  Love them!

So after careful consideration I have to say why didn't I do this a long time ago? BEST ONLINE BANKING EVER!!! PLEASE GIVE IT A TRY THEY HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS YOU GET DISCOUNTS, YOU CAN BORROW MONEY AND PAY IT BACK WHEN YOU GET PAID, THEY ALSO HAVE WAYS OF GETTING DISCOUNTS AND NOT JUST ONE OR TWO SEVERAL DISCOUNTS THEY ALSO HAVE THE SHAKING BANK WHERE YOU GET MONEY EVERY TIME YOU USE YOUR CARD YOU SHAKE YOUR PHONE AND YOU GET MONEY!!!

Rosco,They're are always there when you need them. They care about their customers.
Enrique Santiago,"I have not many problems whatsoever with it, it’s been great so far. However only situation or issue I’ve encountered is not being able to pull cash out the ATM on a few diff occasions. Would read “no issuer found” or “cannot connect to issuer server” then of course the ads or constant spam/ad emails upon looking into ceretain services they provide within the app."
cesar,Very good never have a problem
Nature&sounds,Excellent reliable banking app that allows me to invest without the hassle.
David Lopes,Money Lion is a easy bank with fair offerings.
joseph,Love this app came in clutch a couple of times
Hannah,"The cash advance limit was not fixed, and I never got a call back. I was promised a 1000$ cash advance limit and it was yanked away at $625. I was saving the rest for fuel funding for a ministry trip, but if this is not resolved in at the end of the business day, and I am not called back, I am changing my monthly direct deposit to another bank, I will only have lower advances, but not promised something that would be taken away. And as far as paying off the advance, I will do that in short payments I can afford to avoid collections. A little more information on this, my monthly direct deposit is close to $3600 a month. That is plenty for a $1000 cash advance limit."
Natasha Owens,So simple and easy to use!! Great customer service!!
Bobbi Marie,Absolutely fabulous service. Easy to use and understand. Very helpful in my time of need even able to pick date to repay.
Marian Welch,As long as you qualify for instacash it's very nice and fast option for instant cash advance that's also 0% APR. Depending on your financial history as they say and good standing you can request whatever amount  posted available. It starts at 25 and they work you up and of course making all repayments all on time gets you boosted after making 3 or 4 payments. This is only service I could find to be approved for any cash advance since my banking history show enough proof of good standing. If can't make a payment on time then just submit a contact request for the new date to pay and if they grant it your good!
Sandra Johnson,Its over all pretty  good but the customer  service  can never help u they ste always  confused
miranda,This is the absolute best app ever for borrowing money and banking. Will recommend to everyone I know!
Deavin Sessom,This program is an excellent way to build credit and save.
Cherise Jones,Great company. Very helpfull
jess,Great app that helps with financial goals.
Melinda Booth,Very easy to use only issue is I wish you could take out more then 50 dollars out at a time from the boost and then pay 5 dollars the get it right away really adds up if you need more then 50 out
Carla,Always there when I need extra funds!
katrina,Great and convenient
Veronica Gonzalez,My instacash cash was finally fixed as of aug 9th I went to look this morning august 10th to find out it's back to the same status of direct deposit not being detected. I'm so frustrated.... I've been so patient and now it's completely unexceptable. What's going money lion? I really like this program but what's the issue?? Please address and I'll happily change my 1 star rating to the 5 star rating your company deserves. Thanks
Cody Hall,I love it it's awesome

eleni,I have to give money line to five so far money line has been able to not only help me with cash advances when needed but as also giving me the ability to keep better track of finances that were more difficult to keep up with
David,Not only has the credit builder plus helped boost my scores over a course of 3+years but it always pulls through when I need cash quick. Only thing I hate is only being able to request $50 at a time of instacash even though 200 is available to you. Other than that I love it

semone,The Instacash feature is great WHEN Money Lion doesn't make you pay multiple payments instead of one payment all at once and Money Lion does not explain very well their website or app. Too much trial and lots of errors which can be very costly to the customer.
cristina,"Money Lion was able to offer me a way to build my credit when I really needed it. They also have instacash available if you’re running low between paychecks. I have a stock account with them, and it’s actually making money! They always seem so nice and so helpful. I feel like they have my best interest in mind."
Tiffany Adcock,Great service. Help in times of need
sharon,"Been using this app for a few years now. Never any problems. Pretty straightforward with a couple features i really like, roundup and instacash.Roundup rounds every purchase up to the nearest dollar and deposits that amount in a designated account. I'm horrible at saving and this makes it invisible to me (mostly).Instacash is their payday loan feature. No interest. Very convenient. One thing they did which i DON'T LIKE is limit transfers to $50. So say i qualify for 200 instacash, now i can only get at it in $50 chunks. And if i want that $50 chunk instantly (of course i do), then i have to pay the associated fee. And if i want 100 at once, that'll be 2 separate transactions. Each with their own fee."
Jen Haire,I love it it’s great works great and the cards they give are nice looking as well
william,I absolutely love moneylion it has given me the opportunity to save save money investment money and even raise my credit my credit has went up almost a 100 points in the se points in the 6 months that I've had this app.
veronica,Wish you could request all your Instacash limit at once instead of in $50 increments because you'll pay anywhere from $4-12 for each 50 you take and that really adds up quick. Other than that I like it a lot. Lots of good information and options.
wendy,Great.       .....
Amanda Harb,I like how user friendly this app is .and how quickly money is in my acct.
Melanie,I have fallen in love with this app it makes investing easy and gives great ways to earn cash back. Investing my cash back has become an easy way to save and invest in well known investments creating a little nest egg.
brian,"Great customer service , contacted me directly with issues I had and helped me"
Ikarus Narel,Money when you need it but limited to max $50 at a time. Cost with tips and direct deposit comparable to P D advances.
The Great Curt,The instant is way to much especially when I need 100 it’s 10 bucks plus you want a tip. Othervv by than that the convenience is awesomeness.

I went to 3 different places that are listed as part of the network for greendot at the register or whatever and none of them would allow me to add cash to my card. Still unsure as to why it wouldn’t work…."
Dusty Dawn Harrison,I love money lion.  As a single mother of 3 and living check to check this app has helped me greatly get extra cash until my next payday so I know I can afford everything I need for myself and children until myNext check.  And the great part is they take it out of my check as soon as I get paid so I don’t have to remember to pay them back so I’m not worried about missing a payment.  I highly recommend this app for anyone who needs a little help extending their payday.

Mel,"There are lots of payday loan companies out there that take advantage of today's environment. This is not one of those companies. It does take some self discipline. Don't borrow more than you can afford to pay back. Also if you don't need instacash, instantly you can have sent to your bank account for free in a few business days. They also have several other credit score and savings options. I definitely recommend this app."

Robin Johnson,I am having a great time with Moneylion I trust him with my funds they have been nothing but excellent in handling my affairs remind me of my bills and keeping me up-to-date on my credit situation is a great experience in anybody would be a fool not to have this app
maria,"Money Lion is truly a pioneer especially in the industry they're in, to loan money to a person like myself who has had some financial mishaps and sub-par credit scores during my membership with the Instacash funding source while and is truly unique to the brand alone.  They literally strip it back down to basics and believe that if you're generating an income of some sorts you should be entitled to a small-sizeable advance and that's on the basis of trust, honesty and hard work.  Those are morals you'll see across the board on the MoneyLion app as they have essentially become a better way of banking for ""the people"" and I just find that very reputable,  rather convenient and ultimately the type of financial institution I want to do future business with.  Strong Morals, Education,  one of a kind tools and resources all continue to assist in my interest and bond with the company an it sort of becomes a scenario after actively seeing the way MoneyLion interacts with their customer base where you're both finding one another united in these struggles together,  you're experiences of the good times are also joined side by side with them the whole way through, for better or worse and after all isn't that the way its suppose to truly be?"
jeffery,I love this app. Came in handy so many times between paychecks. Absolutely worth having for emergencies. I highly recommend this app.
Michelle,"They are there, when you need them ."
GeorW,Awesome transaction! Smooth and Quick! Exactly when I needed it!

miranda,Very fast and helpful when u most need it! Very satisfied!
dillon,"MoneyLion may not have commercials on TV to tell you how good they are, but as far as I'm concerned they don't need to.  They let their available services and their customer service speak for them.  You don't have to be on hold for an hour either."
taquana,Money lion is a very useful app and it really helps you out when you get low on money  and won't receive any more until the next pay day  it helps me get by until my next paycheck
ikemefula,"Excellent, right time when you need it"

Robert Thorne,It’s great gave me money when I needed it!
john,Very helpful
taj,Great app to use for quick money
Lexa,Greatest app for money and credit rebuilding I have ever found.  You can build a loan or get cash before pay day at extremely low costs.  You can also shop loans on the internet.  I highly recommend if your rebuilding credit or you get cash strapped before pay day then you should get this app on your phone.
P.R.,Money Lion really helped me out. I was in a bind n needed money ASAP for an emergency n they made it happen. I love their service I just wish I could've requested the whole advance instead of $50 but still good service would recommend.

audrey,This app is really convenient when i need money right before payday.
david,This the best app.
barbara,I love moneylion I have been with them for 2years never had any issues plus they are helping me build my credit!
chris,"Well, this app/bank is good for somethings like helping you get your credit in order...instacash is good when you need it. But when something makes a mistake in the system...it is algorithms that cause issues sometimes and cannot be easily changed or fixed manually. I had an issue with this...it took a while to get solved...but the issue got solved nonetheless. I was happy with that. I still use the app."
zachary,"Helpful, quick and trustworthy service"

Melissa Mcferron,Money lion is a great company they noticed unusual spending and immediately put a freeze on account. The spending was actually me but was great to know they paid that kind of attention to my account
rachel,"I like the features of money lion, however money lion never responds to customer service requests or anything that you send to them. I filled out a submission form to have my repayment date for instacash changed (Over 7 days in advance) because they have my paycheck date incorrect. I never once heard from MoneyLion regarding any issue and to put the icing on the cake, they charged my bank account for repayment and put it in overdraft and screwed me over out of an additional 50$ in overdraft fees. To top that off even further, money lion asks for a “tip” for service that is a joke."
Anna Brown,Nothing much to say. Expect I would prefer my due dates to be changed back to Friday and not Wednesday.
ronnie,It was good and it is really really helpful
Wayne Green,"Money in minutes, sometimes seconds without the worry!"
Destinee,"Thank you so much Moneylion, it is always nice to know I can trust you to get me out of a financial jam. You really help to alleviate my stress from my life with just the thought of knowing instacash is there when I need it,And the app/accounts is so helpful with managing my finances."

brian,Ive got nothing bu positive input on Money Lion. With the unexpected times ive had financial emargencies occur and being paid biweekly can be rough when unexpected expences occur. It is so easy to advance off my upcoming payroll and pay it back. It is super convinient and user friendly. I appreciate all the help ive recieved.

ronald,Such a great app to work with your credit
vernon,Wonderful app!! Love it!!
TJ,"Absolutely one of the best apps for someone who wants to get their crap together and kinda understand it all.     I understand less than nothing when it comes to investing in stocks, with this app I don't have to all the work is done for me. I put money in and it grows or I lose a little but it seems to balance out.     The only issue I am having is not being able to get approved for the credit builder services. I have all the criteria required in theory I definitely should be approved however I am denied every time."
Jason Slough,Pretty useful when you're low on cash but $4.99 fee to expedite delivery of cash is a lot especially if you're only taking $20-$30. Plus it would be helpful if you're able to take a bit more out in one shot instead of doing it a few times in order to get the amount you need. Other than that I'd recommend it if you need cash in a pinch.
jessica,Money lion is a life saver. Their instacash feature helps me in tough situations and they extend the repayment date if it’s too close to the fate you requested the instacash. Their credit builder loan has also improved my credit tremendously.
lawrence,I love this company! So kind and professional 10 thumbs up! Blessings to you all!
danielle,App is very easy and straight forward.  Was simple to sign up.
Nee,I have been a member for years and MoneyLion has been really reliable and great for investing. I would recommend them to anybody.
laquinta,It's always worked for me and when I didn't have the money to pay for it on time they gave me more time to get paid. It's a great app to get loans from. I love it so far.
ralph,I have enjoyed money lion there is just a few things I just don't understand and would like more information about. The investing and the credit helper.
zeinab,Money. Lion is the best i love it and i give it 50 stars being the best thank you
lillian,Love MoneyLion! Every time I'm low on cash I love that I have MoneyLion to hold me off until I get paid.
Just Me,It's a good app and helped me out alot
Agalelei Haro,I love money lion quick and fast the best
jessica,Yes money lion is a good thing to have and is very helpful and The customer service is very good 👍
christopher,Twice MoneyLion has deducted payments from my account before my pay date causing insufficient funds charges of $34 each time. I am on a fixed income paid once a month living day to day. My payment is available when I get paid--not before.
Melissa Mooers,I love Money Lion..very easy to apply and it is very reliable!
jeffery,Awesome bank. Helps build credit
Autonomous ,"Excellent Choice for Banking Services of any kind. Advances, Credit Repair, Rewards, and investing all in one. With assistance for each one.  I love this banking service."

ChoclateGamer ,Good way to get a little extra cash without the huge fees
SOLEIL D,Amazing helped me fund my first vacation Ever. Please don’t stop my account though it would be really hard to not to be able to borrow after borrowing. This has been a life changer for someone like me who gets paid once a month.
jose,Excellent help
Melinda D.,Great ☺️☺️ I love dis Bank ❤️❤️
timothy,Convenient and easy to use. Can keep cost.down if you wait a few days to get the money deposited.
Roberta,Love it. Love everything about it.
matthew gaddy,"I love money lion for the simple fact I can get a loan with no interest ! No apr rates , no credit checks/ impact and I can shift my payment date if needed. They give you extra boost and if unlock direct deposit you can get $250 whenever you need it. Quick and easy Thanks For one of the best apps yet."
Anthony,I can see how it would be an incredible app. I did the insta cash option because I needed some money before I get paid I was approved for $190! But with this app you can only transfer $50 at a time!! There is a fee and a tip that is charged every time you advance $50 to get to the total amount you were approved for! So in reality too advanced that total of $190 it would cost me almost $20 in fees Plus they ask for a tip!! In my opinion that's just greedy and it's a very poor business practice to kick people when they're already down!
Bb,"This app has really helped me out several times, if you need money quickly I'd suggest downloading this app!"
william,Sometimes the app doesn't let you log in but other then that it's amazing
Shonte ,"Honestly pretty great. When my paycheck doesn't deposit on time, MoneyLion helps me avoid overdraft fees. We also use it for spontaneous overnight trips and emergencies like vet visits. Thanks, Money Lion!"
thomas,"I love this app, the instant cash out has helped out tremendously.."
shaun,"Is just amazing, I love it."
johnathan,"This company is great for helping me make it from paycheck to paycheck it works flawlessly and easily, the only thing I have a critique on is that I wish they would let you take out the full amount instead of just $50 increments"
JenJen,This has been the best Payday advance app o have ever tried I love it
robyn,"My account was hacked twice. Each time my payday came, my account was hacked in less than a minute after my direct deposit was process to my account. This bank has no protection for its clients against hackers and my account has been been a victim of hacking over two times. When I call the customer service phone number, the agents gave different answer and no consistency whatsoever. When I changed email addresses, they were unable to send me a link to verify my address. Do not choose this company because you will regret it and I urge and strongly recommend anyone not to choose this bank because your money will be taken from you and you will have to wait over 10 business days to get it back. Worst bank ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)))))))"
Mary Bedford,Luv this app. It never lets me down
Patricia Bass,Stop charging extra for a tip everything I borrón money. That is why I'm borrowing because I'm broke.
Tia Theodore,Super awesome customer service. Quick response time and very user friendly app.

micheal,8uuujhhgffggvghiigffghiugghhhjiujbbvvv
tishthefish,Great service only hickup in 2 years was when I had to replace a card and my account started locking me out cause I had to make purchases through a 3rd party app and they thought it suspect. But even then best banking app I've seen
Cassandra Fisher,I absolutely love money lion I love the advances so handy
nicole,"Too many ads trying to sell me things, too many fees."
addam,MoneyLion has been great. Easy to use. Practical. I highly recommend it.
KEITH W.,Very helpful when you’re on a tight budget and need car repair 😌
richard,"Great. I was able to get 25$-50 but at the expense of putting mine and my kids account in the negative over $100 .. there's GOT to be a different option for this. Obviously if I had they monies in my account it would've been re payed. This isn't fair I understand the agreemens and ""fine print* but to do that isn't fair AND than to charge an incifficent funds fee on TOP of my banks which now is putting my account -$200 isn't fair. Since they've been paid back I obviously had to take my  overdrawn bank account off the money lion app and put a different one WHICH put my make borrow at $20 instead of $50. Should it not have something in place for incidents like this that happens so if the SAME person on the SAME account on the SAME app account only changes they're information bot PENALIZE THEM"
LT,"Great app, easy to use. Best banking app there is hands down, I would know I’ve tried them all"
ravyn,I signed up and had the money I needed in a few short hours. excellent service
christshawn,This is a great service for when you are in need of a little extra help
Ginger Bailey,I had the unfortunate mishap of using the wrong PIN number to many times resulting with all those failed attempts locking me out for 24 hours and that is kind of a setback and a nuisance really because there should be a way to bypass this common mistake for how many lions members and users who I could believe do this from time to time mistakes happen and being locked out for 24 hours without there being an alternative way to resolve the issue such as entering in the wrong PIN number too many times other than delaying the user 24 hours because in my case I needed that to pay not only a bill but for my family's groceries and I was not able to do that.
Dmm ,Moneylion is a good.source for extra funds. It helps if you are in-between pay periods.Thank you Moneylion..
Randy,"Always help me when i need it, wish the payments went towards my credit! Lol"
Teresa,Amazing fast simple money quick and easy
patty ,Randomly I need extra cash. I'm not rich and I am not in poverty but this app makes the in betweens manageable
kevin,Just the best ever!! Love the fact that I’m able to build my credit and borrow my without hurting my credit
James ,"Interest rate is just a little high.  Also, would be better if customer service as able to withdrawal  total amount in 1 transaction instead of small increments.  Each one charges a transaction fee and it adds up when you want to leave a tip."
April,Perfect banking app. 10/10 would recommend.
Lee Ann Post,This is the best app to have it help you out when most need it without any problem just link you bank account so they can proff your income to get you cash advance

matthewtaylor,Well money Lion is great except for the computer issues.
Renee,This company is a rip off. They let me take out a high amount in instacash for a few months then when they were paid back $144 they reduced how much I could take out all the way to $25 even though my income never changed. I was expecting to be able to take another advance of the same amount so this actually left me broke. No rhyme or reason!
rickey,"Moneylion is and wonderful, convenient and helpful emergency app."
aubree,Thank Money Lion for always being there financially when I need it.  Keep on helping.
bianca,MoneyLion has been there for me when no one else has all transactions are fast and simple always just a few taps away thank you guys you have a repeat customer

marcia,MoneyLion makes it easy to request loan advances and easy to pay back.
Samuel Good,I had made a call to moneylion last week to move my Instacash Repayment to THURSDAY! Well the jerks there didn't hear me and made it for Tuesday (yesterday) and my account was in the overdraft. Might uninstall as soon as my fiancee starts working
John,"Great service, easy to use"
willie,They cheated me with me
jenifer,"Why is my virtual card, add money, transfer not work"

Tyrod Lee ,Money lion is great always good to know a company is looking out for the small guy

Guantrell Burt,Excellent wonderful financial resource
Frank De La Rosa,I think you guys have been great so far. I just transferred my direct deposit to you so hopefully all goes well and you keep doing the great things you have been.
adrian,Money Lion is always there when i need help the most. Has had some technical issues before but other than that I've enjoyed using Money Lion for my direct deposits and investing.
Monet,I have emailed n called n had too wait hour to talk to somebody.
jeanna,I'm a Leo; MoneyLion has been the best birthday present I could have given to myself for a mobile bank account with great and dependable features.
Priscila Mattei garcia,"MoneyLion has been a huge help with rebuilding credit and being more financially secure these last couple years. I have used the credit builder loans, instacash, investment options and I love the sponsored apps that help with financials as well."
Molly,The only issue I have is that I have direct deposit and it is still asking me to add my direct deposit to raise my insta cash I have $1264 going in every 2 weeks and I'm only able to get $75 other than that it's a good app
Royce,"I'VE BEEN USING MONEYLION FOR APPROXIMATELY TWO MONTHS. FOR THE MOST PART, IT'S BEEN BENEFICIAL TO ME FOR COVERING ANY SHORTFALL I HAVE TO COVER MY BILLS. THE ONLY MINOR NEGATIVE IS, HAVING TO RELINK MY BANK ACCOUNT; BUT IT WAS EXPLAINED THAT THIS IS DUE TO THEIR SYSTEM (PLAID) THAT IMPLEMENTS UPDATES. I LIKE THAT MONEYLION INCREASES YOUR AVAILABLE INSTANT CASH AMOUNT WITH EACH ON TIME REPAYMENT.  OVERALL, IT SEEMS TO BE A SAFE; SECURE APP TO BORROW MONEY AS NEEDED.One thing that could be modified, is to allow an $100.00 Instant Cash transaction with one Turbo fee ; instead of having to do two separate $50.00 transactions that results in two Turbo fees being applied."
Nova,"Horrible experience. Customer support is a joke. I used to be a fan of their Instacash service, but the Plus Loan and associated membership is a total scam. If you are considering this, DON'T! They give you $115 and get that almost entirely back immediately by taking $96.30, and if you manage to stop those you won't stop the $19.99 monthly fees which accumulate in a never ending fashion. I am going to have to close my bank account to stop them. They refuse to cancel it. Do yourself a favor and STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS EVIL BUSINESS."
deon,I highly recommend Moneylion. I have had only positive experiences with them
Jessica Hileman,MoneyLion has been a big help to me during this pandemic and my hardship at home.

gerald,I have had very good experiences with my moneylion accounts from my roar money card to investing and my credit builder loan and instacash
REBECCA OFTON,The insta cash boost is great when it actually comes through. I hit the boost for extra funds in tight situations. But it doesn't come through all the time. It is what it is.
Emily Nefcy,Money Lion has really helped out when I needed it and tries to implement ways to help its patrons.
Kyle,"Money excellent with the instacash , zero % apr so worth it and company can be trusted"

I appreciate how easy it is to sign up and how fast and easy it is to request and receive my funds.I use their debit card so when I need that bit of extra I can request it and it is immediately. I also love that each time i use the debit card I get a shake reward and the rewards really add up in my investments."
RS,Love Love LOVE this app. It has helped me out greatly credit wise!
Matthew Simon Kessel,Having great experience with moneylion. They are really good to me and no issues and if you have an issue they resolved it quickly.
lisha,The app itself isn't bad at all but if you have any problems you are on your own. Ive had to call custo.er service twice and both times I was left on hold 20 mins and they came back to tell me they needed more time. Said they would call me back but never did.
april,I love money lion I love the knowledge that I have gained for finances I love the constructive criticism that it gives you on saving money and my financial literacy has really stepped up due to money lion. Let’s not forget all of the tools that they give you access to for becoming a member and it’s fantastic especially the Insta cash that is available for having direct deposit it’s amazing when you need an extra few dollars to pay for things
emily,I had to ask around for money so that way i dont end up negative in my account. All because customer service didnt honor my default on my insta cash payment as they made the mistake. Their excuse is once its defaulted 1x i cant default again even though it was them that made the mistake.
Danny Rogers,MoneyLion is amazing and come in clutch when I need cash.
james,"I love this app. Accurate, easy and amazing. I would highly recommend."
demetrice how,Helps when i certain debt to cover

Casey Hurley,It's dependable and helps you build credit amazing.
Rene Valdez,It's the best online banking but.. The instacash takes most of my check for the fees and the tips. I received more then enough to up my instacash but doesn't let me receive more .
"Mr, Ed",Money Lion has been a life saver for me. Always there with the amount needed to get me through. Easy to use and understand App.
Augustus Escareno,"Everything was just fine until they closed my account for ""suspicious activity"". I've had the account for a good while and my transaction activity has not changed since day 1. They told me to send them a bunch of documents and an explanation of some transactions to reopen the account but gave me inoperable links to send the stuff to. When I told them about the problem with the links suddenly nobody is available and the conversation is over. Difficult to communicate with, won't give you information about your acct. They have caused me quite a headache and several problems to deal with. Do not give them your money!"
martha,This is a great app
Amanda Viox,Very easy nice transaction. Very impressed!
Awilda Vazquez,Best ever they come clutch with everything from credit building to investment and loans
linda,Best app ever always there for me when i need it the most. Evaluates your bank and gives you instacash based on that. Very helpful can do hundreds of other things too like invest in crypto to building your credit. 10/10 would recommend!

Regena Andrews,Very quick and easy to get a cash advance or even a loan. I LOVE MONEYLION!
diliana,"Perfect app ,💯❤️😂🤑😍"
Dawn D,I really enjoy using MoneyLion. They have come a long way since I first joined. They have made the app more user friendly and I really enjoy the unexpected instacash. It is always a nice surprise. I believe they listen to their customers and do their best to accommodate. I definitely recommend MoneyLion if you are looking to build credit or just want a great financial app to use!
Michele Ferguson,Easily accessible and convenient. I think its a little expensive but its a small price to pay for the convenience it offers. I don't care for the tip thing bim paying enough in interest to not be bothered with tipping who exactly?
Lori Pietila,Moneylion is clutch. If you pay your loans back on time your instacash amount grows. Also they have a credit builder loan that you pay a little on each month and it does great to help grow your credit score
T Butler,East to use and helpful with building credit
customer,This is a great app they allowed me up to $600 in a pay period it helps when you need the extra boost in between paydays.
Claire Smith,"MoneyLion has been a life-saver multiple times for me. It’s easy, quick, trustworthy, and an all around great service! My only complaint is that I wish you could pick your repayment date when requesting instacash. Sometimes it is way too soon after the advance it gives you, and can be stressful. Although they do offer a way to defer payments, it isn’t 100% a quick fix. But other than that, I have no complaints and would highly recommend it!"
customer,Money Lion the app is great. You can stay on top of everything.
p. z,i love the cash back perks. Instacash loan and all the tips on how to see and build your credit

Kathy Barnes,Never ever had any issues! Has helped me when I need a few bucks till payday
hdanielle,I've been using money line for about a month now and it actually helps me out a lot if sometimes it's hard to get into the app but once you get in you can get your loan with no problem and you get it instant thanks moneylion for always being there
Yesi ,"There’s a lot of features that MoneyLion offers that is very beneficial to users. There’s the credit builder loan which reports your payments to the credit bureaus thus helping your credit score improve. There’s also instacash which works similar to other apps like Dave and Earnin. The reason I give 4 and not 5 stars is because the features for paying your loan payments are limited and if you ever fall behind a payment, they don’t offer the option to make a partial payment which could be beneficial depending on a persons situation. It’s a lot easier for someone to catch up by making small payments versus making one larger payment."
roberto,It's a decent app dave is another really good one
RYAN,Great financial tool and resource. Deserves 6 stars
Keith,Good idea in a pinch. Works similar to a payday loan without the ridiculous fees. So when you get paid you pay it right back.
dakota,I love this. Adding a tip instead of getting a payday loan that is plain robbery
brittany,It's there when you need it and it's been very helpful since I'm on disability
melinda,MoneyLion is an amazing app! I didn’t trust it at first but I went through with it and it turned out very helpful.
Demetrius Bryant,Great product s and great along with fast support.  Tools to help with credit score and loans when your in a tight squeeze.  Never has failed me.
christopher,Awesome app easy to use and no hassle
Patrisha Pettus,"Moneylion always helps me when im in a bind, i am very grateful for them."
Melissa Buss,I like how easy it is to get a loan as well as access insta cash
Ms.Libra,"I've been with Moneylion for a couple of months, and I love it. The cash advance feature is great. The only thing I would critique is the interest on the credit builder loan. It's pretty high. The idea of the credit builder loan is great, but the interest rate of almost 30% is kind of ridiculous. It's basically a high interest personal loan for people with crappy credit. Otherwise I'd be giving this app 5 stars."
Jacqueline Paglia,"Fast, and easy to use"
Chawn Morgan,Money Lion is amazing and can help in a tight situation or just to build you credit. They are very understanding and you can even change your repayment date if something comes up.
Kierra Whitee,MoneyLion is always there in any case of emergency! Very helpful!

Melissa Pate,Pretty decent app haven’t had any issues.

Lisha Brantley,Quick easy professional. Easy to use app.

abdirahman,"I have had a moneylion account for about a year and I have used their credit builder plus products and have gotten a few loans and have successfully paid them back and moneylion is supposed to send me the money they keep in what they call credit reserves,  my last loan I paid of about 3 months ago and they have failed to send me my money I spoke with a representative on the phone with moneylion and they are aware of the problem and did not advise me of this issues and on top of that even though my loan has been repay they said I was late on my account and has dropped my credit score,  so I'm very  upset with moneylion, this has been my experience with moneylion"
tedrianna,I still have not received the money. My linked account has not changed...it went into roaring money account but I tried to transfer into my personal account but I don't have it
sean,This app is worth having. Help me in so many ways. My credit score went up 79 points
rebecca,Good 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Gamma Neece,Excellent service I got exactly what I needed. Only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it offered me $50 and then after I went through the process it turned out I could have gotten a little extra money
mark,Great appWouldn't make it through some days if I didn't have instant boost to help me out until my next payday so I really appreciate this.
felipe,I was travelling from TN to NH and I realized I was short on cash. After frantically searching I came across MoneyLion. They were the only ones offering same day money in my account. I was able to check my bag at the airport and grab a bite to eat for the journey home.I've been a customer ever since.
steven,Just as good as chime
James Brissel,"MoneyLion is great, easy to use with amazing customer service people ready to answer your questions.  MoneyLion is my #1 banking option. They've treated me better in a couple months time than the bank I'd been with for years. 🥰"

Lakesha Thurman,👍 when low are money really is wonderful to providing. Thanks
Leslie Langley Miller,If I could give a review between a 3 and 4 I would. The service is great. It is very very helpful. The only thing that upsets me is the low amount you can take at once and the very high fees included compared to other similar apps. But I’m still loyal to Money Lion and will continue using their services. Thank you.
cristina,"Always there right in time.  I needed a little extra cash to get me to payday and boom, they contacted me to notify me I had extra funds available.  Thanks money lion"

Byron Pruitt,It's been so awesome when I need a little money in a pinch.
Christy Chapman,I can only take out 50 at a time!!!That’s annoying And then it asks me for me to link my bank account everytime I take out money and that’s even more annoying because I have already linked it so many times!!It’s just a bad app period!Wish it was more easier to use maybe I’ll change my mind in my opinion
tanya,Awesome so great
Suzanne Hicks ,Great app. Very helpful
laura,It’s easy and helps me out when I need it. It does get you into a cycle tho. When you pay it back then you need it for something else so you have to use it again so once you are in it’s hard to get out.
stephanie,"They knew the problem I need to resolve. Building credit. Simple, secure. And delivered to expectations."
Heather Whalen,Helped me in a bind more than once with instacash. Thank you

steve terry,You guys were there when I needed you thanks again.Alex
ashlee,Doesn’t give you much money in total and only in $50 increments. Won’t let you join the credit builder plus program and customer service was not at all helpful in finding out why. It’s okay if you need maybe gas money but not really enough to pay a bill or anything.
James Brooks,This is like a money nest whenever you fall short from the unexpected
joy,I love Money lion they loan me money between pay days and it is fast and easy to use.
Natasha Waggoner,I love the moneylion app I've had no problems with the app itself

Danny Phasavath,I LOVE THIS COMPANY! I have been a member for over 3 years and MONEYLION has definately helped me improve my credit score and my finances. I RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY TO ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO GET THEIR FINANCES BACK ON TRACK!!!
Erica miller,"Money lion pretty good service and helpful customer service too. Kind of a all in one shop, can do some banking, investing, and savings there. Quick loans are easy accessible but will change depending on what is going on in your life. Overall rating is excellent."
patricia,Love the instacash feature especially when I need a little extra
marcus dowd,This an awesome app!! No problems or complaints!!

courtney,MoneyLion is awesome. They’re there when you need them. Thank you MoneyLion
richard,This goes back to the customer  service I received with my loan. It took more than stated time frame for me to receive my funds. Customer service gave me the run around. That put me in an unnecessary financial burden. As soon as I pay off this loan I’ll probably leave the platform. But the concept of Money lion is a good one. Just need better execution and customer service.
Mark Miller,"great app, willing to spot you what your eligible for and you can renew instantly."
cynthia,"I was told the wait time would be 3 minutes and i waited for 10, i finally get a rep and was only partially helped. I tried to keep the rep on the phone to help work through my issue and i was rushed off the phone and told that my issue was resolved, after hanging up my issue was not and still is not resolved. I am very unhappy and disappointed with this service."
Slingshot,Great app to get you focused on how to manage and get the most out of your money Easy to use
Brittany Gibson,"You guys don’t help when a charge is on a account that you didn’t make. Till this day I have submit the forms for this transaction that was fraudulent on my acct for 29$ for Etech.com back on Feb 13, 2021 that has not been refund to me as of today. So I wouldn't recommend anyone."
Amy,I love money lion! No hidden fees and no problems letting me borrow even when it’s payday I don’t have to wait a day to borrow again and it’s available shortly after I use instacash
Tanisha Fitzgerald,"I can not express how amazing moneylion helps, I love it!"
Cheryl,I love MoneyLion and how I can use Insta cash when I need it. Plus with the stock portfolio you can invest whatever you can afford. I am going transfer my direct deposit to MoneyLion from Chime.
Lyssa ,It's a great service and it has helped me alot in managing money also with my credit score. The only reason I didn't do five star is its always reminding you bout insta cash and although they don't charge interest the amount you get is low and it charges you at least 6.98 because you have to leave a tip and if you don't want to wait a week it's 3.99. Also when I don't need Instacash I can always take out more than normal but when I'm in need and hurting I don't get the same option so it kind of a kick to The ass. But all in all not bad I would recommend .
Wesley Walker,Love this app. About to direct deposit half my check in here.  Its helped me so much
michaela,I love instracash it very simple to get pay back what u owe and it also help you build credit paying on time live MoneyLion thank you it has been a big help.

Zachary Cockrill.,I love MoneyLion Instacash!  It is there when I need it and only takes seconds to obtain it.
jasmine,Easy to use and a bunch of features to use if you want. No fees just leave a tip if you want.
patricia,Its a cool app. I just wish the fees for cash out was not do high. I am in a situation so we all know how goes. Just thanking God every time
robert,Great place for younger adults to get their credit going!
Joe Medley Jr,Forceing you to 50 at a time and no more adds to many fee's
Darnell Redmond,I love the convenience of the advancements.
thomas,Awesome service
Tamara,The instacash helps out a lot and pretty much anyone can get it. Very convenient and easy.
shanice,I am a little upset with your bank because we have insurance with our MasterCard/Visa debit card and when you get screwed by another buyer that didn’t took your money and you go to your bank for that you should have got my back I’ve had a couple boxes with the disputes I’ve called your bank five times and you keep pushing it and telling me later and later and it still nothing has ever responded to me about it or done anything with it and that’s why I don’t think I will stay with you
Michelle,"I have no idea how I found. Money Lion but so glad I did as I have had to use the insta cash a couple of times , it is the best short term online loan I have seen so far , very reasonable on fee for fast delivery and does not require a tip but why wouldn't you too of it helps you out of a bind like it has me .....7 stars from me great job and I hope one day I won't need help like this but until then I'm glad Money Lion is around !!!!"

Phil ,Always right on time when I need to helping hand.
TRACY,"This is much better than other advance apps I've used. No matter what my balance is, I get an advance - because I always repay in a timely fashion. I've dealt with companies who get repaid and still won't give you an advance."
Tee,Greatest online banking check out all the money making opportunities involved for yourselfIts more than worth a look
randy,I have used moneylion about a month. I have only good things to say about this app. Since I've started off the jump i was approved for $50 instacash.

Christine Bordere,I few months ago! I actually paid a 373.88 comast bill that wasn't mine ! Appreciated the opportunity to be lied to by the associates several times! They didn't process the claim correctly and didn't give me my money back and basically strung me along for weeks ! I just noticed another problem this morning and realized that I am paying for a acct to a credit counseling service and this is been taken out for 6 months! Strange because I turned off my debit card months ago after the first discrepancy! I can hardly wait for the snotty associates that don't do there job to help me! Thanks for notifying me that you don't have a great interest in protecting the people who pay for your job! I was a store director for 27 years! And customer service isn't available at money lion !
Heather Taylor,Very easy app to use. Convenient and reliable way to get cash when it is very much needed. Thank you moneylion for your help!

Jason,I’ve been waiting almost a year for what was left in my credit reserve account of $41.26 to refunded back to me and I’ve been given the run around since August 2020. I HAVE to be compensated for this situation. This situation  could’ve been avoided by all means. I’m honestly stressed out and aggravated because NOBODY has contacted me to talk me about this situation. This is NOT good business practice. How would you feel if you was in my situation.
Joshua Stone,I’m so thankful for MoneyLion! Excellent customer service.
antonette,Always comes thru when I need it the most
brenda,They do things... Good things :D

Steven Royce,"Terrible. I called and got some customer service person that couldn’t understand me. I asked for a supervisor and she put me on hold 4 times for no less than 30 total minutes only to tell me one would call me back. It’s been 1.5 weeks and I still haven’t received a call back. Absolutely terrible.UPDATE: They replied to this review and asked me to contact them. I did and they still haven't contacted me back. I've now asked for a supervisor 3 times in over a week and not one call back as promised. HORRIBLE!UPDATE 7/28 - A very nice woman named Lea reached out and did assist me and is working on correcting the original issue all of this began over. It took way too much effort, time, and frustration but in the end she stepped in and is working to make it all better."
mark,I have been working with MoneyLion for over a year and I absolutely love how you allProvide services to me. I love instacashand I love your customer support that you provide.

S. M. Larson,So far so good with using moneylion its one of the best banking apps there is
john d,I have used moneylion for a few years now and they are an amazing financial service. There instacash feature had helped me out allot and it's able to be accessed just by linking your bank. They offer credit builder accounts also which I haven't used. They also offer an amazing managed investment account which is really nice.
Justin Verdugo,"Raymond was great. Just the issue is difficult and waiting for it to resolved. Again, kudos to Raymond."
"TAYLOR, B.",I absolutely love money lion not only is it helping me bills my credit but helps me in times when I really need
Maria,The only issue I have with Moneylion is you can only take an advance of $50 at a time instead of one lump sum payment. So if you need $200 you take 4 loans and charged individually if you tip or do rush pay. Otherwise I love everything about it.
Tegemo Kennedy,This is the greatest app for anyone who need to build credit fast !
CBH Montana,"Bank account has been frozen going on 6 days causing missed payments that I had linked.  When you call customer support, they can’t give you an answer or help out anyway, I mean absolutely USELESS no help at all!!. Wish I would of stayed away from this bank and company."
connor,"Amazing customer service, very quick and helped solve my questions and issues immediately. MoneyLion is changing the game as to what customer service and all service banking SHOULD be. Thank you MoneyLion!"
Sarinna ,Its truly Amazing its a really big help for me! 👏
kirk weiskittel,"It’s a pretty reliable service in a pinch, but some of the loans aren’t worth their time with interest rates exceeding other lenders. The ability to borrow allows for a lot of short term growth and cash flow, but the rates do often make me consider other lenders and some of the dates make me weary of trying larger products like the credit builder loan."
john,Money lion is always there when I need it.
anthony,Money lion is a great way to build your credit. I would highly recommend.

carlos,The money lion app is a great app. The instacash feature has been a life saver. The credit builder loan not only helped me access an extra $200 when I needed it but the monthly payments are low and it is boosting my credit score. It is great for seeing a snapshot of your income and spending. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone and everyone.

Windom Conner,"I have been a loyal MoneyLion customer for almost 5 years and have enjoyed being part of their growth and innovation during these years. ML is on top of their game and always steps ahead of the competitors. As a continuous CB Plus member, I've reaped the benefits of the credit builder plus loan three times and watched my credit score increase over 100 points to date; I am an avid user of Instacash and have watched my investment account build and thrive effortlessly. I will be with MoneyLion to the very end! It's the only bank for me!"
rashawn,I fell asleep. Driver followed orders but restaurant still called to make sure i received.   I have been in the area for 10+ years and this is  the best sushi and food I have tasted.  The pad thai.  Drunken noodle. And general tso chicken. All beyond delish!!!’l
Gloria ,It's easy and great to be able to adjust the amount you ask for but for getting the instacash and having to pay 5.99 for instant everytime isn't very cool
dannika,:) always there in a pinch
Brian King,"MoneyLion is the only credit builder, loan, financial company I truly use and trust."

Liz Rodriguez,Moneylion has been the best most up-to-date safe secure and dependable bank I've ever used you will not be disappointed make the switch today I guarantee it
Sharree Harvey,Moneylion has continuously impressed me as getting to learn all of its benefits and features 4 members. It does have some difficult areas they should smoothing out if you can link a bank account to their services you should be able to transfer funds between those accounts without fees or without rapid speed free without charge but as I continued I'm finding a lot of nice features that have helped me in tough spots for car repairs for groceries and the occasional need to pay a bill so I will continue using moneylion and I do recommend it for those who live I'm real human banking needs similar to Dave thinking that is also been great to me I choose to use both these accounts to get through and budget My Crazy Life that I can't make sense out of
charles,"I love Moneylion! I first just signed up because I needed $ help and to take out a $ advance. But this company and this app is so much more than that. I'm blown away with how much they do for someone! Right now I'm learning more about budgeting, yes you can learn about financing and I'm also working on my credit and raising my credit score with a credit builder account. If you're like me and didn't learn much about finances in school or growing up,  then I highly recommend this app and this company!"
Spring Blankenship Henry,I find Money Lion to be very handy and thinking about making it my main bank account. The only suggestion is having some ability to change the due date when taking out Instacash. Like extending the due date a couple days.
jessica,I am getting access to my paycheck a full 24 hours faster then my bank was making it available and it is amazing be able to get a cash advance when you really need it!
Tyasia Edmonds,"I like the services but I'm consistently being charges a withdrawal fee in error when using in network All point ATM's. Called to try and resolve this. Representative just kept saying that ATM's must not be in network. And while speaking with Representative, I was on the All point website looking at the Arms I used listed. I even verified my card for these ATM's. Instead of Representatives just saying anything that they obviously don't know, they need to go to All point site and look. MoneyLion owes me close to $50 in fees that I should never have been charged. And i'm still being charged. It still has not been resolved because no one there hears the truth. I guess they only know what they're told to say to rip off customers."
Lisa,I thought the process of obtaining the loam was easy and understandable. The only thing I don't like is the funds didn't go directly to my account. I had transfer them and pau a fee and therefore didn't get everything I needed. It was helpful though
charles,MoneyLion is the best app for instant loans when times get rough!  Ive tried so many others and none of them even come close to being as easy and helpful as MoneyLion.  Thank you MoneyLion!
jaleesa,Very great good information shares
Eddie,I love this app. So easy to set up and use. They are the best ever. Thank you MoneyLion for always helping me out
Everardo Becerra ,I love this app! Always comes in handy for unexpected bills. Also helped to improve my credit score with a small loan
Ezell Hudson II,MoneyLion is great but the only thing that I don’t like is that you can only take cash in $50 increments. I realize this is to get increased fees but it’s not very customer centric.
Tara Logan,I love that I was able to get a loan I appreciate your chance to show I have grown as and responsible adult and it was just in time for a bill
arodys,I we'll start by saying I recommend anyone and everyone you have financial obligations to download this app. It has helped me greatly and I have nothing but great reports to give you. It doesn't just teach you about how to maintain your finances but it does it for you and much much more

amanda,The best ! When you need cash fast. Have been using for months!
Michael A Dowd,I love the concept but you keep overdrawing my account. I asked fir a deferment and you didn't.  Getting  a hold of customer service is impossible. Now I'm told that they can't make my payments at the time specified so my account will just overdraw in the middle of the pay period.
Tina Martin,"Moneylion is great!  The only con I would have is the fact that you can only get $50 at a time and for instant deposit, you have to pay $4-5 each time."
kayla,MoneyLion is a fantastic company that always helps me out when I need it. My only slight issue is I wish you could take out more at one time then just $50. That's not that big of a deal so I would highly recommend then to anyone.
eric,No issues. Everything was quick and efficient.
T C,I think would be a better app if it would allow to take more than 50.00 at a time.
feliberto,Easy and helpful. No hidden surprises. Very useful!

nathan,"I been with Moneylion well over a year now, and so far, so good! I like that i can wall into a local store, because in a small town you dont have many options, & load more money onto your card right then and there. It instantly goes thru, and same for the ""instacash"", if you need spotted cash Moneylion has your back there too! Would recommend..."

Chuck,Great app. I'm a fan. Really helps in times of need.
Kelli Stasik,This is awesome * credit rebuilding loans & cash advances ~ if needed * this is a genuine top of the line gem *
Ashley,Great amount of opportunities to get loans with good amounts and random ones when you really need the help especially someone like me. With no stupid hidden fees like other apps.
laci,Money lion is probably the best apps to save money and borrow with 0% Apr rates why wouldn't you go with The lion vs the other guys.
daniel,Money line should really double check the algorithm on qualifying account for example if you have another direct deposit like your taxes or your stimulus it throws out the algorithm for your direct deposit so you default back to the original 50 75 or $25. Also there is a three pay check hold until your account goes in back into the normal standard. I thought moneylionwas here to help the consumer but you are hurting the consumer if we are being punished for receiving taxes and stimulus check
rodney,My experience was awesome! Everything was easy to understand.
Benito Noriega,"Best ever ! No hidden fees. I've never had a problem with any transaction. Also, the app is full of financial help and offers."
Lwarden,Love this place my debit card was compromised when I was in Louisiana and i was able to use Moneylions card to pay my way home.

brittney,Great App - Tried most of them and this one is the best.

Shannon O'Dell,Money Lion is great. It's helpful and has great resources.
Alexis Roman,I am starting to think I should delete my moneylion account. I do not like that sometimes I get charged a random fee and money is taken from me that I need but moneylion does not care to return it. I try to use Instacash and since I can't afford to leave a tip my Instacash gets put on hold and I can't use it. Moneylion is a rip off and me and my husband are very unhappy with this app. My husband already deleted his account and I might do it too if moneylion doesn't get there ish together
elijah,Awesome bank
jesse,Love it. It’s a great app
Jeff Layne,The rep that responded to all my Google reviews has basically kept me as a customer as I was really ready to leave moneylion due to all the issues with the app. They have all been fixed now except the notifications that are continuing to bother me weekly offering me boosts for cash that never end up being in the app for me to take advantage of. Unfortunately this has happened to my referral as well so idk of we will continue with moneylion. Sorry. Too many issues with the app. The developers need to step up and fix this crap show. Thankful for all the help Kayla gave to me your awesome! She deserves 5 stars for sure!
mary,Easy process! Would highly recommend if you need a few bucks to get by before payday.  On top of which you are not paying outrageous interest.

rachel,"I can't access my account to access someone to chat about my inability to access my account!!!! Phone support ends at 4pm eastern time.I didn't have an issue until 4pm mountain time and there isn't any support for me or anyone else with account issues at all!And it's basically a message saying sorry about your bad luck or timing, were gone so try and get thru the night anyway you can and catch us here between this time if you get a chance to, we'll be here, maybe!"

derek,Great business I love this it's very helpful.
Amber,"I like the instacash, but other institutions that offer partial cash advances don't charge for the instant deposit. Charging me 5 bucks, on top of the 20 dollars I pay monthly, plus tips, it's just ridiculous. The 5 dollar fee should be dropped, or at least let me cash out twice as much at a time."
Bazza,I made a deposit to my investment account like required and didn’t get the bonus at all still haven’t heard from support at all the representative when I call was very helpful and professional but the other team haven’t heard from themChange my review due to customer service is looking into issue and they responded right away that’s awesome service hopefully my issue gets resolve

Rosalba De La Cruz,Moneylion is the Best. Money deposited right away when you need it. Fast and Quick. Definitely will use again.      Kim
Alex Powers,"This really is an amazing app. Not only is it very easy to get a Credit Builder Loan, but the funds are deposited very quickly and the payments are small and easy. They also offer resources such as Banking, Investment, and Instacash. Instacash is very quick and easy and also very affordable. You pay what you think is fair and the funds can be deposited instantly for a small fee. Things have changed over the years, but all for the better. I think the most significant change is in the customer service. The ChatBot can answer most questions and if you choose to call the representatives are very kind and helpful!"
nicole,It really helped in an urgent time!
Derek Martin,MoneyLion is a great app. It helps you keep up with your money and where you spend.

Melissa H.,"Always fair, responsive and delivers tirelessly."
daniel,My account was hacked. The hacker changed my email on my account. I do not feel they have enough safe cards to stop this type of thing from happening. I am very upset.
Diamond,There were several accounts that have been hacked over the weekend and the company has not communicated that customers information has been compromised. There has been no urgency to have this resolved I am nearly out of 900 dollars and the only solution your customer service has advised is wait two weeks. I am disputing my charges and contacting the BBB. I highly advise not to download this app.
maritza,Always helps me out of a jam very grateful for this service
Crystal Landeros,Money loin great company help out bind txs so munch for all hard work
Tyquan Landrum,"My account was hacked and almost a thousand dollars were transferred to an unknown account. Is there no social security number check or email check before allowing this amount of loans to be processed?I contacted support immediately and was told they'd lock my account while looking into the issue.The support ticket was then immediately closed without resolution. Since my account is locked, I can't use the app to contact them again so I guess I'm going to be on the phone for a while...Trustpilot reviews and Google play reviews show I'm not the only one so I believe their system was compromised. Issue has not been addressed on any of the complaints I've seen."
james,"Im still having the same direct deposit issue with moneylion, my payment was sent to moneylion on 7/19/21, why isn't customer care available 24hr 7days a week, only open mon thru friday 8am to 5pm?"

Still not got my debt card it's been a month this is trash no customers support they say it themselves I am sorry that is the only thing true they are sorry excuse for any wish they where a bank. No one has contacted me like they claim. Their liers..

Whether you want to engage in an investment platform,build credit, borrow money, or utilize a great debit card option that rewards you with cash back opportunities that are likely better than many financial institutions of today."
Christina H,"I love it, very convenient."
Kevin Nease,Money did not go directly into account.Having trouble accessing now
brian,It’s not so easy to ask questions. If you made it like it used to be where I can see my credit report that would be easier and if my shake and bake rewards were more than two cents because my boyfriend got $20 wants 40 $40 I’m sorry and I have not gotten anything more than a quarter maybe a dollar I got one that would be nice to. Oh and the Insta cash I think it should be a little bit more sorry I had trouble paying it in the beginning but I’m all caught up now so I think I should have more and my boyfriend should have more to even though he doesn’t have direct deposit
roy,Great service
Anthony McKenzie,Great service
cheyenne,Simple and easy to use. Love being able to have the Instacash feature.

Phill Webb,"I'm really upset with you guys. Friday i paid off my Instacash loan and received a email saying Money Lion received my payment and I can use Instacash again.  So, Saturday I took out my Instacash advance again.  A few hours later, you guys took $409 out of my bank account.  Today when I checked my bank statement I seen you guys take that money out.  So I tried to log in my Money Lion account and couldn't. Now that I'm in it's not allowing my to see my account info. I tried calling customer service but they are closed for the weekend.  I'm need a answer and access to my account so I can see what happened"

Disdatday Allday,"I love it. I have even switched my direct deposit to MoneyLion. The only thing I see that MoneyLion don’t have besides an investment account, there is no separate savings account. And also you can’t use the Creditbuilder Loan unless you have an outside account with another bank."

Before the hacker could get the money. Ive been a freaking mess so worried and I’ve heard nothing about it and can’t sign into net account account. I didn’t even receive a confirmation saying hey we’re investigating.. it’s been a week now.. like what the heck.. this guy could be digging more and more into my stuff or could have taken that money and I have no idea! Very concerned!"
paula,Overall an easy app to use and for low cost get money on card in seconds which in itself is great I just would prefer to chose your amount as opposed to 50$ increments
Linda Blair,I am very disappointed and quite dumbfounded by the moneylion customer service and a few supervisors very unprofessional and rude. I recently had to put complaints in and escalations and still have yet to be contacted by a higher superior of a supervisor that totally disregarded and Ignored the fact of there mistakes my rights and the law
juliee,"I love this app, I haven’t found any other payday loan that will work with you when something like real every day banking mistakes happen and their customer service is great and well trained, so you don’t have to get transferred time and time again fir the right answer or help if you even get it. This App allows you to do way more then just banking and advances and much more!              Thank you money Lion"
erin,Amazing BANK!!! 👏THANK YOU Moneylion for having my back in this trying TIMES.great bank
ROBERT BROWN,THE BEST APP EVER  LEARNING HOW TO INVEST......AWESOME  DAILY TIP....AWESOME..CASHBACKS....TERRIFIC....BUT INSTACASH.....PRICELESS....
Star,MoneyLion is awesome. Easy to use especially when I needed it. Perfect . No complaints.
boucho,I love using moneylion...
andrew,This app is amazing to get an at a glance view at your finincial health. Plus the insta cash option is great when in a pinch before payday.
Jeff,I have used moneylion for quite some time.  I really have not had any issues.  I think you should he able to draw more than $50 at a time and the fee for turbo only when it goes to another bank because there's also a tip involved. The membership fees are also a little high in order to borrow the $500
janice,"Best online banking app I've ever used,hands down...Highly recommend 👍🏾👍🏾"
shenell,Been perfect for emergencies
connie,I love this app it helps you gain knowledge in all aspects of your finances and growth.
jaqueline,The instacash comes in handy especially during Covid
deonna,Good sevice for everything that is automated.   Two issues.   Unable to unlink accounts it always show errors message and instant cash should be set up for month to month not every to weeks but its a good seller if you need cash right away.
Brion Harris,Instant cash it’s a life saver best fastest way to  get that little extra money money Lyon it’s been by far the best money app I have tried. Highly recommended no hidden bs straightforward.💕
thomas,Great way to build credit and get extra money in a pinch!!!
Sam,Pretty great when you need a little help and guidance. Some of the options come with way to many scams.
Bluetonnz,Perfect !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
jasmine,It's easy to go through the process to get the money you need now.
roderick,"Money Lion is the best, very easy to acquire advances to help you out, along with very informative topics and links to help keep you on track. Thank you Money Lion. Your the best"
Courtney Brown,"Moneylion really helped me out of a jam in that I was overdrawn and it still forwarded the requested money.  This works for me since I can still use my debit card to a maximum overdraft amount set by the bank.  If I""m at the maximum, adding the money lion funds allows me to use the funds.  It can also be used to remove an overdraft balance that would generate an overdraft fee that is far larger than the 10% money lion fee."
Work in progress,"MoneyLion is a terrific app for banking, loans, cash advances, and credit score enhancement. By far the most innovative and flexible banking app I’ve seen. 5 Stars!"
cordell,I would like to get more money when I get a n advance

tyra,"Honestly I love money lion but lately it’s ruined my financial life as I feel I’m qualified know I’m qualified for more instacash and I receive 2500 worth of direct deposit abs get direct deposits of 500 every Monday and it keeps changing,. Used to have 250 and I’m paying my loan payment on time and they say are late and my insta is paused and like ya I don’t understand why though. They need to have actual people to fix this and not relay in the app and AI to verify."
Larry ,"Money lion is a great way to get money fast when u need it, I've referred it to a few people."
Lisa Jones,Very convenient
alexis,Easy approval!  Great app and customer service.
forsaken sadness,Best bank I have delf with in a long time
James Jones,Well moneylion used to be good but now they only loan $75 so it's not really worthy to me. So I made my last borrowed cash and no more after this.
christopher,Moneylion help protect my finances to keep my money where it belongs in my pocket
jeremy,Always there when I need him! Dave is the way to go instant cash in seconds.
pvivienne,Added too many extra charges to transfer money. We pay a monthly membership fee. That should more than cover access to all the perks of this service. Also banking is not a tipped service why would I tip you after paying $5 just to have quicker access to my money? I pay you $155+ just to have access to $130 and you still try to sneak a tip in there every time. Yes I’m sure I don’t want to tip stop automatically setting a $5 tip each time!!! Use the fee for your tip!
barry,Needed help until payday and Money Lion was there. And the boosts are great especially when u pay back on time.
virginia,"Reliable LendingMoneyLion not only is it fast, but also convenient.Also there for funding in a crunch when you need it, I have utilized various lending apps and this if by far my favorite and the most reliable. If you are looking to get help with extra cash this is one I would highly recommend, I have been using it for over 2 years now."
Cassie Watterson,"Information is always accurate, Money lion is a one stop shop for all of yours banking needs"
gordon,Very easy to use. All transactions go very smoothly. I would recommend moneylion to everyone above all other payday advances
shawn,Money lion is really helpful when you need cash before payday
Ash ,50$ is okay but charging 5$ for a fast transaction is sadly not okay.  99% of people who use these apps are already poor and just need a little help. On top of this you can only take 50$ so imagine trying too take 50$ 5 times now I just paid 25$ extra due too how many times I had too withdraw.
william,"I use money lion, it helps when I need it."
Molly B,"They have been there for me every step of the way, for over 2 years now."
Martha Holmes,I like that it's a quick way to get cash instantly when I'm in need of a payday advance. The problem I've come across so far is that my bank account continuously unlinks and when I relink it I no longer have the maximum instacash advance amount I'm allowed ($345). I've only been able to get $75.
Customer ,"I love this app, its been very helpful when i need extra cash. And instantly transfers to my account, would definitely recommend to everyone"

Nicole Buffinet,I love the fact I have some extra cash for emergencies  when using insta cash
Chris,"Great concept and idea, I just don’t like the fact they charge almost $5 for instant transfer AND still ask for a tip"
Shannon Collier,This is an amazing program.  The fees are a lot if you need it ASAP.  I use when I need the extra cash so i already don’t have the cash I don’t need more taken away.  I understand though
araceli,I have always enjoyed moneylion. Just knew thing is that the amount you can request at one needs to more then 50$ .

William B.,It's awesome
chris ziegler,Great app! Helps me save and Invest!
penny,"Money lion is a great app I was crunching down the day before payday and wanted to buy something I didn’t realize I was out of cash in my roar money acc so the transaction was declined , but with no over draft fee money lion gave me some insta cash and on I went. If this app could link to everything like a bank card like chime does it would be 5 stars for me thanks ML!"
george,"amazing, got part of my advance."
trista,Great company! Plenty of boosts!
Not to happy,I love using this app. Instacash has helped me through tight spots and I love the credit builder loans that are offered.
Kristin N Truckey,Great app! Fast delivery of funds
miryam,The fees are to high and the fact that you can only take out $50 makes you spend mor money on fees and tips. I understand the business model but I think i would be better with higher cash out amount with the same fees
David Buffington,I absolutely love MoneyLion helping me get back on track Financially makes me feel like im about. To start the next level...

Nell ,You have to get this app. It has been super helpful in hard times. Much better than taking out a payday loan
Usama Ihabatah,"This is a great way to get emergency cash when needed.  I did not give 5 stars due to you can only cash out $50 at a time and each time it's a $5 fee for instant. So if you have $125 available and you need that $125, that's three transactions at $5 each. And then they are looking for a tip for each transaction? I only tip once"
leele,i absolutely love money lion. the instacash opportunities have been awesome
Cam N.,"Have had several issues recently, mostly with self advertised instacash boosts and the ""service"" behind them. Refereed a friend via the instacash boost link and didnt recieve my boost. In text chat with support I was blatantly lied to three times (which were later confirmed by an on the phone customer rep that they were lies)Now today I see ""instacash boost up to $50 when you invest $10."" I invested 15...not only no surprise no boost but somehow this transfer isnt instant (despite being in house)."

montrail,I am impressed with the great service and financial options available.
theresa,"It’s a great app if you’re trying to set a budget and get a grip on your expenses, saving Money, also if you’re trying to start building your credit. As far as loans you should be able to get more with direct deposit on instacash. However I Do Not like the fact that I took out a credit builder loan that I needed and it only let me borrow $100.00 and I have to pay $565.00 that defeated the entire point of the loan. The loan process needs to be a little more lenient. Maybe after this loan is payed off it will be more helpful to me in the future if I need it Other than that it’s a great app."
jessica,I needed an advance till payday. They where there for me... thanks for the help!
Dustin Whitfield,"When your major bank eats your cash at a ATM, Money Lion Helps!"
Fareedah Jefferson ,I will never Bank anywhere else the only thing is even if you tip they still charge you 3.99$ to get it fast and only 50$ at a time so it's pretty much the same as any other way of borrowing money. I also use the investment portfolio I really do enjoy that I like the roundups when I use my insta Cash Card those are absolutely wonderful to go straight to my investment portfolio I also have a credit builder loan with them with very reasonable rates and I have seen a significant increase in my credit score as well so all in all I get my direct deposit I have investments I get roundups all in all I wouldn't Bank anywhere else

Keri,"I love the application for funds but, I tried time after time to put a new payment card on file and it wouldn't take it. It kept telling me that my Bank blocked the card or wouldn't approve it. I spoke with the Bank more than once and even changed my debit card and it still won't accept it. I called money lion and no one could help. It's very frustrating. I had to buy cards to make my loan payments. It still will not accept my new cards."
Lex,Absolutely love this app you should really give it a try I get my paycheck 2 days early on here
Corrie,I signed up with Moneylion several months ago and linked my bank account but didn't want to switch over my direct deposits because it's a huge hassle with my employer. I thought I wouldn't be able to make use of Moneylion because of this so I didn't log back in and forgot about it entirely. I recently started looking into opening a second bank account and switching my deposits because of personal reasons and I started to sign up for Moneylion but was informed I already had an account. When I logged back in I was pleasantly surprised with the benefits and offers that I was eligible for before switching anything over. Moneylion is the only bank that has been flexible and generous with their features and I really like how they do things! I will be recommending it to all of my family and friends when they are looking for a change.

selma,Excellent service garented loan
Tina Frederick,Love it! Easy to use and easy to navigate.
javier,Yep and had some Instant Cash very quickly I was worried about having to link my bank account and debit card but from the reviews I've read about moneylion all was well about the only thing I didn't like was the fact that you can only request insta cash in $50 increments that makes it a bit of a pain
Kenneth Crawford,They have been great I’ve been using money lion over a year building my credit and getting money before payday and never had a problem works great
Mary Valued goSeek Customer,Good app it just sucks you can only cash out $50 at a time
TD,Other than the limit of banking options and the instacash being capped at 50$ per request irregardless of authorized limit it's fairly fast and pain free
kenya,"I love money lion, life saver, game changer"
tiara,"They've been there when I needed them. I do wish that instacash would let you withdraw more then $50 at one time though. The fees do stack up, which sucks."
Chris Castleberry,MoneyLion has helped me in a pinch every month. The company I work for only pays once a month and it's hard to make that check stretch but my account with MoneyLion has helped tremendously.
Dannielle,Took almost 3months for me to get approval but I'm thankful for the benefits plus instacash
cassondra,"Money lion does not pay attention to your pay days, and withdraw your money causing overdraft fees. The system needs a reminder text and or the option to change the date."

neo,"I was scammed by a fake moneylion account on Instagram and am being targeted by more like it, on top of that moneylion charged me twice and is not only refusing to give it back but they're trying to hold me responsible even tho I have proof of this and now they've locked me out of my moneylion account! Also even tho I was being as civil as I could be one of their customer support agents just hung up on me! I'm beyond upset, I'm homeless and live in a women's shelter in Portland and I've been thru hell I don't need this! Moneylion you are crooks!.... ² So it just takes a bad review to get your attention? Why didn't you just say so? Ok, first of all victim shaming is not only SUPER classy but professional as well! And u now suggest I reach out thru your social media for help? You've GOT to be f**king joking right? Ok sure, which one of your Instagram accounts should I try, there's only 40 or 50 at least? Should I try messaging the one where ""moneylion"" claims I've won $2021 or should I try the one that called me a goat and said such vulgarity it should belong in a porn mag? I take responsibility for being naive and not thinking on this one but with as many fake profiles these ppl have made I know this can't be the first you've heard of this and there's got 2 b more victims.Also i DID reach out to both you & Instagram to get help with this but nothing! There's no such thing as REAL live support anymore! I had always paid back apps on time and was hoping to raise my credit score so that I could put a roof over my head and get my mom and I an apartment together but instead I've had to borrow again right after paying them all back just to pay all the motels I've had to stay bcuz I had nowhere 2 go and bcuz the shelters here in Portland are overloaded unless I wanted to pitch a tent out here downtown and there's just so many of the mentally ill homeless that no one cares about one more, there was just no help just like now, there's only greed and blaming and pretty much just ""oh well you're screwed lady hope u learned your lesson!"" I've been so stressed I lost my hair and am now super thin and was in fear of being less than a day away from the streets where it's more like an insane asylum for ppl who took too many drugs and now this bs? Yeah I was gullible and desperate but the links and messages looked pretty legit just like the real Moneylion so they did their homework,guess i shoulda just did mine or at least remembered to change my login info immediately but I didn't, so in a nutshell moneylion are you saying that I deserved this? Let me know and in the meantime I hope that $205 that you wrongfully took from me is doing more for you than it could've for me since I've been broke since before I even woke up on payday, without a damn cigarette to calm me down or unable to buy food when I work late and miss dinner at the women's shelter, no, not a bunch of made up bs this is %100 truth and idk how hard you have to work for your $ but I'm a housekeeper at a residential home for the disabled so what I do IS  hard work therefore I shouldn't have had to beg you for my own money back or my bank to hurry up with their ""provisional"" money that I still have yet to receive or for you to at least let me get an Instacash loan that someone else got to cash in on from MY loyalty and on time payments that I earned! It's almost like you're siding WITH the bad guys,except to me you're one of them also! And great customer service btw,speaking of your rep just hanging up on me for being angry yet in a civil manor demanding answers? And because I had to change my debit card,now all my other payday apps have encountered more bugs they need to fix,they all started me over even tho my accounts still the same and charging me  new member fees again so I was looking at a $10 advance from other apps I use like DAVE when used to be $100! God Bless the good ppl from Earnin, they're truly #1! They are always so quick 2 help and fix my issues, they raised my max rather than decrease it like Cleo, Dave and KLOVER who just snatched up the $10  i had borrowed and b4 I even got across street to buy lunch at work it was gone and wasn't even due till TOMORROW! trust them folks to ever get your payback date correct EVERYTIME, double check! Am I bitter? Yes, do I sound a little bit like someone who's snapped? Yup! U would too if you've been in my shoes not to mention that my bank Rivermark CCU who has done everything they can to assure they get at least 1 to 2 $30 overdraft fees outta me each pay period even when the apps have a different post date they push em on thru anyways so that they can charge me for it which in hence is making me look irresponsible and likely to keep me and mom homeless even longer so thanks for the HELP Moneylion,Instagram,Rivermark! You got my referrals! 👍_In Instagram Type moneylion in searchbar to 👀 and I got screenshots to prove it all if anyone's interested in helping me stop them!"
Black Babadook,❤️❤️❤️ love it

Amanda Sleek,Great service and lots of patients with paybacks
Troy Miller,This app is always there when I need it!!!
Demetrius Person,So awesome! Got instacash and then a boost! Das wassuh
Lauren Lack,Too much of a hassle to get approved for a credit builder loan and a pain in the rear end to even sign up for the credit builder. I also ended up getting denied for a purchase with my debit card with money in the account so yeah I’m very very very unimpressed with this garbage  app. It’s kind of like cash app letting someone fraudulently use my account and then told me they’re not gonna give me the money back. Scumbags
katie,Because cause the loan amounts never are the same even though my direct deposit dollar amount has never changed. What I can borrow always decrease.
shonni,"I borrowed cash from moneylion and my experience in doing that has always been very satisfied, thanks!"

Ed D,"Primary bank account doesn't show up in instacash. I find this disturbing, since it does show up in my wallet, and is linked to my money Lion account.

customer,This is best bank that I have ever used. Super easy and quick direct deposit. The ATM search option so you aren’t charged taking money out is awesome. The instant cash option prior to your checks (in case you need extra cash prior to your payday) is amazing.

victor smith,They are very helpful
Jacqueline Gallo,very helpful when you're running low on cash. and they'll even let you differ your repayment by up to 2 weeks if you contact them
Donna Williams,This bank has helped build my credit and offering loans i normally wouldnt qualfy for. 4 stars customer service isnt as eager to resolve disputes as i would like are reluctant and make you jump through hoops before issuing reimbursement Unlike your traditional bank. The money isnt coming out of your pockets guys...you just work there. Other than that?? Ace!
irishea,Someone hacked my account and having a very hard time getting this fixed. Not happy at all!!  😡😡
Christian G,"Really easy. Good rates and they boost your cash advance availability pretty fast so you actually know your on time payments and instacash are acknowledged and rewarded. It’s a life saver for anyone who lives paycheck to almost next paycheck, like me. Or anyone who finds themselves in any financial emergency. Credit doesn’t matter though they do have a program to help you build your credit. It’s simple to navigate, quick, and just pretty great all around."

J Gatchalian,I think that as a business moneylion has only grown and the features they offer are truly helpful in my everyday day life. I'm very thankful for moneylion. Couldn't be more happy to call this my primary banking choice.
Clip,I absolutely love this app every time I need cash I now know that it’s available.. I started out with $90 and then they increased it to $165 within two weeks… I get my money within seconds I have an option to tip if I choose.. I highly recommend downloading this app if you need to borrow a couple dollars until payday..
kasi,"I've been With Money Lion for 2 years, from Texas to California. The banking system they created was one of the best platform so far, compare to the Off the main stream Bank.Properly one of the best prepaid -online card services.The only thing that makes me give it 4/5 because It didn't accept other online banking as a main account So I didn't qualify to get a credit builder. As I paid off the first loan. I couldn't get the second one because I no longer using the branch Bank.Overall, you got to the right place. This ML is all you can count on🤝"
joan,Great service. Only downfall is you can only request $50 at a time and each fast cash request costs you 4.99 - not terrible but also it’s clear where they’re making their money.
kashandra,Money Lion is always there when I need them.Nice to have an app that's got my back!!
felicia,"I found this app one morning when I was dead broke but needed money very badly. Even though I was a few weeks late on my first repayment ever, they’ve never held that against me. I really appreciate that & love doing business with them. Out of all the lending apps I’ve used/use, they are head & shoulders above the rest. Can’t wait to receive my physical debit card."
james,So far since starting with Moneylion I have had no problems. Their app is extremely simple to use and comes in handy especially for that being paid biweekly lifestyle!
mason,Lifesavers and great easy to work with’
zachary,So easy to use and I love how they work with you if your payment is late.
Shameika,"Easy to use , helpful and they're always there when I need help"
michael,Love it. Not only do I get money when I need it but it's also helping me with my credit.
keith,To many 3rd parties used to cobble together the MoneyLion App.
melissa,I love money lion and it helps me when I need an extra boost of cash before my next payday.
DeCarlos,This is by far the best of the few apps like this available right now. I love the variety of services available and set up was a breeze. I gave only three stars due to the fact that the Insta cash feature is deceivingly expensive. Zero APR is true however the other fees associated set an actual APR over 500%.First time I used this feature cash was instantly deposited into my bank account for a fee And deposits are capped at $50 regardless of amount available to you I’m assuming to charge you an additional fee. Tips are not required but changing the default tip Will take a couple of attempts if you’re not paying attention you will pay an automatic high tip amount. The second time I used this feature after having set up a money roar account Money was deposited into that account not my bank making the instant part useless and a waste of money for the additional fees since it takes two days to transfer to your bank. To summarize great app highly recommend it is slightly expensive and does need some fine-tuning.
denise,"Moneylion is an awesome, reliable app that helps you manage your finances and learn more about how you can improve your financial situation. I prefer them way over my local financial institution!"
jessica,Great to use love it
Vernell Sheppard,The are useless when you need help and only want to charge you for your money. Instacash is a rip off. Only 50 at a time. Yeah so they can charge you five dollars every time.
Trillian Lynn Stanton,There’s just great and responds in a timely manner.
james,"Absolutely the worst ever. Do not use their credit builder (""credit blower"" is more like it) product When you pay it off they automatically send a late pay to all 3 credit bureaus! Twice this happened to me causing a combined hit of over 120 points to my score and erasing all my hard work over 12 month period during a pandemic and economic downturn no less!!! I believed them the first time when they said it was a system glitch and took them up on the second offer. Nope! It happened like clockwork again when I paid off the loan. I have filed complaints with the federal government, CFPB, OCC, Texas Attorney General office as this a blatant violation of UDAAP. This has cost me thousands of dollars and housing approvals! Moneylion is scamming people and forcing them to stay in a certain credit tier. Investigate Rohit Chopra! Predatory lender. AVOID!"
tashia,Money lion comes in handy for me with the instant   cash it’s always right on time I couldn’t ask for a better app
james,Greatest thing ever. So helpful! Love it! Highly recommend!
Billy Battes,Very helpful with surprise bills and extra money when needed.

brendan,I love money lion they are very flexible and have so many valueable features that are very benefical they do what they can to make life easier

Jennifer Howard,Great service and easy to use.
robert,"Love ❤️ MoneyLion! So many wonderful tools like “⚡️Instacash” when you need extra funds in between paydays. Receive your paycheck 2 days early when you ACH your salary into your “RoarMoney” bank account, invest in stocks, build credit with their “MoneyLion Plus Loans” and love the articles talking about investing and preparing for your financial future. They also have “Shake Rewards” which is a FUN way to be rewarded when you use your ML debit card for purchases. The rewards go directly into your ML invest account. It’s a wonderful app! Love how they add new tools and services to help you save money."

I've had a great relationship with them over the years. I would give  five stars however there have been some glitches  that were very inconvenient, however I know as I continue to do business with them these minor issues will be dealt with. Overall it has been a great experience."

Maria ,"I had to call Customer Service 3 times to dispute unauthorized activity on my accounts before a ticket was finally created. I've also attempted numerous times to reset my password, but still haven't received an email with the change password link. In addition, I have also not received any correspondence regarding my disputes. Obviously, it was fraud because the charges were made to an Apple Store in freaking HONG KONG!!!!DO BETTER MONEYLION!"
rodney,"I give it 3 stars because you ask for tip pulse fees .. I have to pay 2 fees because you won’t let me borrow my limit ,, I pay a fee to borrow $50 and another fee for $25 .. why cant I borrow $75 so I can just pay one fee .. ?"
Liberty E,"Moneylion was a easy app to understand, offers many different useful things you would want in a banking app. Customer service was pleasant and efficient very knowledgeable, I have and will recommend moneylion to family and friends."
john,"I really needed help, and from once a company that says they’re going to loan you money loan it to me and when I pay back the first amount they increased it. I’m glad they had faith in me, I would like for them people to advertise on their account that lend more money to be honest, but that is not their company. I need a loan to pay off my credit cards from Covid, everybody says they’re going to give you $1000-$2500 but they never do. This company did not do that, they gave me exactly what they said they were going to give me, opened up A digital debit card and sent me one in the mail, and also let me invest in stocks which I actually made a little money on. LOL and all I was saying other than the advertisers on their page, this company is great!"
Jack Crincoli,I have always paid my loan back on time and paying off my credit builder I don't understand why you lowered my instacash. That put me in a hole and not happy AT ALL
Andrea Godinez,"Needed money for emergency, money lion sent the money into my account within 4 hours thank you"
Michael Houston,MoneyLion RoarMoney is the Best Online Bank with 5* Features. This Bank has helped me rebuild my credit over the years! MoneyLion has so much to offer over any bank hands down! I’m a long time MoneyLion Member and would Highly Recommend to each and every community Nationwide.
Elizabeth Woods,"It’s a great emergency service however the fees are a bit excessive when using the instant cash feature. To use instant cash you can borrow in increments of $5- $50 until you reach the max they have for you. When you borrow you tip them “the amount you think is fair” with the automatic defaults tip is $5, but you can alter it to any amount including $0. However when you do select $0 you get to a screen that says you didn’t tip and it requests that you leave a tip. They provide you with a card to use for instant cash and adding direct deposits, but there’s a charge of $3.99 to have the instant cash funds transferred to that card (in addition to the tip). Example- borrow $50 + $5 default tip+ $3.99 transfer to the card they provide fee. Repayment amount = $58.99)You can also transfer the money to your personal debit card for $4.99. The transfer fees don’t exist if you transfer to you checking account but that takes a few business days to arrive and in an emergency you need funds quicker than that."

Christopher Knapp,I have been very pleased with my services from Money Lion so far l!

daniel,This app in my opinion give the highest cash advance called *Instacash* among the different apps that's out there and this app also has credit builder loan you can take out to build or rebuild one's credit and the app rewards and gives incentives for repaying your Instacash cash advance on time by increasing the amount you'll eligible for next cash advance

Jen,Always super helpful! Comes in clutch. Wish I could choose my own payment date sometimes. I get paid on twice a month
Tina G.🌺,"This company is great to extend, they don't always make it easy to access someone to talk to you, or they are delayed on reaponding to emails that it sometimes not worth sending. They do work with you when things coming up which I say is amazing, because with someone who has major medical issues and have medical bills like crazy they really help out when you can get ahold of someone. So 4 out of 5."
Andres Gonzalez,Money lion is great! The loan low interest rate. Has many benefits also. It is worth investing!
Kazzy,i dont understand if you need the cash now how do you get it?? it takes so many days and is soooooooooo confusing this app kinda sucks
fatman pat,I NEED EMERGENCY CASH AND THE MONEY LION WAS THERE. THE PRICES PER MONEY BOOST IS EXTREMELY HIGH AND THEY ASK FOR A TIP. I WISH I COULD TAKE THE WHOLE MONEY BOOST AT ONE TIME INSTEAD OF $50 increments THAT CHARGES $5 PER TRANSACTION. OTHER THAN THAT I LOVE IT.

samantha,"Great options to keep you financially positive and allows you to rebuild or build your credit history.  The ability or option to also invest and the addition of cryptocurrency will assist everyone in getting to a financially stable future. Keep up the good work, but consider partner with an investor or a speaker to give an understanding of the stock market and a general understanding of how the market impacts the stocks people own for highs & lows."

WILLIAM KNARR,Money Lion really helps when needed most!
mary,"Great experience with MoneyLion. I have to admit everything about this app has been positive. Ease of use and very intuitive layout. Don’t really have to look for anything, always loads and updates quickly, customer service is automated up to a point, but mostly any issue can be handled through there and if not it will escalate you to a human. It’s a great dashboard if you have multiple accounts and allows for easy and instant money transfers with low fees. Then on top of all the other perks you’ll find they also loan you a few hundred interest free. I always tip, a few bucks tip to borrow $250 - that’s pretty cool they do that. They have a credit builder program that works. Really works as I’m working toward a permanent solution to financial obstacles. No bandaids.If you need a cash account for personal spending and tracking look no further."
Currently User,Love the app but wish you could get your whole ammount allowed at one time. I feel like i spend to much paying 4.99 everytime i get 50 dollars. If im allowed 370 i should be able to get it all at once that way i only spend 4.99 one time i might even be more likely to leave a tip if i only had to spend that fee one time. Thanks just my thoughts and my only flaw i see with the app.
caleb,"I love how MoneyLion is always there when I need them. When I need extra cash, they’re there."
Veronica N Eng,Great banking resource! Better than any mobile banking I’ve tried!
ANITA WEBSTER,I love MoneyLion. They have been absolutely amazing and helped when I really needed them. I also started a loan to help improve my credit. I really like them and highly recommend them. I wish I could give them more than 5 stars. I have had 0 issues with them so I’ve never had to call customer service. Their app is very put together and everything is easy to find! If you need some money to get you by try them out! You won’t regret it and you will continue to use them!!
james,They have always been there when I’ve needed them!!
Chuck,Great App Try It.

blair,"I can honestly say that Moneylion is the best financial organization I have worked with. Not only do tHey have a great smartphone interface for accessing your account information, they actually offer great financial assistance tools if you are in a pinch. Their InstaCash loan is one the best products in the marketplace!! Very easy process to apply and get your cash in minutes!!  Moneylion is a true lifesaver!!!"
Jasmin Cottle,My husband referred me and ive had no problem using instant cash but for some reason he was able to use 50 and paid it off woth 5 extra insta cash leftover yet now after the referral he has nothing. And it been a week and he hadnt been given any update.
Nique,This is the best app that I've ever used in my life! As me and my husband have been together since we were teenagers we got wild not thinking about credit and this app not only helped my mother but has helped me out tremendously I would highly recommend this app for anyone who was looking to build their credit and earn extra cash
garry,Always fast and convenient. Never any issues
Omer Iqbal,"The customer service is deplorable bordering on fraudulent. I had a credit builder loan payment due on June 28th. I got paid on June 23rd and wanted to get all of my bills paid. I scheduled a payment. Suddenly it’s brought to my attention that my June Auto Payment was still scheduled to come out on June 28th automatically and the June payment I scheduled to pay early on June 23rd is scheduled to come out the next day on June 29th. When I spoke to customer service they told me they couldn’t cancel a pending payment. After it cleared my account is listed as past due. I paid my June 28th payment. I don’t understand how I can be past due when my next payment was due July 28th. Customer Service tells me that I have no payments scheduled for July. They say I had a payment due June 28th and 29th. Which is ridiculous. I looked over my loan agreement which clearly states 1 payment a month on the 28th. I can not be late for a payment that is not due for another 23 days from today. My instacash has been paused due to a missed payment that I didn’t miss. My good standing has been destroyed because I made a payment early NOT LATE early. There is literally no bank, heck there’s no good company in the world that wouldn’t correct this mistake in a second. It’s easy to see I did try to pay my July payment before my June payment. Agents are telling me I never had a July payment scheduled so they can’t change it. Again, my loan agreement states 1 payment due monthly on the 28th of the month. This is criminal. I will be contacting the BBB and my attorney if it’s not corrected."
Claytor Tammy,I'm glad y'all don't do credit checks and it was so easy to get a little cash until payday! Thanks for the help!

Gary R,Great app full of financial advice and features plus loans and quick cash when u need it!! Moneylion is one of my favorite apps!! They are always a great help!!
Brandon Webster,I just really don't understand how any of y'all work in the banking industry you know nothing you're supposed to offer a credit builder loan but how is it that you ruined my credit even more with it  it just don't make sense to me at all it is ridiculous you got poor customer service man the whole experience has been terrible with you guys I'm just going to be honest with you and I'm looking for somewhere else to bank now I'm just going to tell you like that
Sherwin Gaston,I like Money lion it's a big help since pandemic.

bryan,It’s extremely helpful funds in a time of need.
nelson,Easy to use and easy to access great for when your in a bind and need cash until payday
Shadrick,"Overall, I’ve been happy with all the features of MoneyLion. I use Chime for my bill pay since I started out with it first, and then found out about MoneyLion. It has plenty of excellent features, including tips on building your credit, third party loan offers, credit score checks, investment portfolios, and of course the great Instacash, and more.  But I’ve found them to not be consistent with how they work the due date or the amount of the loan on that. On July 2, for instance, I borrowed $50, and it didn’t even surprise me when the due date was July 2. I just rolled my eyes in my head thinking here we go again. It does no good to message them because they always have some technical reason for why it’s done what it did, and you gotta live with it, like it or not. However, I tried again later and it did what it’s supposed to do, due date next month when I get paid.  Last month it was so messed up I tried to get them to explain to me why the due date is due only a few days later instead of when I get paid on the first and I never did understand the person’s reasoning, I think they’re trained to talk so techie that you just have no room to argue and have to accept it. I did get them to move the due date to the 28th, since we get our check two days early.  Shouldn’t MoneyLion know they get my direct deposit two days early each month?  You’d think.  But my dd didn’t come in on the 28th and I thought it was rude of them to pull what payment they could out of Chime (I didn’t have the full amount in Chime at that time of the month). Them doing that caused a transaction from a lender to be declined from insufficient funds. I do feel that since MoneyLion knows exactly when they receive my monthly dd, they could’ve been more respectful and waited for it to arrive rather than take what money they could get out of my other bank, causing me stress. The bottom line though, MoneyLion has many helpful and excellent features for the consumer, and in my opinion, they need to work on consistency with the Instacash feature so as to prevent all the unnecessary stress for the consumer."
John Haulotte,"Fast and reliable, I would recommend to anyone. Thank you MoneyLion!"
Ebony Collins,"Somebody changed the phone number on my account and then made a bunch of insta cash advances of $100 and then paid it back using my linked debit card and then took out a bunch more advances and then did that once more. Over $1700 in advances were made and over a thousand dollars of it repaid from my checking account. I called and reported this right as I saw it. After getting off the phone with the support lady I saw an email that said the phone number on my account 585-540-0923 was used to connect to a different account and was then disconnected from my account. I told the lady on the phone several times that that was NOT my phone number. So why, after I reported this was this phone number allowed to connect to another account?! How is that now flagged as suspicious activity?I have so many questions. After this person changed the phone number and then immediately after started making instacash withdrawals, why wasn’t that flagged as suspicious activity? And after they paid back the advances and then made MORE advances, why was that not flagged as suspicious activity? When they used all of the advanced funds to make two large purchases from a place in Hong Kong WHY WAS THAT NOT FLAGGED AS SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY? When they changed the phone number on my account, why didn’t I get an email? Why was there no two step authentication? I need answers. They took everything."
elizabeth HAYES,Opga booga is ooga bugga
Craig Crawford,Fast and extremely efficient. I would recommend their services to my friends
RJ,Is good ya very helpful service indeed
Zulma Cardounel,"I recommend Moneylion to everyone! I discovered the app and it’s creditbuilder loan with one day left to make my rent payment. The whole process took a few minutes and at midnight on a weekend I had the exact amount I was short deposited into my BB&T checking account. The instacash feature is just an added bonus and helps me more than I’d like to admit. If I could give 100 stars, I’d do it!"
holly,"Help when ever you need it with no hassle. No complications I have been with them a couple months and received more help then my two banks put togther in very little time, I would recommend moneylion to any and everybody.

OD,The best account ever
Raul Gonzalez,Money lion is great! The payday advance really comes in help when needed!
brendan,I love the app it's easy and great. However the fees for instacash are outrageous compared to Earnings app. That and I deposit enough money into my account my instacash should be higher.
johnathan,Love it so much!!!!!
G Best,"Tips are high, like an ""option"" not interest... But you have to tip to receive help."

KHaOS,I gave this 1 star because moneylion isn’t allowing me to access more instacash of $400. It keeps saying restart app

sean,"My ""Moneylion"" Roarmoney Account By MetaBank Has Truthfully, 100% Honestly Been Nothing But A ""Real-Life"", Lifesaver & The Fact That They Offer, 0% Interest ""Instacash"" For The Unexpected In These Trying Times..It Was A Complete- ""No-Brainer For Me, To Switch To ""Moneylion"" Financial Institution To Handle ALL My Financial Needs. ....*Thank You, ""Moneylion""*...."

marvin johnese,"Moneylion Is by far my favorite bank! Great Customer Service, Quick to responses if something is wrong. Many GREAT benefits etc"
valarie,Thank you for always being there for me! It’s been almost a year I been a loyal customer with instacash who always payback my loans on time or early! Only thing I don’t like is when customer specialist leave you on hold for 5 to 6 minutes & your only reaching out with a simple request they should already know the answer to. Yesterday a specialist told me I was no longer eligible to use instacash I was only calling to report a BUG issue with app! Not sure why he would lie to me!
Dustin Webb,You're  always  there when I need you keep  up the great  work
Nkryptd Kreations,Always available when I need it in a pinch. No hi interest rates amount owed doesn't change or increase if you have to miss a payment. You  choose the amount  of payment and pay date. Definitely comes in handy. Now if only i could get my card to work right.
cleo,Great resource and very generous. Handy when you need extra cash in a pinch without worry about interest fees.
Tracy Peebles,"When I need a few dollars to cover my expenses, MoneyLion has came through. Their ability to make funds available and repayment less about money and more about repaying debt is why I use their services. I would recommend them to anyone who has a need for access to funds whenever they need a few dollars to cover expenses that their paychecks can't."
luis,"It really puts the ""bud"" in the budget!  So helpful and useful!"
john,"Just wished y'all were there to back me up when I got sick with the Covid. Sadly, when I was out of work for 30 days and not paid, My direct deposit schedule was reset and I lost the #1 thing Moneylion promotes....Instacash...."
Saint Dervareid D. Hawkins ,Moneylion is always there when I need a little help. It's a great app that I'm glad I came across. Good job Moneylion
blake,This is an awesome app. I recommend it very very well informed app and you should download right now.
Melody,"InstaCash is wonderful but they rip people off with their fee charging. The highest increment available is 50.00 so if you're eligible for say 400.00 you have to take eight 50.00 advances at 4.99 ea to get the advance with turbo. People should be able to get a single advance for whatever amount they're eligible for. This ""glitch"" is why I seldom give a tip."
Nikki,Love this app its a life saver for sure i would definitely recommend this app to everyone that needs a little extra cash to hold them over until payday
Kayla Cagle,Really awsome!! Super cool!
jamie,Really user friendly! Just wish it would try to make you use it for direct deposits! Still allow the big advance as long as you have steady income
customer,Awesome app EASILY TO UNDERSTAND AND EASILY TO WORK WITH
joe donnelly,Money Lion is the best. Will always come right on time.
theresa,"Great way to get extra money, gives to a timely manner to pay back! Great service would definitely recommend!!"

Madison Jones,Excellent service for when you need it - especially if your struggling with low credit score.
Heather Smith,I like MoneyLion but I feel you should not charge a fee to get instant cash since you pay fees for this account. In addition I feel you should not ask for a tip considering you are being charged to get the boost instantly.
Catherine,I have only a great experience with MineyLion they have taught me so much about finances
devon,"I enjoy the fact that , I have the money lion as a friend that i can loan from when funds are short"

Evita Rucker,"Okay. So, the only thing I DID NOT LIKE (only thing) was that the loan I applied For, it was paid out in a half now, half when u pay the loan off.  I didnt Fully comprehend how the system worked but…. That instaCash comes in CLUTCH."

bobbie,I never have a issues MoneyLion is the best
justun,"Charging $5 for instacash isn’t free.  Asking for a tip when charging $5 is crazy.  Making me request $50 at a time makes it expensive.Reply from MoneyLionAn hour agoInstacash funding is FREE if you choose standard delivery, which takes only 24-48 hours. If you need your Instacash extra fast, you can choose instant Turbo funding for $4.99 (or $3.99 if you have our RoarMoney bank account). The Turbo fee is totally optional and just helps us cover the cost of delivering your cash advance instantly when you’re in a pinch. We appreciate your feedback, and if you have any other questions, please feel free to contact us directly.Instant Cash isn’t instant if you have to wait 2 business days.  It would be 2 business day cash.  The cast for instant payments through a debit card is .50 cents.  You charge $4.99.  I do enjoy the service. I would rate it 5 stars and recommend it to all of f my family and friends if I would choose how much I needed up to my instant cash limit.  I would be willing to tip every single time if the fee wasn’t already profitable for money lion.  You are close to having a great product.  All your doing now is limiting your growth and popularity while letting someone create a service to directly compete with you and make it theirs.  All cabs and ride shares are called Uber now.  All tissue is called Kleenex.  You could own the instant cash market.  Lyft did economy ride share first.  Uber came up with Uber x as a response.  Now it’s all referred to as ubering by the consumer.  Good luck city and thank you for helping me out."
patricia,Great app over all and it has helped me many time's.
SYBIL,Best ever I was really glad to come across money lion
wanda bowden,"This app has been very helpful in hard times, I would recommend this app for rainy days!"
Sonya,"The MoneyLion app is very useful and from my experience as a member over these past many months, I feel comfortable saying that it feels like an above-board operation, which is a diamond in the rough when it comes to small-dollar finance."

Monique Espino,This company is pretty impressive and helpful!!
KRC,Great decision I love it it helps out alot
chad,"MoneyLion overall is a very resourceful and helpful tool to have in emergencies, however, the fees are outrageous. You have to pay a processing fee for every amount you withdraw, not to mention, MoneyLion claims tipping is optional but if you choose not to tip for an amount you withdraw, the next time you try to borrow money, a screen will pop up stating you didn’t leave a tip the last time and it forces you to tip the company before you’re able to withdraw more money. The company shouldn’t claim that tipping is optional when you really don’t have a choice. I pay about an additional $70-$80 every week due to processing fees and tips and that is absolutely ridiculous.In response to MoneyLion’s reply: Nobody wants to wait 2 days for standard delivery because nobody takes out a payday loan unless it is for an immediate emergency. And you are 1000% lying about optional tipping, there was no way for me to exit out of that prompt without leaving you all a tip (the prompt literally said, “Whoops, looks like you didn’t leave us a tip last time. Tipping allows us to continue to deliver your funds with 0%APR.” with a button at the bottom of the screen FORCING me to tip $3). I’ve already gone back and forth with one of your employees about this as well as how you give incorrect dates of when money will be deposited into your RoarMoney account (screenshots were provided for this). I use to work in the payday/installment loan industry and it’s behaviors like the ones your company displays that has made these loans illegal in my state."
Ebony Morris,"Excellent App once it works. Had to reach out to customer service to fix many issues BUT not only did they fix them all, they responded and acted quickly. Definitely would recommend."
Dawn R. Fogle,"Great product, I'm please with its easy use and the funds transfer process is exceptional!"
Carol Alexander,moneylion is great when you're in a pinch before payday and need some funds and they don't even charge you a bunch of fees when you pay it back
Valued Customer,Very good company to do business with. Very helpful.
francisco,"I love money lion ,I can always count on them to get an advance and if your in good standing with the they give you extra , I also love that after you have paid them back you can borrow again right away , I consider them to be a great company that always has your back , and goes out of their way to help you ,thank you money lion you are the best."

Rebecca Cathers,Easy access Very helpful and when you pay back same day have access to more money no waiting love moneylion
Kayla Johnson-Giordano,"Love this app. You can get money between paychecks, and also take out small loans to help build your credit. Would highly recommend."
Ac,"MoneyLion has been my go to bank for years! I am immensely grateful for the financial services they provide, such as insta cash and credit builder loans. My one issue is the inability to connect to other banks."
jessica,I love the borrowing convenience and the app is super easy to navigate!!!
Rosey Denise,Love this app! Works great if you are unable pinch between paydays!
Mr gamer Awesome,"Moneylion has helped me financially SO MUCH in the past year, it's awesome, especially the Instacash paycheck advance option! It also makes investing in the stock market super easy for Novices like me, starting with only $5. The only thing that possibly could make Moneylion any better in assisting someone financially, is if they incorporated a no fee overdraft option where they'd spot $25 or $50 via Roarmoney debit card for purchases only, not cash, when things might be a little tight those few days before payday - for those that have Direct Deposit into their Roarmoney account each month, which would automatically pay the overdraft amount back with option of tip. Otherwise I think Moneylion is pretty perfect. Thank you for everything so far Moneylion, I super appreciate it!  💛🦁💛"
Corinna Tucker,I think it's great would recommend 🙂
jean,Has really helped me turn my credit around and keep me on track for my bills. Great bank
Tasha Anderson,Love the App and Support helps with everything and some glad I could join
Katelyn Grandin,MoneyLion is awesome! It’s nice to have a ZERO percent apr instacash security blanket to fall back on in case unexpected expenses pop up not to mention the credit builder loan which I have used multiple times. I love this company. I highly recommend them. I have recommended them to nearly everyone I know. If you’re not using their service you’re missing out. This is NOT some payday loan predatory business looking to profit off your misery. This is a company w a heart. Give it a try.
Kevion Robinson,this app is amazing allowed me To instantly get cash that I needed for my gas tank .
Kevon Brown,Great service.  Very dependable. Only downsides is you are charged fees for every $50 you borrow so if you borrow $100 you get hit with all the fees twice and the fees are kind of high.
bwey,"Easy, convenient, and no hassle. Thank you"
David Black,Money Lion is awesome. It makes taking care of my finances so easy and I love Instacash that helps me out if I run short between paydays.
Wiz Kid,MoneyLion has been a good alternative online bank. The instacash is nice but only getting the limit of 50 dollar increments is wrong. At least up it to 100 at a time. The fees add up when you need more then 50..Thank you
Michael Peery,Absolutely Love all the Financial tips to help you be better with Money!!!!
Haydee Leon,Thanks.... 😊
Cody Clouse,Always dependable. Never any glitches. Surprise amount increases. Always helping me in a time of need.
Brian Magadan,"MoneyLion and I have been together since 2018 and even though we have had to work through some kinks, I must say it is MoneyLion who offers the most assistance and in so many different ways at an affordable price!!! They truly do care for a customer and improving their situation and not trying to forever bury them in ridiculous fees. Thank you MONEYLION!!!"
melissa johnson,Very easy and simple process. Highly recommend!

Lindsey Wade,"Love it , get extra cash when u need it"
Keisha,"I've been very happy with MoneyLion ever since I first signed up. While there are some glitches every now and then, it's been great getting my direct deposits a day early and being able to get clear snapshots of my spending habits."
Blake Meyer,Excelent for me
Norman ,Love the app and easy to use very helpful
crystal,Great but insta cash should be 100 not 50 at a time
Shayne Daney,Moneylion s great I have not had any problems with them and they gave me an opportunity when many others didn't.
Angie Minarik,I enjoy this site really easy to use you get the money you need when you need it money is easy to payback comes out on your pay schedule so that's really cool but I would recommend Money Lion
Demetrius,The fees are too high for instant pay (4.99 per $50 debit) and they want a tip on top of the fee. You can only withdraw $50 at a time so they capitalize on more fees per transaction. This is supposed to be for people who need help financially and Money Lion just fees you to death. They also always try to debit money from my checking account before my paycheck hits. Usually around 1 in the morning on payday. There are better apps and options out there that allow you to deduct more than $50 at a time and do not have these exorbitant fees and ask for a tip five times for each transaction. Almost exploitative of people in need of help.
carmen,There always there when you need a Advance to pay what I own Or helps out with any expensive
Oliver Reynolds,Because I have to transfer the money into my account it won't go straight into my account and it takes almost 3 days or more to go into my account I don't see why I can't go straight into my account it's got to go into money line card and then into my account I don't use my money line card
William,ILove the fact that money lion is super quick on their transactions
Tijuan Paramore,MoneyLion is amazing... And they are so much different than these other companies that false advertise and scam you outta your money... MoneyLion actually gives you a chance regardless of credit history and everything..you do have to build your credit in order to get credit and MoneyLion gives you that chance.
Davey Hollowell,When I needed it the most and no one around me could help MoneyLion did!! Thanks Moneylion
vicki,Awesome and fast services. Best online banking around
Fessy Alexander,"Money  Lion is awesome. There no line or persons to deal with.Just a click of a button, and your loan is in your  account in seconds. They have great tools on saving.They help you build your credit.Dont pass this offer up."
Derek Session,Fast way to build credit...I love the app it is easy to use and customer service always willing to help
Larry Palmer,"Really like this app/ card...or I really want to like it .... Amount ngst a bunch of good qualities It has some downfalls... Not able to hook up my direct depost for some reason... Also they advertise $200 or so in cash advance ... But so far 25 is most I've gotten.. I suppose to get higher ants direct deposit must go to money lion acct... I wonder if maybe that's part of why my direct deposit never seems to take... Idk ..just a guess... Otherwise, I do like app layout/ set up... Really want to like it all ... I will defiantly hang onto it a while longer and hope for the few wrinkles to smooth out. I would defiantly say its worth giving a try"

Cassandra Jones,Money lion where have you been all my life the tools that are used to feed my financial health break it down and gives the tools that all people in all social classes can benefit from
Missy,I was finally able to use these guys and it came at perfect moment. Easy to use and cash was there within a minute.
Miko Wright,Every time I get ready to use instacash my amounts change and my bank account is constantly being unlinked. When I informed them of the problem they deferred a payment that I didn’t authorize and said this was the cause for my funds changing but I couldn’t access instacash before anyway. There’s much better loan apps try Dave or Brigit money lion is Awful!!!
Jason Soto,Been a member for a few years and it's been a great overall experience
Brittany Cagle,MoneyLion is my best app for instacash and credit builder that’s help me build credit way to go MoneyLion keep up the good work

Danni Jay,"I’ve used for almost a year, no issues at all. Fast delivery of funds."
Eric,Excellent card and customer service and ease of use
maren,"The like the fact that it instantly funds money but i have to tip and spend fees to get it. So im paying an additional almost $30 to get some extra funds each time. It would be more sufficient if it was once a month but everytime gets a little costly. If i didnt need it right then, then i wouldnt use this app so i feel the fees to have it sent automatically shouldnt be in place because i cant wait the up to 5 days it says to get it."
Jade Joyner,It was very helpful when I was low on cash or needed a certain amount to finish paying what I had to!!
"LUNSFORD, SCOTT D",Perfect will use again in the future
RUBEn SEGURa,"My only complaint is the moving due date. However, it’s been great!"
King Staxx,I love the MoneyLion insta cash it's great and better and it gives you more cash advances than any of the others that I've seen so far..Also MoneyLion gives you a way to invest your money right in your account and it also has a way to earn cash back on your purchases..
Ronald Johnson,I love this app it helped me so much with so many debts I appreciate it a lot
Jay,They really help me and make it easy to pay back. Thanks
DG,Money Lion is ALWAYS there for me when unexpected things happen. It is a relief to know that during those times I have a lifeline in Money Lion.
william,"I would like to see bigger values like $100 with a fee of  4.99. $ 50, 45 30 20 at 4.99 is a lot. Other than that I love money lion."
Gerald Coppedge,"Hassle Free, Borrowing without BS in between. Money lion is perfect for when your in a Financial Pinch. Would recommend MoneyLion to anyone ."
Undeclining sends,I think they are great. The only thing I don't like is that you can only get up to $50 of your total instacash balance at one time. Besides that I love the app. (Please make chime bank an option for the credit building loan)
kaley,"The best alternative to traditional banking very easy to use, and awesome loan services."
Joy,Excellent card and app. Straightforward and user friendly.
carlos,Totally love this helps out so much when you are either in a bind or just need dome extra cash while building your credit!!!!

rechard,"I wish they would you borrow more than 50.00 a time I have 300.00 available but can only request 50.00 at a time, however I can request everyday.Strange to me"
asyata,"MoneyLion is a lifesaver! I get the cash I need, when I need it, fast and without any gimmicks - truly trustworthy!"

Dennis Henning,This is the real deal.I switched my banking here.they really do offer a lot of things.And its all legit and easy..I glad I switched get more perks here than at my old bank.
Hi,"Instacash was rendered ineligible randomly.  Going from $150 available to to $0 overnight… Without any missed payments, and maintained a weekly direct deposit.  Instacash feature is flakey, which makes me wonder about other aspects of the financial institution."
Angie,They come in handy for a bill or something you got to pay right there they will be there
Lola,They were there for me and my pet this morning needed to rush my kitty to vet and didn’t get paid until Friday and thanks to ML got us on some cash
preston,My only problem I have is that you charge to much for the instant transfer if your gonna make people do it 3 or 4 times they should only have to pay once
Uli,One of the best apps that I have used.
ericwainwright,Great App!!! Great Customer service
ashley,Overcharged my account in June resulting in me needing to instant request cash because your system keeps messing up my repayment dates and threw my account into the negatives. I always get paid the 15th and last day of each month from the same employer for over a year now. The best you could do was defer my payment to July 13th two days before my pay date? I would’ve preferred for it to be deferred an extra two days to match my pay date of July 15th. Don’t think I’ll be using your services anymore.
Ioh ,The only thing that is frustrating is actually talking to someone live. and withdrawing more than the set amount ATM daily.
kendra,Raymond was extremely understanding about why I need to extend my payment date! He got it done right away and was very professional.
anthony,I shouldn’t have to pay $5 every time I want money right away. It’s my money so when I want to borrow $360 I have to pay back over $400 it’s bull sh**
Amanda Brooke Smith,The best money loan app ever! I recommended!
David McGarrah,MoneyLion is great and being a member is an excellent decision. Not only do they allow cash advances to get you through rough times they also offer many more services to assist with your financial goals.
jennifer scott,Never had a problem m they didn't fix asap
brittany,"Love the app and everything it provides. The only thing I would suggest changing, with regards to InstaCash, would be to have the ability to select a different repayment date; or the ability to extend it a week. It’s great that it predicts future deposit dates, however there may be months that it gets moved to the right by a few days. Prompting a response for the repayment date selected would only ensure that it’s repaid in a timely manner."
cory,Money lion has helped me countless times in time of need when my bank account goes negative or when I needed a little extra to get mine by before my next paycheck money lion is a life saver!
julie,great service fast response in a short time
andrea,I had a emergency that I needed money fast and moneylion was there to give me the money I needed!! It was fast and easy and I have had them for a few months now and never any issues!!

Sara Webb,Thanks for being there when my family 👪 and I  needed
brandy,"I was having trouble verifying my address for instacash so I called customer service. The first attempt was unsuccessful even though I had fixed the address on my debit card. So I called back again and after just a short while, my representative fixed the issue manually and I had cash in hand"
jesse,Nothing bad to say about MoneyLion; they were there to help me when I needed it!
Don Mores,Okay so I do like the many options this mobile banking app offers like credit builder and instant cash advances.. on the other hand though I have run into a few issues with my moneylion account main issue so far was that I tried to pull my last $60 out of an allpoint ATM which is free and the ATM never Despensed any of the cash when I call the ATM company they told me to call moneylion and gave me a reference number well moneylion tells me that there isnt anything they can do besides me print off a form and fill it out to send in to maybe possibly be able to get the last $60 that I just tried to get from the ATM so low and behold I worked for a few hours to make the $60 and the it was ripped right away from me without reason...
Johnna Grace,It's awesome that you guys help out like I had no money was out of gas the other day and remembered about instacash. Real big help Thank you!
Gordon Brown,Awesome app very helpful and dedicated to its members.
customer,"Everything is great except this is the 2nd time I was supposed to get a $25 booster for paying before the end of the due date and neither time have they actually showed up when I took out another. Other than that, the app has been excellent!"
shamonica castle,I have enjoyed reading all the different offers moneylion has.  It's really been enlightening.
Gette,They come in clutch whenever I need extra cash. I LOVE THEM
Jacquelin,Money Lion has provided me services that I need in between paychecks and in addition I build up my credit score. It’s a win win situation. Thank You. Adriene Jones
stephanie,This was the easiest and most useful app that helped me build my credit quick without any hassle or complicated steps just apply for your credit builder account get approved receive your funds into your bank account so you would actually have money to use for anything needed deposited into your account then just set up payments to pay back Loan while building your credit just like how I did within a few months
qwaniesha,It’s doesn’t allow me to connect with chime account in order to take out a loan

Charlotte Williams,Good account to have especially with the features.
erika,"Inconvenient customer service, closed my acct with no warning bc of “suspicious” activities which were my direct deposit."
BRYAN M.,"I feel that my account is secure with them, while also being easy for me to be able to recover. The operator was nice and got straight the the point in assisting me."
Cesar ,5 stars great service
Shawn Avery,"If i could give moneylion a zero or less, I'd give it a negative 5. There's absolutely no customer service just a call center rep that reads prompts and tey and get a supervisor is another joke all in its own. CB loans are advertised as .05% apr or even 0% but that is a negavtive youre charged more for the loan plus in order to get a loan you only receive 10%of until its paid off then have to wait an additional two weeks to even be released to you, you also have to pay for a 19.99$ membership fee for services you already receive if you set up direct deposit. Oh and dont het me started with their false advertisement of getting paid two days early what a joke. And the instacash you do not geyvup to 250$ just because of direct deposit thats a membership fee as well to get the 250$ although you have your direct deposit set up with them. If you have any irregualr deposits made to your account like a friend transferring you money that will make their incapable and unreliable system lose any type of deposit information its ever received from you and its like basically starting iver to recieve instacash again. Its an elementary bank with no customer service or even an IT department to help correct with the incorrect deposits the system lables them as. Ive had nothing but trouble with this bank and the getting paid two days early was only valid for the first two months i started banking with them ever since i have not gotten paid two days early and its been seven months now. Im now just waiting on my direct deposit transfer back to chime because they actually honor what they advertise. Wish i would've never switched."
tyrone,I had the best customer services representative today with Lian.  Lian stay on the phone and answer all of my questions professionally to make sure I was comfortable to submit my application correctly.  Lian is awesome 👏🏿.  I appreciate her great & professional customer services.
Patrick Poland,This app is great!  Has helped me and my family through some tough times!
gilbert,Best thing I ever did was choose Money lion
tony,"Money Lion has been the absolute BEST thing that has ever happened to me. They have a litany of tools available to manage your finances, and a quick and easy loan process in case you need a little extra funds before payday. I would recommend Money Lion to everyone who has money to manage. From expert to novice Money Lion has got you covered."
lindsey,I love Moneylion  it has saved me so many times when I need extra cash. With three teenagers something is always coming up during paydays.
Matt R.,It's been awesome  Great app money's there when you need it
George Jenner,It is really really good
CO,Very easy to use and cheap compare different many other apps
Mike Haver,Moneylion is a great bank. They have so rewards and cash back. They have instacash that helps between paydays. And loans.  Customer service is always helpful if you ever need them.
philip thomas,Always on time with instacash payments to me when I request it. The app is so easy to navigate through.I would recommend them to anyone needing a financial boost!😉
crystal,"Highly recommend avoiding this business at all cost!They’ve locked me out of my account for days, are allowing charges to go through on a card that is supposed to be frozen and telling me it’s active on their end, and couldn’t give me an answer as to why that is when it shows locked on my end.On another occasion, I spoke with a representative who informed me she was issuing a dispute on unauthorized transactions. I called back a few days later and was told a dispute was never created.I’ve also tried checking into hotels on 2 separate occasions and had my card declined both times because the charge was more than ITV was supposed to be. On both occasions, MoneyLion representatives have told me it was the merchant holding the extra money. Each time the merchant showed me exactly what they were charging, and in one instance they even spoke with the MoneyLion representative themselves and were told the same thing.I finally filled a BBB complaint, and the response given by the business was that they do, in fact, hold an extra 20% on charges like hotels and restaurants. Had I been accurately informed the first time this happened I could have planned for it the second time around.This also happened once in a drivethru when I was paying for food, and I had no idea why it was being declined at the time because there was enough in the account to cover my order, but apparently not their extra 20%."
shannon,Thank you for helping me with my fiance's. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
crystal,Great app to use
DANIEL CAMPBELL,Always there when I need the extra cash !!!
Allen H.,Could be better
lecram66,"I have been able to use MoneyLion  without any issues although, I think they charge too much in fees it has been very helpful. And I will continue to use as long as I need to for the future."
Jaymem,I truly appreciate the instacash benefit. I think the $4.99 fee to have immediate action is too high. But then I guess that’s to be a deterrent to overuse. Also I think it would be more beneficial to customers to be able to withdraw the entire amount for which we are approved instead of $75 at a time resulting in more fees.
Jason Harding,"Everything is wonderful, I have no complaints its helped me and my family tremendously to be here at MONEYLION!"
tamara,Love Money Lion! So many options to help someone out! I love having the option of instacash. My only complaint would be that I wish you could have the option to borrow more than $50 dollars in a request.
freddy,Money fast and easy. No hidden fees or rules just request and get paid
Devante Mc Leod,You keep telling me my bank isn’t connected an when I try an give the info to you to reconnect it you say it’s wrong and I know it’s not
Jiahui wu ,Always there when you need them!

brandye,Great Service this company believes in second            Chances Thanks A lot!!!
ROBERT B GOODSON JR,I don't think you should charge extra each time you I need a advanced loan.. you should have a monthly fee or something.. I have use better app.. but thanks!
Samantha Topolewski,Love it great app for money
william,I have been using Money Lion for around 4 months now and my experience has been beyond rewarding. I started out making a few cash advances from my own paychecks for some tight situations. I decided to look into opening an account with them for banking and that allows me to get my paycheck 2 days early. I have also joined a program called credit builder plus. I was given a account with $1000 in it and was allowed to use $125 of it. I get the rest when i have paid the full loan. The time from payment 1 to the end its reported on my credit as making on time payments and that is what i need the most help with.. They also offer investment options. Im in that as well and can't wait to see how well i do. There is many other opportunities they offer and if anyone is interested look them up and see what they offer. Im happy and proud that i did.
Dan,Just when I need money. Money Lion comes to save the day.
Naaaaa gghhhhj,Best app I’ve used! Couldn’t be happier
MASTER KEY,This is a life saver you will need to pay the next payday but it will save you a lot of stress. We all know how stressful it is when you are tight on money. 0% interest? Totally worth it. Thank you!

monica,Very fast and easy way to get money and pay it back without high interest
Mike Wassil,"Been using MoneyLion for several months now, and it's perfect for me. It helps me bridge the gaps between paychecks so I don't miss due dates on bills and incur late fees - that more than makes up for the account fees and tips!"

Carlyle Mitchell,Excellent application love it
ringo Gamez,The best of all time
Coll Daniel,You guys are LITTERALLY the best and always help out just when needed. Just wish I was able to take out more!
Jessica Clark,Amazing site even though took me a long time to pay them back they still give me the opportunity to get a new advance out
Cheyenne B,Fast & easy. I wish I could get more & I wish it was up to $100 at a time instead of $50. Too many fees with the most being $50 @ a time. Other than that I'd give 5 stars.

latasha,Awesome app; totally worth it and strongly recommend it
Tamika Leach,This is an amazing resource. This site has proven to be very beneficial. I hope to be able to grow with this company. I see this company  help me build my credit  And to guide me on a straight path to gain A sound and secure financial  stabilization. Thank you MoneyLion❤️
stacey,Through Money Lion where there's a will there's a way! Although I was unable to link my bank thru plaid I still was given a chance to borrow money while building up my credit with instacash!! Super excited thanks Money Lion!
mason k McGill ,Money Lion helped me when I wasn’t sure what I was going to do for extra cash til payday. I also enjoy the rewards and other services they provide.
Timothy Glenn,"So far I have for the most part enjoyed my experience with MoneyLion, the only problems I've had so far is twice I was ""locked out"" of my account for ""suspicious activity""  -- which I like the fact that they are monitoring for fraudulent transactions and whatnot, but I've been too easily locked out twice now with no explanation as to why or how I can avoid this problem in the future. I've emailed them to see if they can give me a solution.  It's pretty easy to unlock, just have to email them some documents proving its my account. Other than that, it's been pretty great! I love the auto investing and the options for investing, the new round ups and double round ups investment feature, and I'm super excited they have a crypto feature coming as well!"
Melissa Kay,No issues with MoneyLion. Always seem to be very helpful!
Chavonn Brown,Great app and very helpful
olivia,"Excellent service, this app has gotten me through some tough times. I highly recommend it!"
D M,Love money lion..sucessful at every instacash!!
james,I absolutely love MoneyLion. The payments are low and instacash is a blessing for those that need to borrow money in between paydays.
anthony,Very helpful when you need extra cash. Only bad thing you can only take 50.00 at a time so makes the payback a little more then others. But it a great app and you can always up your boost by paying on time and recommend it to others. App easy to use.
Her,"Hello, there! I strongly recommend this app for everyone to use because it gives you great access to your information, great service benefits!"
derek Smith,It is great way cheaper than a payday loan.
Kenny Moore,This is legit
Amanda Blevins,One of the best! They are so much more than a bank! They offer financial stability
sharon,"Everything that I have experienced in the years that I’ve been using MoneyLion thus far is that everything is very WYSIWYG– in the best way. Even amongst some of my favorite banks and credit unions, not everything is as clear and concise as MoneyLion has been able to manage. On top of that, their Instacash has gotten me over no less than a few financial humps. I’ve even felt comfortable enough to tip them when using instacash after time had proven that the app and services are legit and straightforward. I recommend looking into it at the absolute least!"
Red ,MoneyLion is great they are excellent with the perks & service
Omar Hernandez,I love money lion. They come through when im at my worst financially. Having to ask someone for money can be difficult but with money lion they understand and are there for you when needed.Thank you so much for your help.

Tamara Saxton,Was an easy and fast way to get a little money I needed to help me out. Five stars !
jennifer,Great service great app love it other than that incremental $50 loan plus payback fee for each one . That’s extremely highWhy can’t we borrow as much as we need not offered ? Sometimes I may not need the whole $50 at that time ? Why can’t I just borrow 1 solid $100 if I need ? App supposed to help you not take from you
Lacey Davenport,Great app help in my most need and easy payments to apply
Crystal Bryant,I’m so glad and greatful to have found this app!!! I hope it’s everything it’s supposed to be with fixing up my credit because I’m loving this new get out of debt now app!!!!

kam,"Great service always get the money I need and, the only thing that is repayed always is what I agree to. Nothing more"
William Phinney,"I don’t even know what to say, other then Thank you you turned a very scattered, Emotional week into one I will literally never forget 💜I downloaded money lion about a year ago but at the time unfortunately my bank was not a supported bank with them(Chime) Well that other day I was really down and out while looking on Google Chime support of banks for a payday loan and I noticed that come up again and clicked because I remember that time I was at an option for this app but for some reason I clicked it and let me tell you I am so grateful so beyond happy that I did because he definitely added so many different banks that are not eligible as well as mine chime. I want to say it took me a total of 10 minutes, between re-downloading the app, filling out all the necessary information Name, DOB, address, email, you know all that lovely stuff every other site has to ask lol. You have to link a ACTIVE debt card along with the cards account to prove you have a regular income source coming in.Yes, Michigan Unemployment is totally acceptable:) I want to say it took 30 seconds to verify my bank account, Make sure my income is Consistent. Once it said I was approved I noticed I had a $50 dollar Instacash waiting for me whenever I needed it, The best part is once I asked for it it was in my linked bank account in less than a minute. Look I pretty much probably no it’s not bragging about the bank in this review on writing is probably just going to continue to grow because the cash advances not even close of the most amazing stuff that they have that they offer two of us. All I Gotta say is download the app sign up check it out yourself, and enjoy a new bank that makes you just want to Brag because they are amazing 😂😂💜💜Love;DWilson 🤓🤓💜"
chiquita,Love money lion great app it helps a lot of ways.
Lamarcus Stewart,"Always there to spot me an extra $50, at no APR, when I need it"
jaritza,no way to contact customer service directly. the live chat bot is horrible. the phone number it gives you is horrible and takes you way to long to get in contact with an actual person
Nicole Brown,Best app ever
kendra,Great way to get out of a jam. Been using them for roughly over 2 years. Always helpful when fast Deposit is needed
john,Very well accurate. I will recommend anyone to try this app!
JustMe,It has saved me sooooo many times. I live it.
derek,Highly recommended.  Fees are reasonable.
clarence,Awesome way to get some quick cash until next pay day.
joseph casaretto,"MoneyLion was unbelievably easy and super fast...I saw the app and thought it couldn't be as easy as it says, so I downloaded it just to try it out and sure enough, it was. All I had to do was answer a couple of questions and input my info, and within seconds my small money loan was in my bank account. I highly recommend this app."
Lamont El gran,"I've had a MoneyLion account for 2-3 years now and I have zero complaints. Its everything you want/need in an online bank account. The only drawbacks are due to the fact that it is online only - no physical bank to go to, no checks etc. I get my paycheck direct deposited and have used the InstaCash feature for a $50 advance on my next paycheck without issue."
Jaye Bird,Very handy & great to use
Jennifer Santilli,This is an easy to use service to access supplemental cash for emergency expenses.
Joshua,I like it so far. Wish I could get the bonus features for the direct deposit. I can't because my finacial institution isn't listed on the automated system. I did a manual change and so now I have to wait for the first deposit. Also I wish it would state my credit score as well as allow me to send money same day to my friends or family. I also wish it was Visa and not Mastercard. I wish it would also allow me cashback on purchases.
Mark Peters,Saved me in more ways then one!! Thank you 😊
stefanie,I got help with a loan an then more with out even asking this is a great app to have I ask everyone try it
david,Absolutely love that I can use instacash.
joe hermida,It's been a tough year so honestly having this lifeline has been helpful. I'd rather this then $100's in overdraft fees.
ashleigh,I highly recommend MoneyLion for your short term loan needs.  They’re great and deposit funds right away into your account.
trenee,Great app for small advances on pay check if needed. I use it often also great investing too. Do need to fix the relink bank account though
Samantha,The app is great but to get your money asap you have to pay $4.99 for every $50.  They should do it at $100 for $4.99
Susan,"Moneylion is great,  quick, convenient and easy. Thank you moneylion!"
Rebecca Bridges,"thank you, life saver"
Emily Travaille,i wish there was a more clear method to understanding the instant cash loan amounts mine only will do 25 for me otherwise so far so good in all other areas
LC,I don’t understand why sometime I get a higher amount to borrow and then I pay back on time and then it is lowered?
Lane,"100%, real cash advances. Great company!"
Faith David,Always there when I need a lil extra cash.
Kari McCandlish,Great app but fees are to high for each transaction!!

Kristy Keysaw,Always there when I need it and helps me organize my monthly bills
"Kimberly-Deltona,FL",I love Money Lion!  I have used it sveral times and I have never had trouble borrowing and it is available as soon as I pay it.
Jason Lovelace,"I am so glad I found Money Lion. If I need a few bucks ahead of time before getting my monthly check from the VA, and they see proof that I receive monthly deposits, then Boom! It's all good, and they will send it right to my account. They give you a decent amount to work with as well. Not just a measly $20 like a Float Me. It is your choice to pay a fee to get it instantly or wait a few days to avoid the fee. Once you build trust with them by borrowing some cash and paying back what you borrowed, when you said you would on payday, then all kinds of other benefits start to open up. This includes the ability to borrow a larger sum of money than what was previously fronted to you, as well as some other lending and banking features. The only thing i would say I wish was different, would be to increase the available amount to request each time. Especially if you are trying to get more than just $50. Each time if you want it instantly (lets face it, most people either do want it fast or they really do need it fast) there is a fee to instantly receive your cash in basically minutes (for some it could possibly take a few hours). I think a good system would be, if you leave a tip of a certain amount, then the fee gets waived. It's a business and totally understandable that these people need and want to make their money, so I definitely get it. Like maybe a fee for every $100 would be a bit more reasonable. Regardless of that, I still give Money Lion 5 stars. Thanks guys."
luis,Great tool to invest money and get short term loans.
Jimmy Sweat Jr.,"Have Been using their website for a year and a half and it did help me improve credit by 40 points  but mostly im using for Instacash , Helped me a lot in situations we i had no money at all , I Recommend them and give it a try , i will keep using their service"

STEPHEN BOWLES,"Extremely helpful when I need it, love it! I would highly recommend this to anyone"
Jerry Bradford,Great app and money comes quick into account
Kay Ayala,The only issue I have is the limitation of requesting $50.00 max at a time. That process seems to cost the user more in “tips” if more than $50.00 is needed.
victor,Its a very good app for getting instant money for small amounts without waiting to ask someone. Thanks a lot for helping instantly.
danyele,Very dependable
susan,Awesome!!!!!!!
melissa,You guys are definitely a life saver!💯🙏
lydia,Amazing!! Are life savers
Curtis Milton,20 bucks a month offers insta cash ($100) to start and 500 dollar loans. No credit check. The loan does take some time to pay off unless you use the service temporarily and pay it off quickly. Low interest rates.
Andrea & JR Rolax,Love them!! Great system!!!
raymond,Money lion has helped me make it check to check and has graciously not charged me late fees when I’ve been struggling the rewards are awesome for just using your money lion debit card you get cash back with the shake and bank rewards

So hook yourself up into a big daddy of cash I know I kinda sound like a commerical but I'm not y'all have a good one I am money lion helped me buy a house by all those programs they have no lie"

kimberly,MoneyLion has been good. It allows me to borrow money. I receive it the same day. It gets paid back. Never had a problem. It really is a stress free way to borrow money and pay it back. It is something I would recommend.
Debra,"Always Reliable. Helpful advances, easy going customer service. One of the best apps to have. Especially for credit building."
amanda,Perfect extra cash app
vandashell,Ive never found anything like this. This has helped me a lot since i started.
joaquin alva,"user friendly app, help when you have an emergency bill and great credit building help with a loan ive never had the opportunity to take advantage of before. only people who may not get anything by joining is if you have a 800 credit score and no income that is received by direct deposit."
Megan,I have been using moneylion for a couple of months now. When a friend referred me I was unsure at first about the company but I am please to say I have no regrets. If I am short on cash before my payday or a unexpected event occurs I can instantly get cash without paying interest. I just simply pay them back on my next payday. Thanks moneylion!!!

Alejandro Cortes,The best of them all
jennifer,the guy told me to unlink my account so that I can relink. now I can't relink my account.  I have tried too many times. my account was fine until he tried to help me. and still no one has even tried to help me properly.
cory,Didn't receive my payment 2 days ahead of time and have been nothing but a hassle to find out why or where it is. Highly disappointed in this bank.
Natty,Money lion is the way to go ...I was looking for a fast loan quick and in minutes I got it and they got a ton of my features to use ..
Tim,"I like money lion so far but there is one issue I'm having, not a big deal but frustrating. I set up direct deposit and have received 2 paychecks through the direct deposit, but for some reason the app keeps asking me to finalize my account by setting up direct deposit."
amanda mcmillian,Its great and i never been happier
denna,Amazing app! Highly recommend!!!
Jesse,One of the best apps for loans!! And it even accepts my small town bank. :)
Shane Taylor,"I’m less than 3 months in to my second loan, on autopay, and current.  I was notified by multiple sources this weekend that I was reported 30 days late by MoneyLion even though I’m current and this current status also reflects current/never late on their app.   I had immediately disputed the error with Transunion then reached out to MoneyLion ‘support’ where I have lost all hope.  They won’t confirm my current status, acknowledge an error,  or even offer to look into it, they only send a link to dispute with Transunion and say they need 30 days.  They only respond with templates, and since I’ve asked to be escalated to a manager, my complaint has been ignored since.  I don’t usually write reviews like this, but this kind of credit reporting error is very harmful and in my case, totally random and false.  Plus, they know I’m current. Obviously, if a customer is stating something is wrong when they’re in good standing, they should do the right thing and assure me that they are working to fix this. Instead, I’m left to agonize. The ‘Credit Builder Loan’ has become a credit destroyer.  Please beware."
lisa,"Building my credit, never knew it could be this easy , I appreciate the cash advances."
rodney,"Nice and easy application,  really good"
Stephanie Davis,Hoot of a job love this app
customer,I love it and they got good customer service. Quick
kendrick Dixon,Woot woolly love it constantly yep yep yep

Samantha Joyce Cratty,I really like this app. I found a lot of helpful tools. Learning about investing and loana
Dawn Cuomo,Excellent service and when you need that quick emergency money they are there foryou

Cassandra Lujan,Good financial service.
Clay S,"Easy to qualify for cash advance,still feeling it out so far its been good."
jessette mcintyre,Awesome Very awesome serviceEasy to use
Isaiah Mackey,It's cool but should let you take it all out at 1 time instead of multiple tips and multiples of 4.99 for each transaction.other than that though it's very helpful.
True review,Reliable & dependable
Dustin,It's great I love how fast it was.  Awesome quick easy
Nick Burden,Hands down the best cash advance app there is. Especially people with bad or no. credit
Maria Ochoa,..........................
Ashandia Blount,Its downright amazing. So helpful in such expensive times.
Jenny,I just don't  like that they charge the money fast in aweek you don't really have time to use it cause by the time they put it in you have to repay it back
Haji Iyne Kan,So far instacash it's been very helpful. Too early to see my credit go up yet....waiting!!!!!
Uriah Wesson,I get ripped off by you guys I think MoneyLion is reading 60s timeline cause they you do business is taking the freedom out that’s not the way to do business giving little and charging money then they took
customer,Love this app!!! Great for when you need a quick help out & awesome ways to help build your credit !!
chantelle,Best loan app ever and so easy to use I have worked myself up to 75$ so quickly ! Thanks. !
Antwine Applon Jr,No complaints
Pk,I love this place! Very quick & amazing.
drew,I love MoneyLion it's a great app for people that need Instacash and a way to build credit through the credit builder account. In addition to that they give you tons of money saving tips.I'm glad that I got introduced to this app and now I get to tell all my family and friends about it.THANKS MONEYLION
Shanny Lu Who,Money lion had my back in my most desperate situation!  Instant ..quick service .. even w my acct negative. They gave me a loan to hold me over ! Ty money lion!!
Justin Ussing,Ot was real easy to use

Eric Iglesias,The best company I ever had they help me out so much they have so many tools to improve you financially and to build your credit you will not find this type of service anywhere I promise thank money lion your the best.....
DONTA CANDLER,I love the Instacash options! Great company who rewards you for doing the right things?
nikole williams,It was easy to sign up and get instant cash. It said I could get $250 but ended up getting $25 to start. I didn’t like that I was charged $4.99 to receive it instantly because it said I could do that anyways when I signed up. But hey it was ok. I did get it in seconds
Susan Medina,Late payment charges and interest was high am glad i found nowcoin.io investment platform that helps me grow my money without the need of a loan and most importantly they send daily interest to my personal wallet. I hope everyone would try this and echo my view as well.
rose,I hear it’s good for those going through hard times & aren’t financially stable.
lesley,Very efficient and helpful app! I love it
david,"Was able to get $25.00 easily by linking my debit card and I paid 4.99 for express funding so it would go to my account without having to wait. The $4.99 isn’t due until you pay back the $25. If you need more than a few dollars to hold you over until pay day I’m not quite sure if this is the best option, but for a few extra bucks and no crazy fees it met my needs."
mark,Great app. No outrageous fees and always there when I need a couple extra bucks. Recommend this app to anyone
richard,Awesome I love this app
Lucas,Get thing love it
leslie king,very helpful and understanding. Gives you money to your account instantly. I love you guys

julio,"When I opened my Money Lion account(s) I paid the $19.99 monthly fee so that I would have access to the credit builder plus loan, should the need arise. I have a checking account as well as an investment account. When I attempted to access the credit builder plus loan, I was told Money Lion cannot verify my Money Lion checking account! Disappointed to say the least. I need to have an external bank account. Makes no sense to me!!!!!"

Samantha Smyth,Always there when you need them friendly professional very helpful
Manuel L.,"I definitely love money lion, it definitely helps when I have a need a quick loan when my paycheck runs out or is running low and all I have to do is pay back the next time I get paid... If I have any advice I would choose money lie on until everyone about it because it definitely is a place to keep your money safe"
Chad Flannery,"They are awesome, by far the best and most comprehensive financial app I’ve ever used. I don’t know of any other credit builder loan that gives you a portion of the loan amount up front and it was immediately available in my account after signing the loan documents. The instacash advance amounts and boosts offered are really generous as well. If I could give them 6 starts out of 5 I would."
ellen,This platform has allowed me to feel comfortable that I'm on the right track financially. More than just a bank. I feel absolutely sure that this is the best move I've made moneywise.

courtney,"Pleasantly surprised, I did not expect to get the help I needed so quickly and so painlessly!!! I will definitely be referring everyone I know 🙂"
jeremy,I don't like the limited option to only withdraw 50 dollars from insta cash. It limits you that way you have to keep acquiring fees to use it and then ask for a tip. It should at least give you the option to withdraw 100 or more.
Anthony Fubared,MoneyLion has the best customer service ever.
darelle,I love how money lion helps me with everything

nokomis,You guys are helping me build my credit which will open a lot of door for me
Kris,Love money lion
henry,MoneyLion is like my knight in shining armor. Thet rescued a damsel in distress. Thanks MoneyLion.
Joaniel Fairley,"MoneyLion has saved my bacon a few times. I use the instacash option quite frequently. They let me take $350/pay period. They also have an option to take out a loan through them. I got approved for $500. The downfall is that they only gave me $100 upfront and will give me the other $400 after I pay it off. Also, you can only take out $50 at a time through instacash and you ""should"" pay a tip on every single one of those transactions. It can add up quickly. Of course you do not have to ""tip"" on those, but that is how MoneyLion helps people out. My advice tho: do not rely on this service. It can catch you in a debt cycle with them."
Nicole ,Awesome! So easy and stress free. Thank you MoneyLion!
dana,worked very hard to rectify this situation but it has yet to be resolved hopefully I can have my money someday if the computers let them. Give it to me
eugene,"MoneyLion money site had given me far more than any other that U have experienced. IT has not been over pushy, helped with the things I was seeking help with and gone above and beyond what I expected. This is a company which I am happy to give my confidence."

john,These companies don't believe in people getting paid cash although there are regular cash deposits from my employment you claim there is no employment detected. Its sad people like myself can't get help simply because I get paid cash
Debra Lanier,"They advertise what was possible and have upheld their end. Words are volume. Money Lion roars very, very loudly. I'm not a fan of taking out small loan amounts because you still have to pay back but good to know the opportunity is there when ready unlike traditional banks that don't care and see you as a number. Roar lion roar."
NathanK,Dependable as long as you are. One of the better apps for money matters that I have found.
dylan,"MoneyLion has helped me time and time again, definitely recommend this app!"
Customer Marie,Great to use when you have no cash

Pamela Waters,"They have motivated me to actually put forth the effort to fix my credit, save, watch my spending and invest."
TK,"I waited almost a year for my PUA to go through, when I finally got a notification saying I got my deposit. I called my landlord and some other people I owe and when I tried to pay them it wouldn't let me access my funds. They asked me to send them documentation verifying my identity.....documentation I already sent them to open the account in the 1st place. Anyways, i did as they asked,  and now I have to wait 3 to 5 days, and look like a liar to everybody I called and told I would pay. There customer service is mediocre at best. They gave my cop out catch 22 answers to everything.2days later and no progress has been made, I  fact i received another pua payment, and they sent it back. Like double you tea eff. Are you kidding me?"
Kim,They have been a great payday loan company lto work with. And the money gets deposited quickly no matter what option you pick.
herc40,Today I spoke with a very kind gentleman by the name of Raymond who had contacted me by returning my call For which I discussed the issue I was having.

Vernon “V. FraSe” Frazier,Money Lion was very easy to use.Meet their simple requirements & they will help you today!
Lesley Hunt Etheridge,I like the amount of money they let you borrow BUT they keep getting the repayment dates wrong for me. I get paid every 2 weeks but they always set the repayment date for less time than that.
Charlee Smith,"Was very impressed with this application. But I asked for 250$ and they sent 25.00.What type of bank account shouldn't matter.I have two direct deposit accounts and yall don't take prepaid bank accounts for deposit.

alexa,I am going back to my old bank not only have I not gotten my debit card that was supposedly sent out 2 months ago my direct deposit wait times are ridiculous.
 Veronica ,"I've been a Money Lion member for a few years. Since the time they used to give you back money from your membership payments. I've had my ups and downs with some of their staff, not everyone is perfect; but I can definitely say that at the end of the day my issue has been resolved. My only negative at this point is their direct deposit algorithm; it can predict the wrong payment day for a loan and you're forced to call ahead to try and fix it. Personally, it's very inconvenient.  I was hoping for a fixed payment date that is flexible should any issue arise. All in all, I recommend money lion for sure. They definitely have made my financial situation easier on many an occasion."
Victoria,This is quick and easy to get money and it is hassle free. Got to Love it🤑😘
delores,No complaints great banking and investing app
Clarke Kent,"This app has helped me a great deal with needing a quick short term loan just to get me to payday if needed.  I recommend this app, absolutely!"
fausto,"The fees are high, and they keep the same amount even after repeated on time and early payments. I prefer my time account because they don't charge me for borrowing or overdraft protection"
candice,"The money is sent to you within minutes, if not seconds! I love having money lion!"
Nick,MoneyLion is great with helping you keep track of and also save your money! I recommend this app to everyone!
Nal Bae,I believe that they MoneyLion is the absolute best I am so grateful for the times I needed some fast cash and they granted me the small loan I get denied at any other place and was given the opportunity just by linking my bank account info and immediately received the funds! Definitely am giving them 5 stars and most indefinitely referring to my friends and family!
rebecca,At first I was kind of impressed but then I invited one friend got the bonus I was supposed to get then I invited two friends and I ain't seen nothing yet and my name didn't even come up on their stuff after they downloaded it and did their stuff that they were supposed to do for me to get my reward shaking my head
Rodney Briones,My card was locked for no reason and now I can’t access my money for 5 business days
Alex Nigro,i am so glad that you offer a  a way of getting extra money to help pay bills. thanks

Aaryn Santora,Awesome service!!! Fast reliable a must have for people on a budget and building credit
corihubert,"I love this app, it has helped me out a lot when I’ve been in a pinch!!  Thank you so much!!"
nickii s,I tried to withdraw money to my checking account but instead to send the $25 to the roar money account when I don't even have a reward debit card yet it was that decision the first time I use insta cash the second time I use instacash went to the roar account which is b******* because I paid an extra $5 for it to be sent in advance and it didn't get sent to my debit card bank account I think I should not have been charged a $5 fee for sending money to the same application I requested it from and then I have to wait two days for it to process just because it processed to the wrong account please fix this issue or else I won't use your service anymore
cathy,Great way for some quick cashVery easy and the fees are minimal

Deana,A very fair company with one-time education and tools. Just a little slow with loan payoff posting or would be 5 stars.
corey,Thank you so much for the instacash it comes in very handy.
christopher,"I paid off my loan with my debit card so that i could receive money from creditbuilder in the time stated 2-4 days. Now i'm being told that it could possibly be. 2weeks. Customer service sucks because they make up excuses and won't honor the loan contract agreement. That is why I'm leaving this review. I explained i paid off lpan early, because i needed my money and they assured me i would get it promptly, but now that has changed"
gabrielle,"I will be posting reviews on every possible site letting people know that your company happily steals money from its clients. Its absolutely ridiculous that not once, but twice charges from non existent websites have been validated, that your company happily took back 600 in instacash but because paydates change, won't let us make a loan payment(your CSR is on recording refusing to make the payment) and make us wait wait 3 to 5 business days while you validate the pay date changes, meanwhile in those days fraudulent charges hit the account and now we can't even make the loan payment because we have to wait 10 days for your company to review the dispute,  which your company will most likely validate for a second time, despite the charges being made to non existent websites."
Tony Kittle,They fixed my issue another way that was satisfying.
erik,The app is great
Unknown,Love it been using for years they always been there to help me out
alberto,Very quick and convenient service that will hold you over until payday.

leah,Very good very easy very helpful
Kimberly Davis,"Upfront fees no hidden fees cash in an instant, you can pay it back before or on payday the more on time payments you make your advance amount increases plus it helps build your credit"
Kentrelle Charles,Helped with me getting food and gas
christi,Awesome 😎 thank u
dannieL,Overall this is a great way to become more finally literate and to explore many options. The credit builder account is a great option to build positive payment history and a savings account simultaneously. The only downside is that there is a $9.99 or $19.99 biweekly payment that comes along with the credit building account. I find that outrageous and a way to capitalize. Overall this account is helping to build positive credit history so that in the future these types of accounts with excess fees will not have to be an option due to being able to obtain better rates and options for credit accounts.
customer,Wish I could get more on my advance but so far overall I like the app
J Villan ,Good app and everyone should have it
tracey,MoneyLion has always been there for me when no one else was diff best app yet... Just wish I could get the chance to upgrade to more money
paula,The very best in credit building and putting money in your pocket financial institution on the market!
itsyazzybabi,"MoneyLion might seem like a lot of other services out there, but it really is so much more and superior.  You can still get a lot of services like a debit card which pays you early, and investment services, but their cash services are better than any other service I've seen.  Up to $200 cash advances and $1000 low interest loans are quick and easy.  This company is a gold stadard."

tanisha and terrrance,Roar money  powerful contribution when it counted
lance,Well this app offers everything that a person who needs financial services could ever want. It lacks sophistication in its technology is very hard to connect on accounts to this money line mobile app account it doesn’t except a lot of other apps don’t except your routing and banking number in their automatic upload where they have your company New York State has been under maintenance since I downloaded this app so the app is good could be great if they just do some minor bug face fixes
Savanna Swink,One of the best advance apps I have been exposed to. Very easy to use and super helpful in times of need!
sonny,You guys are life saver the insta cash is great would give 5 stars if we're able to use my direct deposit to.your bank instead of having to use a 3rd party bank to get the credit builder loan.

Jack,They are AWESOME! Made it easy to get an advance and pay it back...I love MONEYLION! THANK YOU!
Michelle Alvarez,"I just opened this account and made a transfer from my primary account to my Money Lion account and then from my Money Lion account to my Cashapp account and then Money Lion locked my account and card so I haven't been able to use my card for a month now and I've sent in the necessary documents and it's been over two weeks and my account is still frozen and I've not received an email from you with an update. I've had to call to get an update and that shows the lack of professionalism this company has. I'm tired of not being able to use this account and just for my inconvenience, I should be awarded a reward of $150 inconvenience fee for all the drama that I've been put through."
jonathan,The app is wonderful! Easy to use and very convenient when you need money fast.
Candice Frazier,I LOVE THIS!!! Its helped me out tremendously.. as soon as you pay it back you can reborrow if necessary.. HIGHLY recommend MoneyLion
Jess,"I was in need of funds and came across MoneyLion App and I’m very thankful I did! They loaned me the money I needed quickly and conveniently! They have been lifesavers for me since I was laid off due to the financial impact of COVID-19 on my place of employment. Any questions or concerns I’ve had, they instantly provide the answers or suggestions. They make the loan process pain free and work with you on payments if necessary through out your time with them. Thanks MoneyLion for great service!"
rosanne,"I give MoneyLion 4 Stars because it has helped me get the cash I needed in desperate times when I had no other options. The only thing that I wish was different is the amount you can borrow at a time. I had $160 available that I could borrow but the max amount you can choose at a time is $50. If I needed to I could immediately choose to get another $50 out, and so on until the $160 available was reached. Only negative aspect is the $4.99 it charges you each time you choose to borrow money. When I borrowed $160 I ended up paying back over $179. Despite the money they tax you to borrow money its still a very useful and helpful app especially when you absolutely need money now."
Manny Gonzales,Think you guys are great helped me when nobody else would would of been sleeping on the streets if it wasent for yiu thanks
Naidean Jones,GreatI like moneylion
rachael,"If you're learning about how to invest and improve your money management, then I'll suggest Money Lion.."

E M M,They helped me in a time of need and it was fast and efficient
TROY SROCKTON,"I was in need of some money quick and my son said he used moneylion and was very please with them so I thought I would give them a try. I got approved and sent me the money I needed , HASSLE free it was awesome feeling to receive money real quick. Donna"
Mark Woods,I have not been a MoneyLion customer for very long but I am completely satisfied with the service. The instacash comes in handy when you’re in a bind. The only thing I have to say that is negative is I think it takes way too long for payments to post for the credit builder loans and membership payments. Other than that I think MoneyLion is wonderful.
Ashley Hawkins,"Instant Cash, really fast & super convenient"
Melissa S,Great app for help with finances!
Dominic Spano,This a great app. They help build credit. Give u tips every day on what u can work on. They offer cashback investments and advances to help.you out if your short before a paycheck. Customer service is always so quick too and helpful. I highly recommend  them

abhilash,Awesome  Best this
Ac Moore,Money Lion is the absolute BEST APP out there for needing a temporary financial uplift to gst ya through! When you find yourself needing aome cash they are very helpful with that! It isnt like those other BOGUS APPS where they wanna give ya 10 bux after you went througha bunch of BS to get linked! Here its SUPER EASY to link up and they are generous with funds as long as ya pay them back!!! I am a HUGE FAN!!! ( this isnt no paid for review either!!) Just sayin!!!!!!
Michal Thompson,Great site just dont like that they only do 50 increments
Reina T,Money Lion is something to have at all times .

frances,Pat was excellent. ! Thanks for fixing my issue easily when on one else could!
Nisha,My ex stole all my money not once but twice and she ruined my life it has been aweful she is in county jail on theft and identity theft charges and pleaded guilty and all that was left was money lion to give me my money back so far they have I'm still waiting for one more dispute to be resolved and I'm praying they give me my the rest of my money back that was stolen but so far they have and that is amazing they are a good bank and they take care of there customers in very happy so far how I just hope this last dispute is resolved and then I can go on with my life.
jessica,Came through when I needed them the most.
maxwell,Great app! I love that it invests money for me!
kenneth,I think its ridiculous how your interest on loans went up. I hate that its not an actual bank I can use on platforms like robin hood. I don't have access to easily pull or put money on my card. Instacash always asks for a tip when you already make $3.99. The features compared to when you started are wack. You used to let me use credit monitor without having to pay some crazy extra fee. I used to really like you. I just use this company for the free instacash. Use and abuse it until they take it away or make it mandatory to tip. This app used to be able to be designed to help you take control of your financial well being. Now. Now its just an app to keep you down financially and stuck with then or owing credit to them. Use credit Karma!
michael,I love this app
Randinio Tabafunda,I think the app is great and the insta-cash option is really helpful and amazing and the fact that there is allot of tools being offered to help build your credit and fix your credit is awesome but what made me give 3 stars is that all those extra credit things I have tried using dose not help at all for person like me that has bad credit.. the insta-cash works great but the credit stuff dose not
shamim nabukenya,"I like Moneylion overall. But have had a technical issue with the ""Credit"" section not properly updating that I have been unable to get rectified for over a year. My ""credit score"" updates monthly as it is supposed to. However, most other sections of the ""Credit"" section (""Payment History, Credit Utilization, Credit Inquiries, Revolving Accounts, Collections,"" etc.) have not been updated in more than a year and are very incorrect.I have called in and chatted with technical support on more than a half dozen occasions and cannot seem to get the issue resolved which is frustrating."
Dee,"Moneylion offers advances, loans, information on finances, investment but their discrepancies outweigh the offerings. Believe me beware of their services. My account was unexpected closed for unusual activity from a ach deposit that I was expecting. I received direct deposit in this account every two weeks. They do this alot as I have talked to another I know that had an account and if you go to other reviews this is a common practice. I have had problems using my atm card. This situation has put me in a terrible bind and now my funds are in limbo. I am angry and mad!"

Franklin velasquez,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 5 STARS!!!!!!!

UB Kraken,Great and honest service. Highly recommend
Carlos Negron,The quality of this bank since it has become roar money has been awful.i have had my account hacked and had to wait 3 weeks to get my funds back then a week later made a cash deposit and then a purchase with those funds the same day and they placed a hold on account asking for an explanation of the immediate purchase and it will now take 3 to 14 days to resolve.i will be switching all my direct deposits from this bank as I no longer feel comfortable trusting them with my money

catherine,"Do not go to an allpoint ATM and try to take out money in 2 seperate transactions. They will suspend your account and ask for driver's license, proof of residency and 3-5 days to fix. Do not make the same mistake I did. Avoid this account all together.Update:  they say it now will take 7 business days to release my account even though they have received my information. I am done with this shady ass company. Go to chime. They won't rip you off like this.Another update:  moneylion responds even though they can't do anything quicker than 7 business days. Avoid moneylion like the plagueYou all are scamming people doing this. You should be looked into by the state of New york"

william,I think moneylion is great i love using moneylion
Jerry Brooks,Money lion is not bad.  I love the love they show with instacash compared to the other offerings.
Lin Lawhon Carl,"Whatever you do don't fall behind on Instacash because Moneylion will raid every account they have access to it doesn't matter if you let them know or not. Also have my second loan with them after completing the first but twice I have moved money in and immediately scheduled the loan payment and twice they took it within hours for instacash even with the loan payment scheduled so I'm defaulting on a 300$ instacash payment and a $1000+ loan and I don't even feel bad about it because of their practices. If you fall behind, watch out."

Steven Hyuga,Moneylion really does come through when you need extra funds and when you are looking to invest and save.
Jenna Proctor,Instacash was fast! Hope it will increase though as time passes. Still checking this as I’m very New to Moneylion.
Catherine Salaam,It's a shame the app bags over and over again for a tip and then charges a fee in order to get the disbursement immediately it is conceivable that a person who is asking for an advance needs the money now all of it and the bereavement if you do not give a tip and then pay the $4 fee to receive your money is deplorable and a practice you should not engage in any further it's distasteful.You don't have to pay back the fees on the total amount the consumer does so if you want $10 or more then you should reduce the amount borrowed to whatever it is after you're begging for tips and fee has been taken from the money the person who needs it at that moment will repay.
Steven Sims,Seems great....haven’t paid my fee yet....to be continued... Hopefully this is decent.Usually this is a bad idea to borrowUpdate: Still amazing but gives me extra cash but not available. lol. Great other than that

Edgar Brummett ,I'm disappointed that u say I have boosts but when I go to my account nothing there
tyrone,Great help for when I’m stuck at work without transportation
Gia Sava,"My Roar money account was closed and support is almost non existent. There was mention of suspicious activity and now they are stating that I violated my deposit agreement. They returned an electronic transfer from a Hardship withdrawal from my companies retirement plan. The Deposit agreement states that there is no limits on deposits from a 3rd party. Even if there was it was only $7400 to help pay medical bills and a few other bills that I have accrued during the pandemic(my wife is deaf and recently had surgery as well as being unable to work because she relies on reading lips mostly). Customer service was atrocious, uncaring, and vague. I have been a customer for several years and bought in to their features such as shaking your phone for cash back rewards(.05 cents for $800) or the free cash advance that they will only let you take in $50 increments and charge $3.99 if you want the ""instacash"" instant then they repeatedly ask for tips and show you pictures of people pouting. Let's do the bath $3.99 plus $2-5 tip on 50 bucks=$5.99 to 8.99. I was also told that I would not be refunded any of my money that is currently in my account which thankfully is only $8.40 but honestly it would be nice to eat this weekend even if it's Ramen noodles. I have been treated better by cash advance places. Seriously if you can take your money to any other bank do it."
Amy R.,"Easy to use, received funds quick and very convenient"
Stacie M. A. Wilkerson,Money lion has excellent service and they are fair and helpful they don’t put you through excessive fees and high interest rates. When you call customer service someone always answers and is very courteous!!
Mamie Mai,Great job easy to work the web site easy to get loans
Jason E Miller,The process was user friendly and very easy to follow.
Ryan Speer,"I've had my account with these folks for almost 3 years now and they were Excellent with direct deposits and instacash before they switched to Roarmoney! Now when I REALLY need and depend on my instacash advance they LOCK me out after I've paid back my prior advance. Now all of a sudden saying ""IT cannot detect that I get direct deposit?"" CRAZY! How is this when I've had same employer and direct deposit going in for the past 3 years and nothing has changed😡 So freaking pissed! I had utilities scheduled to come out my account today and now all they left me with is $8 in my account. No Heads up that Instacash wasn't going to be available so I could have made other arrangements. NO NOTHING! THEY'RE TELLING ME THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.??? How Not???? This is a WHOLE BANK AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHATS GOING ON WITH THEIR PRODUCT??? AND DON'T EVEN GIVE THE CONSUMER A HEADS UP???? THIS IS NOT GOOD BUSINESS PRACTICE AT ALL...VERY DISAPPOINTED CUSTOMER..NOT TRUST WORTHY FOLKS HERE..I WILL BE CLOSING MY ACCOUNT WITH THEM ASAP! SECOND TIME THEY'VE DONE THIS SINCE SWITCHING TO ROARMONEY MONEY..GARBAGE!!!!🤮👎👎👎👎👎"
robert,Love MoneyLion. I thought I closed my accounts with MoneyLion but for some reason they weren’t. So I’m logging into MoneyLion to give it another chance and realize that my investment account had been earning interest the entire time I thought the account was deleted also my instacash has significantly gone up which will be useful if needed. It shows you your credit scores and companies to provide loans. It’s come a long way from when I signed up.
isalina,"I think this app is okay, it definitely helps in a time of need, but they trick you a lot, you will randomly get a boost but when you have to pay it back you no longer get that boost, so you basically wasted $25 or however much the boost was. You must have to be already be really wealthy to be able to get a full $250 boost."
robert humphreys,"MoneyLion has been a trusted investment for me. I have been cash strapped several times and needed funds for emergency situations. Besides being a great financial resource, they are a company that thrives on seeing their members make wise financial decisions and  manage money better. They want to see to their members to succeed in the financial aspect of their lives. I have been a member for 4 years now. Ni hassles."
tonnie,I love this app and easy to receive instacash.
phillip,Great service easy to do all the way around!
💰🤑,I highly recommend Money Lion.  They have awesome customer service reps to answer your questions.  If you need quick cash Money Lion is there.
lamia,"Quick transfers, and really no complaints, except on the boosts maybe keep it on there til it gets used, seems like it’s on there right away after paying then few days later it’s gone"
L Simon,"I had reacently had a consern with MoneyLion after being told my Socical Security number was associated with a account already.  I was upset when the representative who took my call told me there was nothing that could be done. I posted this what was a negative review at the time in regards to that situation. Within 24 hours I was contacted by several different facets of MoneyLion to rectify this situation. Most inmortantly I was introduced to Kayala, over the last few weeks there have been several emails back and forth and too many missed calls to count. Kayala stuck  with me until ever issue was addressed and fixed. I am now currently active and able to use MoneyLion with no issues. Thank you so much for everyone who helped"
David Elder,"I really enjoy using moneylion, I get cash when I need and after I pay back its ready again in a few days, I haven't had any problems with them"
Wesley Mcgee,"They are horrible, they charge and take the fees out your account but it don’t post for 5-7 business days so it locks your account mid way, they dates for loans are based on your direct deposit day so if your original payday is Friday but your getting paid 2 days earlier the system puts that day and when getting paid up to 2 days it’s not a sure thing you mite get it 1 day earlier on Thursday but the system puts in for the day before and locks your account"
Nellita Love,I Love Moneylion and it's products! Money line has been key to my financial stabilization and Resurrection. Without Moneylion I would be financially lost in a deep dark abyss of financial brokenness and despair.Thank you Moneylion!

tyrone,"You charge $5 (a 20% fee)  for a $25 loan which is fine, but then give me guilt prompt saying to add a tip as well since tips are how how money lion is able to loan $25 dollars (as if the 20% fee is just for decoration) Also advertising a reference boost of $50 but when inquired on it I’m asked prolonging  questions like did I use the link (even though I made clear the my referral just told me to download the app & presumed i would add the bonus/coupon/referral in a add space like most companies have when using a referral bonus & questions like when did I get referred? When common sense would presume I was referred the same date as when I made the account? Since that’s basically what I was explaining? Then my phone dies while having a dead end conversation with an agent who seemed pretty Adamant on not granting the referral origin the advertised boost. Then when my phone charges no one is available to converse & even now I haven’t got a response to the email that I was suggest to message?"

annemarie,MoneyLion allowed an identity thief to take out a loan using my information.  I only learned about it when a delinquent payment appeared (and negatively impacted) on my credit report.  I have tried to report this and have found direct communication with the company’s fraud department impossible  It continues to remain unresolved after three phone calls with customer services reps who can do nothing (without the fraud department) and reports filed with the company. This company does not check credit profiles and does everything online basically making it a target for identity thieves.  They are a poorly run company and do very little to resolve issues like this where an innocent person has been harmed by their careless policies.SO MoneyLion just gave me the same BOT generated response to my issue.  They sent me that response in response to the same complaint on another website.  I did what MoneyLion asked providing more information online DIRECTLY to them and got no acknowledgement that they received it and OF COURSE NO RESPONSE FROM THEM.  This company sucks and am so frustrated.  They are truly truly unprofessional.  If I could give them less than 1 star I would.I wanted to provide an update on this complaint.  I have yet to hear from the Fraud Department (I don’t understand this) but I did get a response from a customer advocate at MoneyLion in response to this post and another post at the Better Business Bureau.  He said that they did confirm that the loan WAS fraud.  That I have no financial responsibility for it and that they have started the process of removing the loan from the credit agencies records.  I guess I am suppose to be happy about this and I do feel somewhat relieved but I still feel violated.  I will be happy when the records are corrected at the credit agencies and the harm that has been caused to my credit rating is undone. I will then remove the complaint from the Better Business Bureau  In the meantime I am surprised that the original complaint to the fraud department has NOT been answered by them.  Maybe they sent the communication to the person who took out the loan fraudulently or maybe there is an error in my email address.  I don’t know.  It would be terrific if the consumer advocate (whom I appreciate) who responded could inform the fraud department I have not gotten their official communication and let them know the correct email address  to send it to.
kenley,Very good app
Charisse Nicole,Super easy to use. Saved me a few times.
Emily Manhart,This is the best card I have had! I can get a cash advance and not pay all f the unnecessary fees that are tied to normal cash advances!!
Tess ,Best for people who are living pay check to pay check.

Donna Martin,This is a great service really helps out when I need it the only problem is when I decided I need it I need it right away and you can only take out $50 at a time and have to pay $4.99 every time you get it instantly even though I'm approved for $170 it's free if you wait two or three days but usually when I need it I need it now so to take out the whole are $170 I have to pay $20 in fees I wish that would change
christopher swinehart,Just try it and see for yourself

Erick D,Very easy to sign up and borrow money. Trustworthy.
redmia,This app is amazing and very easy to use. They give u instant loans when u need it. And they give u time to pay it off.
tia,"This is a great app. Lots of different ways to save and invest your money. It can be a little overwhelming with how many different loan and many saving tricks they provide. Lots of options to help guide you to getting a personal loan. I have not qualified for a MoneyLion loan but they connected me to several different loan companies that they are partnered with. I mostly use the MoneyLion app for the instacash feature. It has helped me on more than one occasion when I was low on funds and in between pay days. The only thing's I dislike about the instacash feature, no matter if you qualify for $200 instacash advance, they only allow you to advance money in $50 increments, each time you advance they ask for a tip between $0-$5 dollars. If you don't tip, they try and guilt you into leaving one, with a pop up picture of a little girl with a sad face, her hand out, and the words ""Are you sure you don't want to leave NO Tip??"" They charge a $4.99 Turbo fee if you want your cash deposited instantly to your debit card or bank account. It's $3.99 if you want it deposited to your MoneyLion debt card. They also offer the standard 2-3 business days delivery method, free. It's a good a great app easy to navigate. I just think it's a little absurd to only allow instacash with draws in $50 increments and charging fees and tips each time you make your $50 max with draw. Several other apps I use either charge a $9.99 flat monthly subscription fee, on qualified instacash withdrawals. Or they allow you to withdrawal entire qualified advance amount for a small fee to receive instantly."

Matthew Vanderhorst,"I'm honestly overly happy with moneylion. They give you the ability of a loan with having bad credit, they let you get advances when your money is low, if you haven't maxed out. And they are very supportive when they are open."
brad,Moneylion is a great service. They loan you money until your next payday with no interest or fees. You can choose whether to tip them or not. From $0 To $5. The tip amount is your choice.
Desi,I Am grateful for MoneyLion!!! The Instacash is always helpful!

Dan Mcclellan,"Helpful, awesome"
Melissa Too Strong Sargeant,It’s super convenient with a more than reasonable APR. It’s like Cash App but without the embarrassment of asking a loved one for money and so much better than a payday loan with an insane APR that takes a year to pay back.

chiefs KC,So far so great. Money lion upholds their end of the bargain.  Extremely satisfied so far.
Jennifer Verbic,Money Lion's a great back-up source when you're needing a quick fix to get you through the week.
Krista Nash,I love using money lion always helpful when I need it and I started investing with their plans I really enjoy using their service.
nathan,"Money Lion has the best/easiest credit building platform which is substantially helping me re-build my credit. They also have a great advance platform as well which includes “boosts” which are increases in the limit that one is allowed to advance. The ONLY negative Money Lion feature that I can say I’m not fond of is the way their advances are disbursed. (Ex. ML boosts increases your advancement limit to $200 and you’d like to borrow the full amount.. now you can withdraw that $200 in full but the way they have “advances” set up is max. $50 increments at a time. you can withdraw that $200 in 4 increments of $50 one after another immediately.. so you make 4 $50 requests meaning your to pay 4 tips and 4 fees.) i believe Money Lion members who pay $19.99/mo for membership should be able to withdraw their full advancement amount in one transaction. Regardless, I’m a huge fan of Money Lion and they’ve gotten me out of some ruts, and are helping me to improve my credit score. 5 Stars for ML"
jesse,Absolutely love money lion the only thing I don't like is you have to send money to your account more then once when you get the advance and each time they charge 4$ if you want it sent right there instead of a few days wish you can choose the payment you want in full instead of 50  and pay the extra 3.99 50and pay the extra 3.99  20 and pay the extra 3.99   Or what ever amount you have I get 120 and have to break down to 3 times of asking for advance to get the hole amount but other then that I love the app
Tammi Russell,Always there when I need them and then some.
Dawn,Best cash advance app there is. So easy to use.
Jennifer Perry,Best app. Fast service and customer service is helpful.
Janelle Caywood,Awesome system they have .   Much appreciated
Tonya,Very good excellent
Anthony Robertson,"It's not a lot and the instacash will cost you $5 if you get it to your account within a few hours, but when you just need a few bucks to get you to your next paycheck it works great! They repayment is also usually the next payday sometimes further so thats cool too!"
Momofboys,Very good and reliable business. That's helped me when I needed it most.
Kendra,Love this app works very good. The only problem I've had is I had to switch my debit card and since then it wont let me repay when I want I have to wait for it to be taken out by bank which takes a few days. Other than that no problems.
doeval,Overall a useful app but they could improve some minor things.
joseph,Not all cash apps are the same and some are just trying to take advantage of the people who live pay check to pay check. I have been with Money Lion for 3 years now and I can’t complain because I love the help I get with them they assisted me in helping me fix my credit. Lenders that might work with me. Awesome
evan,Awsome bank never switching. They just need crypto now
Jessica Materasso,Nice...very nice🙂

erika,This an amazing way to bank and make the app very user friendly .
Tiffany Purifoy,So far my experience with Money Lion is poor. Sadly it’s like Walmart can’t live with it can’t live without.
Javier Alvarez,"I love this app. So with this app, I am able to build my credit by showing that I have a good payment history. I have a credit building account where money is being put toward paying this credit builder ""loan"" off. I make a payment every two weeks on my payday which is taken out automatically, and I don't have to worry about get behind. The good news is once its paid off I get all my money back minus any fees of course. Then, they have Instacash which is way better than a payday loan. I borrow what I need and tip them the amount I want, and the cash is ready available. There are different options on how to receive the money, but you will have to use the app to see how it works. It is definitely worth it."
Dianna,Great app. Always there when I need help.

RJ,Great no problem no restrictions great app love it
tiffany,"I had an instacash repayment of $332 deducted from my bank account twice. I tried for 3 weeks for money lion to reimburse me, and it was only after I filed a claim with my bank that money lion credited me back one of the payments. But immediately following that, money lions system showed this credit as money borrowed and tried to collect again! They even removed the duplicate deduct from my transaction history, but luckily I have screenshots of all my transactions for legal purposes. Please be mindful that recovering money from this company will be a hassle."
Mary,"I would like to file this complaint against MoneyLion who acted very dishonestly with my credit report today where they flagged my credit builder account 30 days past due where 56 points dropped from my credit report and I want it to be clear to them and rectify my credit report right away.l or I am gonna file a lawsuit against them to respect people. They have a very bad product which called Creditbuilder which is a fake product that they use to raise money and destroy people's credit reports.They allow you to pay 500$ With 21$ pay payment, I started this with them where I paid them 118$ which is not something I owed them but giving it to them to help build back my credit.Anytime I wanna pay that 21$ their system doesn’t allow my payment and it’s a real bank account and debit card money .I contacted them to let them know about the issue but they never replied me today I contacted them in order to fix the payment issue instead of doing that they flagged my credit report."
Veronica ,Amazing u get the money so quick I really recommend this app if u r ever in money troubles
megan,Best service I've received in a long while!
Steven West,"Love how quickly they sent money (I think it took a day to confirm my account info but the deposits are instant after that) And they offer up to $140 even of its your first time using them. Other platforms start lower (usually $50). They do charge $15 if you take the whole $140 so that’s a bit pricey, but still worth it in a pinch."
Donte Mitchell,"The best service for loans and building credit that  I know. Love the fast, affordable, and easy way to use this app and service."
nikia,A bless to me .since i got this membership i have access to cash advances 0% interest and never pay an overdraft fee period .

Sharon Drake,"Best app ,easy, convenient, fast and reliable.. best part is that it has improved my credit!!"

Shell ,"This is the best bank I have ever worked with. Loans, cash advance, cash back on purchases. Unbeatable!"
tanysha,The loan I got didn’t help me pay anything of my bills. I feel scammed. Explaining that a loan will only give you certain money and the other you can’t touch should have be the first thing explained. I would’ve never accepted this loan if I knew.

Although they have some things to work on I believe they actually took the time to take a look and fix things with me thus the update of my review. Thank you moneylion I appreciate it"

This new and innovative approach to banking, helping customers with their credit, savings and investments and lending a helping hand with small loans in between paychecks. This new approach to online banking and putting the customer above all else is unprecedented to my knowledge of the traditional banking methods. I highly recommend giving it a try. You will not be disappointed. I can’t wait to see what they have in store for the future as they are constantly adding new fun and information features to the site. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️+⭐️!!!!"
Paula Buckley ,I linked my bank account for instacash and it keeps saying no linked banks. This is a scam do not use their service.

david,Money Loin very good. Been there when my pockets was a little light
heather,"I enjoy using moneylion, it's great, I use it every time and I get boost often, anyone will enjoy a little extra cash often."
EDWARD,"MoneyLion is very helpful with loans and helping you build your credit. However, like the other Short term loan apps, the program uses a logarithm to determine your payday. I received an off cycle bonus and it totally threw off my repayment schedule. I ended up paying for fees after only one week and then any money that I needed for the next cycle was again due in a week. When I addressed it with them, I was told nothing could be done. It’s very frustrating."
Mera,It’s a great application to borrow money from before pay day.
Robert F,"Moneylion has come through for me when I have had some financial emergencies come up. Also, allows me to build up credit."
heidi,Basically I'm very pleased with the app.I have my paycheck direct deposit.However every time I go to Insta cash it asks metoset up direct deposit..It's minor but does frustrate me.
tirrell,Easy to request loan and comply with their rules. You can also request a loan right after repaying the last one. I use it here and there in emergencies and absolutely love their app ease.

Jonathan Woolsey,Excellent experience
michael,"MoneyLion has been a great asset to me.  When I first began to use it, it took a while to become eligible for a loan or Instacash but once those perks kicked in it is fantastic.  The fastest processing of any of the ""cash advance"" type apps I have found.  Literally within minutes of paying your previous advance back, you can get a new one if needed."
bj,Wonderful  got what was needed
crystal,"I like the instacash program.  My only beef is that unable to remove bank I no longer use and debit card fee is steep. If someone needs extra cash they can't afford a 4.99 fee.  Same goes with leaving a tip, ridiculous."
james w beard,Great work appreciate the instacash only downfall is they don't accept chime for unlocking a loan
Josh Johnson,I appreciate you being there for my financial needs and to stretch my money when I most need it. It's there when I otherwise would be desperate and without any where.

jeremy,MoneyLion Instacash is Awesome! It’s always there when I need it for extra to pay bills especially now that the past year was really really hard and now 2021.The  Instacash feature has really helped my family through this trying time.
As,So far good only thing that you can only do $50 each time with a $4.99 fee each transactions plus an tip I ending paying $35 extra for fees and tips in a $250 but other then that customer service is excellent everytime I call always friendly and are there to help
Ken Ireland,Moneylion has been my full financial support for the past year. The customer service is always available my call is not on hold for too long. The problems are resolved very smoothly. My credit builder loans are fair and have been the reason for a raising credit score giving me an advantage for me necessary spending.  I have no complaints the credit builder grows as you finish the loan all with the membership payment every montH. Having instacash is an option that can save you any cloudy day.
susan,Always there when needed !!! Never wait for payday again it’s truly amazing
Jade Myers,Thank you for all the easy loans!!
m Gonzalez ,"The daily limit to withdraw is not the greatest. And then if I withdraw from an ATM... Any other transaction after that withdraw is immediately denied and refunded due to protection. I need an account and card that won't get ""locked for my security"" every time I get paid and pay bills."
Tony Mahoney,I really love MoneyLion because it helps me keep my money on track.

joshua,"MoneyLion has been so helpful. I needed cash between pay periods when I was moving.  I was skeptical at first but after doing research and seeing other positive reviews, I gave it a try. The process is so easy and there are no hidden fees on any kind. The loan is very easy to pay back."
Autumn,They are quick and reliable.  When your payment is made you can still instacash the same day.  Excellent app
amanda,So far I have nothing to complain about. Very user friendly app.
Ashley,"Moneylion is a great app and money management bank. I’ve been using the app for almost 2 years and rarely find problems. If I do run into a problem or have a question regarding my account or Instacash, I always get a timely response and fixed solution."

Johnnette,Very Outstanding ! Without A Doubt👍
kayla,"Moneylion, definitely there when you need it."
evan,Love the instacash and credit repair loan. Dont even get me started on the recent shareholder agreement. Very much positively involved in customers financial lives. Never forgetting that there wouldn't be a moneylion with out its loyal customers.
kelly,"It's great if you need money in a pinch, and the investment portfolio's and credit builder loans are awesome. But for the instant cash you can't even take out limit. You have to do it in segments and each segment charges a fee for turbo and they strongly suggest tipping them.. however there are tons of things you can do and the have whole lists of opportunities to make/get/borrow/earn money! Suffice to say I have been enjoying my Moneylion account and it's freedoms and perks along with it! Thanks Moneylion!!"
ashley,I've been using money lines insta cash for the past 4 months along with credit builder Plus and roar money. I move my direct deposit to my checking there and paid everything on time. So I make my instash payment for the month and then go to try and use it well my limit have been cut in half and the payment was made on the due date and was not late. So anyways it was cut in half and I couldn't figure out why well after a little research I find that there's no proof of any of my direct deposits so it was like I was a new customer again. So I call Mr Cash to try and figure out why and if they can somehow and pretty much got told that that's how it is and maybe next month well that doesn't really fix the fact that I was really kind of depending on that oh and my repayment date had gotten changed also and was two weeks from the long day instead of the normal. I have been a pretty good customer and have paid quite a bit of money in fees and tips just last month was 65 I think in fees and tips anyways I don't think that was very fair of them at all and if it was the other way around they wouldn't accept me telling them to just pretty much deal with it and I sent a complaint email and haven't heard anything yet and I'm sorry but just not at all impressed at all and will probably end up moving all my stuff to a different bank because of it so that's my thoughts on money line in insta cash
Nikki Nonstop,Pretty good customer service!
Mori Swafford,It’s like a helping hand
Shantell Penn,"MoneyLion has helped me get back on my feet when I most needed someone to believe in me. With their help I've been able to moving forward and help me get my credit back on track, so thank you for your support."
J Thomas,I thoroughly enjoy this app! The Credit Builder Plus Loan has helped to boost my score! The instacash is perfect when you're low on funds before your next paycheck! It is all reported in your credit!
margaret,Wonderful company
Joseph,Your company is the best credit loan bank!
Anthony Bannister,Couldn’t figure out why I was unable to login. Finally got a customer service rep that figured out what the problem was and immediately fixed it.
Brandi Colton,"I am an outstanding customer, I pay on time every week in Full, with Tips. Which brings me too my point. I don't like the fact that every advance is in multiple's of $45-$50 and Everytime you want a Tip. Why can't you guys just let me pick how much I want for an Advance, for example, $190. And let me Tip on that one transaction. 4 separate advances + tips ends up costing me a fortune. But Thank you for your service that you provide. Just wanted to throw out an idea for Loyal customers such as myself!!"
Sammi Kanamu,Good to have in a bind and always on time
brandon,"I love money lion!! It has definitely saved me financially many times! They are great, professional, and very human on how they do business."
Michael Warrick,Very satisfy with your srvice.  Great banking with you
Mitchell Peavy,"I like this app. Helps me build credit, save and let's me borrow money when needed until my pay day"
Brittany Moore,"I think MoneyLion is great! The only thing I don't like is the fact if you use Instacash, they make you pay the whole amount in a week. If payment plans were available, then this app and service would truly be perfect."
Jay,"MoneyLion is a great service to me, they really have helped me in my need. The only thing I dislike is instead of giving you the instant money all at once they give it to you in a separate form. Say for instance you qualify for a $100 and you will get charged for each $50 to get that $100 or for every $25 until you get the $100. I understand you guys have to make your money to and trying to give to the next person that may need it as well. I am just glad to get the help that I may need. Thank You MoneyLion for your help and for what you do for other people."
Karen,You guys are great money Lion has got me out of some financial spots when I didn't know what to do
shawn,it's Good for Online Business

tiffany,Money lion helped me in a HUGE way when I needed it most . Thank u so much.
Napoleon Savinon,MoneyLion is an honest and truthful app. Does not automatically enroll you into some type of subscription like many other programs. It has saved me time and time again in some tricky situations thanks to COVID.

joanna,saves my butt every week. cough amazon.
jeffrey,"You advertise about bad credit loans, etc but that's not true. Customers who apply and get turned down they are sent to another company, then another and all you receive is junk emails telling you to submit your request, then another site, on top of that you get the countless bs phone calls from spammers and fraudulent people/companies all day, everyday. It's not right and it's not just your site that does it....We have rights too no matter bad credit or not, we deserve respect as well. Thank you"

nevaeh xgemelke,Awesome services. Definitely would recommend.
Carlos Morales,I was very pleased with this service i will continue to use it
Brandilyne Beamon,The fee that is charged to get the money and then they want you to also leave a tip that is not far
melissa,"The best lending/budgeting app around (I’ve also used Dave, Empower, FloatMe, Bridgit, and Vola). My hours were cut significantly during the pandemic and this app kept me from going hungry and getting too far behind on rent. Best in terms of amount(as long as I’ve been relatively on time) as they reward timely repayment with increased borrow amounts. They won’t overdraft your account if you’re balance won’t cover on the repayment date. Quite flexible and no crazy or hidden fees."
Meta Johnson,Thank you for your service always there for me thank you once again Five star
Jlp,MoneyLion you are the best love what you guy do you guys deserve more than 5 stars
brian,Very fast and convenient. Very helpful when needed and get your cash instantly

luwanna,Great to have when you are in between paydays
michael,Very happy with money lion very helpful
tracy,"Money Lion insta-cash has been a life saver for me!!  Being retired & disabled I have to manage my money vvveerryy carefully.  Until the pandemic I subsidized my modest income with ""side jobs"" from my former Accounting career.  That came to a screeching halt when Covid hit.  Being high risk I couldn't see clients in my home office any longer...  It came down to paying the utilities or eating!  I'm NOT kidding!!  In all my years I'd never been in this position.  Had it not been for ML Insta-cash tiding me over til assistance could arrive I don't know what I would have done.  I'm so grateful & humbled.  It was an added bonus not having to pay ANY interest on the advances as well.  Thank You Money Lion, I'm not a wealthy client but I am a loyal one!!"
customer,"When it comes to disputing things that aren't correct they debate on if they want to give you your money back or let whoever took it keep it. Then it takes literally fourteen days to get a new card, the virtual card only works in limited stores and grocery stores. It's not an all out card like they say it is. Secondly the staff doesn't seem to grasp the urgency or magnitude of someone's issue their having. Sadly I been a card user for nearly two and a half years but over the past 3 months the service and customer support has been so terrible I have been ready to go back to my primary banking account and cut ties with Moneylion all together. When trying to apply for loans it doesn't let you update your account if you've lost access. It forces you to try to get your old account information over and over again."
camesha,Can't access full amount after successfully repaying
bridgette,I haven't had moneylion very long but so far I can say I love it! It's very easy to use and the shake n bank is really cool! I definitely prefer this over my last bank for direct deposit. I have recommended it to a few people and the people I've seen use this as payment at work all say they like it!
