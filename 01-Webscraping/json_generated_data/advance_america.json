So I needed Cash to cover me til I got my first check and Alicia helped me out and explained everything and was courteous and helpful in my desperate embarrassing situation. Even when I wasn't sure I what day I was going to get paid that week they let me know that I would be ok and gave me a day or 2 just in case. Then after I got my direct deposit from my job I came it to pay my payment in full and Alison took care of me and I decided to get another loan that was much easier for me to do and for some reason their system wasn't taking my bank account number and I thought I wouldn't be able to do it and Alison was so patient and helpful and we both figured that I was missing 2 digits extra and she put it in and it worked (besides I learned something new to make sure I have the 2 other digits I need for my account lol ) I really enjoyed these 2 ladies professionalism and courteous attitudes they shown and understanding of my situation. I really appreciate it cause it goes along way. Can't thank them enough and will recommend other's who are in their own situations.",

I have noticed quite a few times when I try it will get to the page that shows my total monthly income of my social security disability but on the same page it shows my 3 month and it is too low so not sure if that has anything to do with it.  This month I must have tried 4 times kept ending up saying to upload documents and I gave up. Plus then stopped at the local office and they were out to lunch and when I came back after they were to be open they still weren't there and there were 4 people waiting outside.  Then a day later all of a sudden the loan was in my account.  Something isn't right.  This was I believe started on 10/1/22 , stopped twice at the office on Monday Oct 3rd but didn't stay after second attempt nor did I have contact with employees. And it appeared in my account on October 4th.",

I have been trying for over 2 weeks to get a increase on a loan I had been paying in good faith even in hardships, but at one point there was a missed payment, by one day, 2 months ago due to their fault of not automatically drafting it. I paid the next day when ai realize it wasn‚Äôt drafted, but they said it takes 6 on time payments to even be considered a increase. My next one was around the corner making it my 6th, I paid it a few days earlier to see if that would help and still no answers, nor help.These guys are not the go to guys for loans anymore, I would say. They‚Äôve had enough time and a early payment should have definitely meant something, but doesn‚Äôt in their eyes. Forget Advance America at this point. There are better ones than them. Will never go to Advanced America again!",

I decided that I needed another one, so I came to Advance America first because I had a good experience with my previous loan.  I anticipated this being a quick and easy process, but that was not the case, as it turned out. When I first submitted my new application (nothing had changed), I was initially offered $1500.  As it turned out, I only needed about $900 but it was good to be offered more than I needed.  As I went through the process, and came to the bank verification, the system never could connect with my bank, so I decided to follow the alternate route of sending in my check stub (pay advice).  I sent it in as directed, and suddenly I was only offered $150.  This was very frustrating and I could find no reason for the dramatic decrease in my offer.  Even after calling customer service, they just said there was nothing they could do about the amount offered, and they refused to look any further into the matter.  I was quite disappointed in customer service.  I still do not understand why the offer was so low, but I was in a bind, so I went ahead and accepted the offer of $150.  Can you explain why all of this happened?I would love to revive my confidence in using this company in the future.",

Then the clerk had presented me with a line of credit, which she I could barely hear her, and she kind of sped through the loan. They do all agreements online, which I signed on this tiny device. I went online to check the account which I thought the interest rate was reasonable. I though this was cool and had planned on paying off the loan in two installments. I didn't realize they were charging me an exorbitant interest rate, and the loan amassed $375.45 in interest charges in the first month. Initially, only $25 was shown to have been applied to the principal. I missed the first payment, then I paid towards the second payment. They started generating random checks each month without my knowledge or permission, a few days prior to the due date to ensure that they receive their money on time. I had other bills that I needed to attend to, and their collection practices are predatory. I found out that the state I live in, they weren't supposed to have me as a customer. I'm in another state. I'm glad that I will no longer be using them as a lender, nor will I recommend them to anyone else. When they took my loan into default, I was under the impression that they were to negotiate with me on making a payment arrangement. The loan went into default after one month of being late. If I could give them zero stars, I would. According to the CFPB this type of behavior from a predatory lending institution is not uncommon. Once, I've made arrangements to take care of this bill, I will never do business with this company ever again.",

Paying by credit card is a more efficient way for a customer to make payments online and on time without delays!

My daughter received her money on August 10 without her referral incentive. I called again to customer care and was placed on a 29 minute hold before I hung up. They keep saying that the money was sent. However whenever I checked my account, the $200 deposit was not there. Then, Advance America continues to send me ways to pay back the money! That's not going to happen because I never received the money. Called them several times and I still don't have the money. At least give my daughter her $20 that you SAID you would for her referral (me).This company has continued to tell me that they're so sorry about that!

Definitely appreciate the loan but I'm still in awe over her professionalism, patient, skill level and just such an upbeat attitude, and that's coming from someone who's worked in customer service while customer facing for a few years and she did waaaay better than me! Although I've made this whole review about the representative I just feel it's super important to have reps customer facing like that because that positive energy will bring in more business and I can honestly say I'll be returning because of the customer service I received was so amazing!

It was necessary for me to rescind the loan within the 3 business days provided by law, and made possible by a dear friend. It left me wondering --what has all this \"payday lnder reform\" accomplished?  Perhaps the interest rates are lower cumulatively. but the payments per 500$ loan have more than doubled which is prohibitive for people like myself on fixed income. Micro-loans are a needed and necessary part of a sane society that acknowledges the terrible wealth gap. But whoever pushed for middle class laws affecting the poor left common sense and affordability of repayment completely out of the equation. ADVANCE should be proud of the professionalism of their employees--but however the only loans proffered to me by computer algoritms did not adjust  to lower monthly rrepayment, becasue when the amount borrowed was decreased, the payback term of payment also decreased..VOILA! virtually the same cost to repay a smaller loan rather than longer time to repay resulting in smaller monthly repayment  increments Not user friendly , Advance.

I explained to your associate I did not own a vehicle or house and had no title for a title loan. They explained to me if I were to successfully complete 4 payday loans I could apply for a small(no title)personal loan upon completion of my 4th payday loan I asked 'bout applin' for a small personal loan and was told Advance America does not grant such loans in the state of Indiana that it had to be a title loan. I spoke extensively to your associate before my first loan and durin' the course of my 4 payday loans and not once was I told your company only does title loans in Indiana.

When I got there it was apparently closed for lunch with the sign indicating that it would not reopen for over an hour. Some people had been waiting for a half hour when I got there. When a worker returned I had been there for a half hour, others over an hour. What really cheesed everyone off was the fact that they didn‚Äôt reopen for another 10 minutes or so and apparently there had been someone inside all along and she breezily told us it would be about 15 more minutes as she apparently was just going to lunch. By the time the young lady finally reopened, there were about 8 of us waiting outside in the heat, one lady almost passed out. I‚Äôve never seen crap like this in one of your stores before and if I experience anything like it again I‚Äôm taking my business elsewhere. I don‚Äôt know what the problem is with keeping help, but if you‚Äôre going to train somebody after a holiday weekend, especially when most people couldn‚Äôt re-borrow because of Michigan law and had to wait until the weekend was over, you should at least take that into consideration and staff accordingly.

This experience was so bad that I refuse to go to that location which was a half mile from my house and traveled 15 miles to get good service.  I contacted the BBB and left a review on Google  about this terrible experience.  I was contacted by the \"Pissed Consumer\" website about making a video about my treatment and how you guys never responded to this lady's terrible attitude about a complaint about a computer problem.

That was too long. I tried for some time to cancel the unfinished online loan process, but could not find a way to do it. Then I drove to Advance America on West El Camino, and was told they could not give me a payday loan because I already had a loan  \"IN PROCESS\" and I would have to drive home and finish it.    So I did, but was too upset to safely drive back to West El Camino, which is quite a distance away. So I went the next day and it was closed in the middle of the day. So then I drove back today and they said my loan went thru, but they didn't have any cash. . I asked it they could just deposit it in my bank account, but was told that he couldn't do that unless I  called the number he gave me and cancelled the loan. I tried to do that outside in the parking lot, but the Advance America lady on the line told me that \" YES, THEY COULD CANCEL THE LOAN IN PERSON AT EL CAMINO\", so I went back in. They couldn't, or maybe they just didn't know how.  So I ended up driving up and down Stockton Blvd for 45 minutes to find the other store in the heat. I had to call 3 times for direction, but at least they had the cash.    HOW IN THE H--- CAN A PAYDAY ADVANCE PLACE (West El Camino) RUN OUT OF CASH????? IT WAS STILL MORNING! And NO, they could not just transfer the loan to my bank. You folks must be really hard up for capable workers.This is way too much trouble to do business with Advance America.

How fair is that?The terms and conditions are carefully designed to make it very difficult to make the required payments on time for customers who are already struggling to survive. There needs to be a balance between your company making a profit and really helping those in need.

I Have to say I never thought my review would be noticed but I've been proved wrong I was contacted by Christy O'Neal from the Tulsa Oklahoma office and she was sorry to hear my bad review and explained to why I couldn't pay off My loan early and it was due to me using a debit card and that they had been getting frauded by debit  cards it turns out I could have paid off the loan in person with a check , cashier's check or money order but I was doing it over the phone and wasn't told why I couldn't pay it off early. so just want to say Thank You to Christy O'Neal for contacting me and making it right . so If you need a loan I recommend advance America  they'll do you right",

Also saw her handle a problem customer, who had been told numerous times that he needed a bank statement showing a positive balance, not a letter that he brought from the bank. From what I saw, she has told this man over and over again like 5 times, different days, and he just don't get it. He was waiting in lobby for his turn, and she asked him if he had his bank statement, no but I got this letter,  she said I'm sorry sir, but we have been through this many times, which then she was backed up by another saying, sir we have told you everytime you come in here, we cannot use that paper and you have been told what we need.

I was able to make a online loan twice and after that I have had difficulty. It tells me that I need to change my password which I did. Customer service assisted me. But I am still unable to do an online loan. So if you guys could work The Kinks out of that I think everything will be spectacular. I have talked to others that have had similar problems with the online loan. Your company is wonderful to us who are hard-working people and who live on fixed incomes. Thank you so much",

Makes it very hard to pay off an installment loan when you've paid $1400 and the balance has gone down by $200. Other than that, these loans are very easy to get and the funding is instant. Also you can make a debit card payment online instead of waiting for the ACH to go through and it applies the payment immediately. If you can pay off fast and save yourself alot of the interest its a good deal but if you can only make the minimum payment you will end up paying 4 times what you borrowed.",

She found the right loan option for my needs, and I left with a solution. That is what Ms. Cordova is an expert at doing! Finding a financial solution for her customers in their time of need!

I didn't ask her this time, because I've come to the conclusion that if she isn't vaccinated by now, nothing I could say (or nag about) would change that. I was just glad there was a see-through divider and I could keep my mask on without being harassed. I do wish Advance America would require vaccination of its employees, but that's life in America; it seems, that my understanding of common sense is not the understanding of the common sense of others.

She said YES but gave me the customer service number to call in my payment.  Well today is MONDAY and no customer service rep can take my payment (not in system) and the local branch has no way to do it either (her systems are ONLY for lines of credit). I applied for the Line Of Credit which is $1000 BUT you can‚Äôt give me ANYTHING of that until my PayDay loan is paid.  I am going out of state on Wed and needed more funds before I left.

She apologized telling me she would call me back. She did, at which time the policy regarding loans was explained professionally with the kindness I wish all CSRs had. I met her the next day, paid the balance of the open loan and was approved for another. Your company helped once more. I am most thankful, as is the dog, the Vet, all pet lovers! who do what we can to ensure the health of our pets. By the way, she was better in person than on the phone. GREAT EXPERIENCE!",

To say the least the representative acted as if she didn't want to wait on me. The store had a be back at 3:00pm sign on the door and I arrived at 3:10pm the representative told. E she was still on break but would assist me. I should have left at that point, but gave it a try. The representative made it a point to me that all their customers get checks we don't keep cash. Not friendly at all. I should have known because it has been my experience that mostly all the people in the Winnsboro area are rude and unprofessional. I will Not go back to that location again. The two at the Two Notch Road location are very friendly from the time they unlock the door until they finish your transaction. Winnsboro has a bad representation for visitors and customer service.

Come the next day, I reached out and asked if there was anything else I needed to do (again, had not and still haven‚Äôt received what was needed). I was informed an ID was needed. So I put that in. Later that day around 4:45 - 5 - I logged back in and it said it was approved! Awesome! It may take a little time. Then it tells me it won‚Äôt be available until the next business day (and weekends aren‚Äôt business days). After that, the site updates to tell me due to Mondays holiday, they won‚Äôt come through that day either. So now I will (maybe) be receiving the money into my account literally three days before I‚Äôm supposed to pay it back. How is that ok? Why was I not informed BEFORE hand? The site said nothing about that until after 5 on Friday. I can‚Äôt talk to anyone about it because you guys were closed all weekend apparently. I‚Äôd already  applied and was approved so I couldn‚Äôt go somewhere else, which forced me to have to wait, in silence, to hopefully be able to call on the 18th and explain the situation. I‚Äôll be honest, I was super relieved at first when it went through, then I found out all the other information and it instantly made me feel far worse. My opportunities were taken and I feel like the company took complete advantage of me in my time of need. I‚Äôm seriously upset about this. I didn‚Äôt need the money on Tuesday, on Monday, noR Sunday. I needed it Thursday or Friday, Saturday at the latest. Not a whole week later. At this point, it‚Äôs going to cost me even more money to borrow this money, AND I still got hit with late fees. Literally, this whole process and the lack of transparency has cost me about $150 in fees, not including the fee for this. I‚Äôm in a worse spot than I was. I really do feel like this was done predatorily. I‚Äôm not the only one who experienced this, and it makes me think it was done purposefully. The lack of communication, the fact I had to reach out to find out what else was needed, the fact the site said nothing about the 17th until after the fact, etc. I‚Äôm not trying to be rude, but this has caused a lot of problems when it should have been helping to solve them.",

My experience with the online system and online application process, not so much. The online system was terrible, hard to navigate, not user friendly, and very aggravating. Not to mention the fact that after being lead to believe the loan was a done deal, there was additional verification I had to go through, which caused me to have to take more time out of my day, and undergo more stress.

I was told there was nothing that could be done but I could purchase another loan the next day to help.

Upon arrival at the bank the ink was so smeared and illegible that the bank would not accept the check.  Upon return to the store I was told there was nothing that could be done until Monday.  On Monday I was informed that we had to wait 24 hours for the cancelation on the check. Staff should have informed me the location was closing before processing any loan information/paperwork to ensure I wanted to proceed.  The check printed and issued to me should not have and issue with smearing or rubbing off, like it did.  I should not have to had to wait 4 days to ensure the transaction had been cancelled and all business issues resolved.

Also this company doesn't even give the customer time to get paid, they take the money in the middle of the night before you have a chance to collect your paycheck & deposit it.I won't be using this company in the future.Thank you for your help,Sincerely; April Lepe",

        "name": "Ray",
        "reviews": "This is coming from a real Advance America customer, not a bot, not a paid client or anything else. I am a single mother of two teenage daughters. I live off of and support my family with my income as a teacher (which everybody knows doesn‚Äôt mount to a hill of beans unfortunately), but nothing else. I don‚Äôt receive child support or have income coming in from anywhere else. My rent is nearly half my monthly take home pay, so as you can imagine, money is beyond tight, and Lord help me when an emergency arises. I would get so far behind on everything if the slightest unexpected financial obligation popped up. I‚Äôm still working on building my credit from a divorce, so bank loans are not in the cards for me right now. The first time I became in dire straits, I searched and researched every possible avenue for finding a small loan to help me support my family and get me back were I needed to be. The best option I found to fit my needs was Advance America. The initial loan process was a bit tedious, but that‚Äôs only because I‚Äôm pretty introverted and I‚Äôm uncomfortable speaking to people in person at times. In reality and for everyone else, the initial process is a cakewalk lol. I have used Advance America since that first loan, and it‚Äôs been as easy as uploading a picture of my paystub and hitting ‚Äúsend‚Äù. I love that I don‚Äôt have to go through all the verification steps anymore. It‚Äôs so simple and they are always there for me in my time of need. The fees associated with the loans are by far the most reasonable fees anyone in my position could ever find. If I was an accountant, I‚Äôm sure I would be appalled by the fees, but then again if I was an accountant, I would be more financially stable and wouldn‚Äôt need Advance America either, so for me, I don‚Äôt mind paying the fees because it‚Äôs worth it when I need it. Anyone who complains about the fees honestly just needs to more appreciative and grateful that they are as low as they when compared to other payday loan companies. You won‚Äôt find any other company who‚Äôs fees are as reasonable as Advance America‚Äôs, who‚Äôs loan process is simple and quick, who can fund your account as quick, or who‚Äôs payback date is far out enough to give you the time to get yourself financially comfortable again. Advance America is a life saver. I highly, very very highly recommended them for anyone who finds themselves in my situation. It‚Äôs not a hand out, it‚Äôs a hand up, and they don‚Äôt take advantage of people in their times of vulnerability like the vast majority of payday, title, or small loan companies do. If you‚Äôre reading this review trying to compare other companies, or just deciding whether or not to pull the trigger on using Advance America for your loan needs, I‚Äôm here to say look no further and don‚Äôt hesitate. You will feel that relief that you so desperately need, and it‚Äôs not just an instant gratification then regret it later kind of relief either. It‚Äôs a thank Goodness for Advance America kind of feeling of relief that will not leave you ending up feeling disappointed. Honest review from a real customer here. I want to stress that because I know reviews can be misleading. I‚Äôm not here to mislead anyone, I‚Äôm leaving this review to help others who find themselves in desperate times like I have found myself in many times.",

Like you can not pay with both cash and debit card, its all one or the other. At Advance America, no worries, pay however you want. I had this issue first week in December where I could not pay my loan with \"the other guys\" and decided its just a hassle to do business here now. This is my second loan with Advance America and its been nothing but 5 stars and true customer service and satisfaction right from the start. On this particular loan, I dealt with Allen who far exceeded all expectations. Not only did he allow me to pay my loan with cash and 2 debit cards, which got the job done, his particular location closes at 2pm on Saturday. Not only did Allen stay late with another customer and myself still in the store, he still answered any phone calls that came into this location. He was on the ball, extremely professional, helped me beyond what you would expect, made sure I was able to pay my loan and apply for another and he moved with such precision that I was not sure how he did everything so fast. Kudos to Allen for all of his efforts. Unlike the other guys\" who start yelling at you if you were to walk into their location at say 145pm and they close at 2pm, to get out, they have to close at 2pm on the dot, etc. You get the idea. Doing business with Advance America is well, like a new America, where you are not just a loan or a number but are actually treated with the respect and dignity one would hope to be a recipient of from any payday loan company. Advance America has got the right vision looking forward and they obviousily train and instill into their employees, these same visions and how to treat another human  being and one that had something happen in their lives which brought them into the lobby of a payday loan lender. It is not the easiest thing to do and you have to swallow your pride but one has to do what one has to do. I expected no this, no we can't do that, etc. when I left the location of \"the other guys\" and came over to this Advance America location. Allen did not utter a single no to me and it was yes we can, yes we can, yes we can and I am happy to say I left with the new loan I needed to sustain my present living conditions.",

Advance America  stands alone as the NUMBER 1 loan company. They are the most professional, clear on terms,will work with you if needed , most expedient and  trust worthy. The team members there are the greatest and the service I always receive by A.Rodriguez  (3676) is very exceptional Advance America should be proud to have her as a team member.

I only needed to get through 5 more days of the month but the same fee was applied. I am extremely happy with the service in spite of the one issue. Perhaps Advance America will consider implementation of a lessor fee for situations like mine in the future. If so I would have to give 10 stars! The website is easy to navigate and the response was immediate. Also, after approval, if the funds were not deposited right away I had (have) the option of canceling online and then applying again at the Advance America store near my home to receive the cash much sooner. I did not have to do this because luckily the funds I applied for Sunday night were deposited the next business day mid afternoon. Thank you! Please consider my suggestion for a lessor fee for loans paid back within 5 to 15 days! Respectfully A.C. Santa Barbara, Ca.",

Living on Social Security I really couldn't afford to lose this kind of money. Once I gave up they told me I wouldn't be reimbursed for my expenses of $1100 because I didn't receive the loan. I should mention that one of the reasons I had to purchase so many cards was after purchasing and sending the cards through both email or text message I was told the card was invalid. I checked the value of the last card I sent and 2 hours after Advance America confirmed they received the card, there were 3 transactions made (for $99.98 each) for one specific merchant. The card then had a value of $.06. Out of 6 cards I purchased either online or in store, only 2 of them were good according to Advance America.

The only thing I wish is that after a patron has proved themselves worthy with good payback history, they could increase the amount that you could borrow a little bit even if they had to break the payments up in two months instead of one I've often thought that I could use a little bit more than 450 and I've been an excellent Patron as far as paying back.

They do not work with you on this, they will not use any of the other sending money options that are well known and trusted, not even to gain a customer. One of the questions in the beginning of the process was if I use bitcoin. I said no, and asked why they ask that, and they would not respond to that. Then later I asked if they are a company that sells bitcoin, they stated no, but would not work with me any other way. Complete waste of time, and not good customer service at all. I spoke with Jason Green, Sr. Loan Analyst who just kept saying ok, ok, ok, ok.... I would not recommend this company to a person even if they were a last resort.

Then they sent it somewhere within their business and told me to wait for an e-mail that was suppose to arrive between 24 and 48 hrs. I waited 24hrs and contacted them twice each time their hands were tied and i was told to wait for e-mail..RENT WAS DUE so i called Advance America and spoke with Emily here in Redding. She let me know what paper work was needed for Verification. Because i kept all that important stuff together already i was at the store in 30mins.Thinking to myself oh god here we go again, something always goes wrong or back home for different papers. My mind was blown when we were done and i was out the door in under 30mins... They really stepped up when i needed it.. Thanks Advance America    Larry",

Came in person in October 2021 after going to a competitor for a few months. Was given twice what the other place gave me, and up to 4 months to pay it back. I was loaned one-third of my gross monthly pay, based on your last paycheck only. Different man waited on me than on the phone, equally as professional. Nice to see all employees wearing masks and hand sanitizer for the clients. They have revolutionized the short term loan industry. Will recommend to friends. My advice to you, pay back early if you can or pay a little more than due each time so they are at least charging interest on a smaller amount, as you are saving a lot in interest if you do. You really do not want to pay that interest.",

There was a problem and your system said I still had an open loan but SoM said they were all closed with the new online loan open. The store manager Lisa was on hold for 40 minutes with customer service trying to get this resolved. She never got through. Driving back to Michigan was a huge waste of a day.

The first problem was I called the customer assistance number to get onto a government payment plan for my online loan. After being on hold for 51 MINUTES  I was finally disconnected. And this is since I gave up and just really long which cost me a extra $30-$40. Next, was a mistake made by a customer assistance operator. I called in to once again get on a payment plan (I couldn‚Äôt make it to the store) this time for my in-store loan.  I had just taken out an online loan about 2 to 3 hours earlier. I talk to the customer care assistant and they said they could put it on a payment plan no problem. Come to find out they put the loan I just taken out three hours ago on a payment plan and my other loan was still due. So fast forward two weeks later and I‚Äôm in the store to pay back and re-loan and I‚Äôm told that I‚Äôm not eligible. I called customer care and was told I had to clear it up with a agency in Michigan. I called the agency up and they said they have no way of taking me off a payment plan and I need to call back to advance America. I was able to get on with a different customer care specialist and they were able to solve the problem. Unfortunately, this took me over an hour to get cleared up. So you might ask why after all these problems didn‚Äôt i file complaint before. I understand in these times businesses are having trouble running as efficiently as they would like. But you did send me an email asking for my feedback, so I‚Äôm providing it. I hope that not only for your business but for all the other businesses that are struggling things get better.",
