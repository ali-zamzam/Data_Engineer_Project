I simply paid a small fraction back to have access to it later as I usually do, but now I’m being told I have no access to anything I repaid early until I repay the entire amount. This has never been like this in all the years I’ve used it. Than it took me 30 minutes to get someone on the phone.…..2 weeks later. I recently left a review in which the company responded. This was due to the fact that in the middle of a pay period they would not let me pull out instacash after I repaid. They do have expensive withdrawal fees and use weird marketing tactics to get you to give more by tipping. Granted I only repaid the fraction, that fraction is generally available after repaying it. I do it often if I want to pay it off early and in baby steps . Two weeks later, we are two days out from my payday and %20 of my check always goes into this account. Suddenly today, the company is saying my bank did not release funds. Yes my check is pending or released in any other account",

Switched my direct deposit and all my financial activity to MoneyLion yet not eligible for credit builder plus, agents have no capability with anything besides stating to wait patiently for any concerns regarding my funds, agents do not communicate promptly through sms or email, I have received a $335 cash advance plus another $335 advance that totaled about $650 with fees and was paid on time when it was due. Now I am only eligible for half that amount, on payday. There goes all my hard earned money for repayment but not eligible for a similar amount as the previous advance. If I’m in good standing with an institution and never ever late with repayment along with direct deposit linked, how am I not eligible for a much more reasonable amount? I can go all night with how I’ve been unsatisfied and extremely upset with this institution. When my hold of $120 clears a month from now(unfortunately, that’s how long MoneyLion is taking to process such transaction, I will be considering closing my account and returning to my previous institution. At least there the agents are more helpful and punctual. All my crypto assets I had planned to move over to money lion along with my investments will be canceled immediately. I’ve never been so frustrated and unsatisfied with an institution that handles money and cryptocurrencies as I am now. Most problems do not get resolved and I’m tired being left unsure or confused at an institution that has my hard earned money being direct deposited into. I have a lot of thinking to do but if closing this account is what I have to do then I will proceed with it.",

Suddenly my instacash amount is $115!  I call cust svc and speak with Angel.  She tells me that its been reduced because a few repayments \"failed\".  I told her that was a mistake.  After asking her to look my account records she said she sees that I deposit daily and ALL MY PAYMENTS HAVE BEEN ON TIME OR EARLY!  She still can't tell me why my instacash was reduced.  After demanding to speak to a supervisor and being on hold for 40 minutes, a supervisor named Jack gets on the phone.  I let him know I love the instacash feature and have raved to my friends and family about MoneyLion.  In fact at least 7 friends have become MoneyLion customers.  After reviewing my account in a nutshell he tells me my limit was lowered because the higher limit was to \"entice\" me as a new customer and even though I DIRECT DEPOSIT OVER $100 EVERY DAY THE LIMIT WAS REDUCED TO $115 BECAUSE OF THEIR ALGORITHM!  I told him that is not stated anywhere.  He said that the enticement method is told to the customer at MoneyLion's discretion.  If I want a higher limit. I should make my direct deposits once a week or every other week.  THAT MAKES NO SENSE!!!!  MY DAILY DEPOSITS HAVE BEEN FINE TO GET THE HIGHER AMOUNT FOR THE LAST 6 MONTHS!  I let Jack know I was unhappy with this and it is not right that the company \"entices\" (his word, not mine) and then suddenly drops your borrowing power without disclosing this info upfront. I asked him how would he feel if he was the customer?  With that he ended the call and hung up on me!",

But then the app asked me to ID verify. I had no problem with this. I took the photo of my id. The app wouldn't accept the photo. I tried uploading five times to get the same result. After the money lion app wouldn't accept my id they disqualified me. I have spoken to first level customer service and they say there's nothing they can do. I asked for contact by a supervisor who can give me an explanation of the problem. They wouldn't do that either. I asked to close my account and to take my information out of their system since I can't use it. They won't do that either. So basically I have a useless app on my phone that I can't get rid of or use. No communication to understand the problem and possibly resolve it. All they left me with is a struggle. That money helped my family in between checks and it hurt us when it dried up for no reason. Frankly I'm angry about it and I want a resolution.

The ATM fees will eat you up if you don't use the recommended ones and it's kindof tricky to fund your account without a consistent direct deposit. I would also advise to keep your account open with your regular 'brick and mortar\" bank because they want you to link your outside account with them in order to do certain tasks that are necessary. The best part is the \"Insta-cash\" loans that you are offered with no interest. You can receive up to $250 in your account, instantly, at any time. I really do Love this Bank!",

There was an issue with my instacash eligibility amount. Somehow it had gotten switched to my Roar Money account instead of using my external account. Well the income difference substantial. I contacted a customer care agent and was told that he switched it back to my external account and that the insta cash eligibility amount would be corrected back to its normal amount within two business days that was July 6th well here it is August 3rd and it still has not been corrected I get a different story from every customer care agent. I was told this was escalated to their dedicated team whoever that may be more than a dozen times. I have over 24 hours of real time invested in explaining this problem and why there's a difference in the amount and the math that they keep trying to use on me. I've received 20% of my income on external account for over a year. Because of the perks of several of the different products that I use with them. At this point I give up this thing is nearly costing me my apartment as I was given this information so when moving I failed to make other arrangements to pay a electric deposit. Because I figured that the person on the line working for my financial institution knew what he was talking about. but this happened more more than one occasion with more than one agent as I said before I went through this with several different customer care agents and they were all on different page giving me different time frames and different hope to know about. I apologize for the long windedness of this review but as apparently speaking directly to a customer care agents and having an issue accelerated or escalated or prioritized whatever fails to do anything apparently. Except receive emails where they try to break down the math of why my amount is what it is based off the wrong account which was the issue in the first place. Why am I receiving which quite frankly is ignorant emails saying that basically the problem is the solution? Was thinking about moving all of my income into my Roar money account but if they cannot coordinate any better than what I have seen this month I'm a little worried about doing so. I hope this is rectified and they come back to the standard that I received for the first year and a half of doing business with them. This past month has been nothing but what I have felt like are lies and blow off tactics.",

I called and inquired on my 250 once I received notifications about being eligible when talking with a representative barely speaking good English he was very smug and proceeded to tell me they were providing more than enough, which realistically is a lie I get paid weekly and would have been qualified for 250 very dissatisfied with his response very bad customer service at the end of the day this isn’t the only application willing to give people money , let alone don’t act like y’all are doing folks a favor that’s what my bank is for if I ever needed a huge favor, I don’t recommend this app.Update 08/10/2022Upon placing my complaint on Trust Pilot the company has retaliated by unlinking my account taking the payout down to 25 when I had been approved for 175 when reaching out to a rep I informed them of an email I received about linking an account I also provided receipts that my account was already linked as I used their app a few times already with no issues up until I raised concerns , the company is discriminatory and will retaliate when they are in the wrong I do not recommend this app try other apps such as Dave. I have enough receipts to report their behavior to the bbb !08/16/2022By far the crappiest company I’ve dealt with they went in an authorized a charge with out my consent to my bank I called and they would not refund the transaction as my bank had me call them back to see if they would reverse the pending charge as it has not posted they have caused me to be charged a fee with my bank due to their incompetence I was not made aware or provided a notice that they would take money from an account that had zero in it we all knows what happens there okay, they wouldn’t know that because of their lack of communication, I talked with two managers and was under the impression I would be refunded and the entire amount would come out on the 26th with the first guy & that wasn’t the case when I called back the second time , this company is a complete rip off that preys on minorities that speak out against their unjust and discriminatory actions then proceeded to show me a document that doesn’t explain anything about the amount they would take, & the time frame they would auto debit an account if it was not payed on time I plan to file a lawsuit against their actions. Avoid this app by any means necessary I wouldn’t wish my experience on an enemy , payday loans any sort of loan would be better than money lion they charge you tips and transfer fees if you opt to not leave a tip they will add whatever amount they want into what you owe, while making sure you do more than one withdrawals to redeem your full amount as you can only do increments of 100. Waste more money trying to borrow and pay back then a standard payday or bank loan, I hope they are shut down in the future and can not cause financial harm to anyone else.",

You can send to your bank fee free, but that takes at least 2/3 business days. You should be able to withdraw the amount of your loan.

I recently got a credit builder loan, and this pay cycle, I paid my instacash loan off early. The app said I was again eligible for instacash, but when requested I got an error. When I asked the support chat why, it told me it was due to a “late credit builder loan payment” which is not due for another 2.5 weeks. I called their support line, who told me that even though the chat provided me an explanation in writing, the reasoning as well as the app stating that I am eligible for $355 in instacash — was not only incorrect, but they could not provide me with a reason that I was no longer eligible at all. I also had 13 fraudulent charges made on my Moneylion virtual card. So not only did an entire paycheck get taken in less than 24 hours due to fraud charges, but the ability to access instacash to have any money to use was also revoked, with support giving me ZERO information, and zero help. Do not use this app. It may seem great, I thought it was too for a while. But being a loyal and on time paying customer gets you absolutely nothing and support does not care about you or your money at all! Not only am I out an entire paycheck, but I also have zero support or even answers from the company that is supposed to be guarding my money. Stay away from these guys.",

What they don't tell you is that Instacash takes as long as three months to receive. I kept the account opened and changed my direct deposit back to my original bank. I then stopped using the account. Approximately six months ago I attempted to link my bank account to MoneyLion and it worked. I was authorized a decent amount. I decided I would send my Social Security retirement to my MoneyLion account for one reason only. They advertise that government payments are received as much as four days early. I am familiar with this type of early direct deposit because my current bank also does that with my Veterans Benefits. They state as soon as they receive notification from the US Treasury Department funds are disbursed. I did research and read everything I could to ensure this would apply to my SSA payment. I should have received early direct deposit today from my MoneyLion account. Nothing!! I then contacted them and was told they had received notification and they would disburse the funds Monday. The representative stated specifically, two days early. I informed her what their advertising stated in regards to government payments and at that time was informed that could take three months to adjust. I feel they misrepresented the timeline completely. I was counting on those funds. It has put me in a dire situation. This is basically a large company attempting to portray themselves as helping. When in reality they ask for tips as much or more than payday loan companies require. As soon as my deposit hits I am closing that account and refuse to deal with blatant deception.",

It’s pretty simple and easy to use.I don’t like that they kinda guilt trip you into giving them a $10+ tip when borrowing. Of course, it’s lower depending on what you borrow, but it’s still a lot for someone borrowing money due to financial troubles. The instant transfer fee is $5.99 and they ask that you tip because it’s interest free. If I borrow $100, tip the recommended $10, and pay the same company $5.99 for an instant tranfer(if I’m borrowing from you, it’s most likely because I need the money asap) , I’m paying 16% interest. You will be asked for the tip before the transaction and again when you try to borrow more money. I do enjoy this app and the money is there when you need it. I’m sure there a bunch of answers to my complaints, but in the end they will loan you the money(extremely dependable if your payment history is good), charge you $2.50 more for a transfer than at an atm, and then send you a sad picture of a worker who didn’t get their tip, twice.",

It will go into your Roar money wallet instantly, but there's nothing you can do with it from there. I needed money immediately for an emergency medical issue. I thought that the Instant Cash would be instantaneously like they say. You have to pay a fee to get it instantly. I paid 799 the first time. I paid 599 the second time. I don't remember what I paid the third time. The reason I kept requesting additional money, is because for three days I was on the phone, or is it a chat with customer service or a bot.. customer service repeatedly told me that I could get the cash instantly if I went through a third-party app such as PayPal, cash out, or venmo. Moneylion would not linked to any of those and it would not send cash to those apps. They had me spend extra money to get it super fast just so that I would never receive it. I still haven't received it. It takes 3 to 5 days to get into my bank, and that's the only place it will allow me to transfer the money to. I have to pay all these extra fees on top of the amount that they won't cancel. I asked them to cancel all transactions Since I no longer need their money oh, and they say that's impossible. I don't think it's impossible, but nevertheless they won't do it. Nobody knows where the money is that I paid to have immediately. The virtual debit card doesn't work for anything. I don't know why they have it. They say online that you can go to a Allpoint ATM and use it to withdraw cash. That is not true. There is no way that you can do it. I downloaded all these third-party apps, in an effort to link them to moneylion, and moneylion would not linked to them. It did linked to PayPal but it wouldn't send money to PayPal. It wouldn't send money to my debit card because the error message said there was a security problem. It was absolutely no way to get cash immediately and I feel that very deceiving did they write that and their description online over and over again. They also say no fees. Yes there is a fee to get instant cash that you can't get your hands on. The contact list ATMs that they have so many of don't work with the moneylion virtual card. That virtual card is useless. I think it's atrocious that they gave me the wrong information repeatedly and I have to pay for wrong information. It's a rip-off. Don't do it. Don't download the app. I asked them to cancel these transactions that still have not made it to my bank and they won't. I asked them to take back their money that is in their money lion wallet and they won't. They just want me to pay the extra fees. Plus transfer fees. I'm so sorry I ever got involved with this app",

I recently opened a money lion card as my options for brick and mortar banks at the moment are limited for reasons I don’t care to get into. That being said I solely rely on money lion for my banking and everyday purchases such as paying bills, buying my daughter food clothing the daily essentials etc etc. Since opening the account for the better half of about 2 weeks, I’ve had over 3 thousand dollars deposited into my money lion account via cash out from PayPal. Never once had an issue. Made purchases daily and even made major purchases with the account including my rent which is around 1400 dollars give or take. Again never having issues with any of that stuff that is until early yesterday afternoon where I received an email stating my account had been locked due to fraudulent activity. Never was a fraudulent charge on my account and if that was the case, I would have most certainly contacted money lion or meta bank on that matter. To cut to the chase, I basically got that issue resolved after hours of aggravating phone calls to foreign representatives who clearly show no sympathy or understanding of how hindering these situations can be. This morning I was unfortunately met with the same issue as the day before except this time my account was apparently closed with 508 dollars still on my account. Tried numerous times to call money lion and nobody is any help. Surprise surprise right? Anyway, upon calling multiple numbers trying to get a hold of someone who could explain to me at the very least on what’s going on I was met with generic pre scripted answers that had little to nothing to do with my specific situation. I did nothing other than use my money lion card and account for your everyday needs, even read the terms of service to make sure I didn’t step out if line and after reading it 3 times over I knew I had done nothing wrong and it was money lion scamming me for 508 dollars. It’s beyond me how a company closes your account and doesn’t let you withdraw funds. Literally the only source of money I had was on here and now I’m in a frenzy trying to situate a mess I didn’t create. If anyone out there has a resolution to this please let me know because I feel so helpless at the moment. I’m looking into hiring an attorney just because I don’t see anywhere else to turn.",

It does appear it will go into escheatment depending on the state which can take 3-5 years.Your account had been closed in accordance with our membership agreement. Unfortunately, that is all the information we have at this time. If you have further questions, you may refer back to your membership agreement.Best Regards,*****MoneyLion Customer AdvocateMoneyLion Customer care is a joke. They can't help and have pre arranged answers. God forbid if I was relying on my money they have to live and survive on....  BEWARE of the LION.,... Don't trust these people. Ranks of pure SCAM with their unethical practices.I asked one question from money lion. Why can't you return my money???? I did not abandon my account per laws of escheatment. Why can't they answer my question??  They have my bank information. They know who the originator is. Yet, they ask that I remove personal information from this review. I don't have anything to hide. They do....no transparency. No answers...I'm not someone who judges but what they do is  wrong. A legitimate banking institution will not deliberately try to keep your money from you. Do not put your money in money lion unless you can afford to lose it. My experience is real and not biased. I actually liked money lion until they screwed me over and now I know they can't be trusted. I have yet been able to speak with someone from money lion who can answer my questions.  Banks are supposed to be trusted with our money. BEWARE of the roaring lion, they will devour your assets...",

They gave me a reason that was how there system works so my deposit is with the and they will hold it until 2 days prior to the 3rd no matter what holiday or weekend. MONEYLION FIRST LIE AND DOWNALL HOLDING PEOPLE MONEY 2DAYS LONGER THAN all other early pay deposits banks with no real concrete reasons to offer  They lie by saying the don't hold your money and post as soon as received. You are put on shame wall for this big lie false advertising 😒.  Now they do have other great tools associated with the lion and so far those get A+ from me.",

I won’t keep any money with themA little money that you get back on transactions is a nice touch though. But you can do that with Stash as well and get actual stock back Not for everybody.

However, they get you by asking you to “tip” and then you can only get money in $100 or less increments and they make you pay $4.99 transfer fee for instant transfer which, let’s be real here, if you need a loan of $300 you immediately need it. Not in 3-5 business days. So if you need $300 you have to do 3 transactions which means, 3 tips and 3 transfer fees. I feel like this is very predatory of them to do.ETA after they replied I went and looked. It’s not 3-5 business days. My bad, it’s 2-5 business days. I also went to test the whole “don’t have to tip” statement with a $5 loan and while it is true, after you say “no tip” a screen pops up that says “are you sure? It’s how we stay interest free. We recommend a $3 tip” so they guilt you into “tipping” them.",

MoneyLion... they are for the underprivileged, the 99% of us who work our tails off and get swindled by the pretentious and uppity bank cats in corporate suits, all the while, we bail out their \"mistakes\" with the coffers our tax portions constantly fill every year, without fail. Predictably, they keep asking for more. MoneyLion, to me, is a real human-being, sympathetic to our plight, with generous pockets, and has a plethora of information on savings, raising credit scores (with action, not just words). They have 1-on-1 consultations about the pitfalls of spending beyond our means and reducing the clutter in the lingo that the elitist use to keep us scratching our heads. I say this: MoneyLion WAS there when my hometown bank of nearly 23 years of banking wouldn't even consider me for a fast cash advance. That hit me the hardest, so I hit back by withdrawing my funds and investing in MoneyLion. You will not regret the service, the simplicity, and the sound of money in your wallets. What does that sound..sound like? CHA CHING !!!and AAAAAHHH!!!",

Matter of fact money lion is so good I had my direct deposit from my job going to a account they help me set up and was able to take a loan over 500$ the very same day .I have told everyone I know about them and I think it’s time I told yous as well .. so if you want to build credit, get a quick loan to pay off that pesky bill , or even open a account where your money starts to work for you get money lion it truly is the king of apps I think everyone should have it",

I did not have a card and I needed the money for a bill that did not take apple pay. Too bad because am not able to transfer money from this account to my chase. I have tried numerous amounts, numerous times and no luck. I ordered a debit card, it has been two weeks and I still have no idea where it is, I can pay back from my personal chase account but can hardly use the money I borrowed. Today I had tried to use my Moneylion digital card (connected to apple pay, I have used it before) it declined three times with plenty of the money in the account.

I took out 2 credit builder plus loans...and paid them off on time, never missed a payment...I used Instant cash all the time and NEVER missed a payback...I called the company one day to pay off my balance on my Credit Builder Plus loan and the very inexperienced agent accidentally put my account in collections...I was shocked, he kept me on hold for close to 30 minutes in a panic and never was able to fix it. That was over a month ago. I have called too many times to count and they said the same thing to me...\"we apologize...its being escalated to a specialized team..\" I have not gotten ANY follow up, no emails and the account is still in collections. Today I was notified by my Credit Bureau that my Credit Score dropped \"29\" points because money lion reported this as delinquent!! I still have no follow-up and no contact from them I called today and they said the exact same thing! I just want to cry right now.",

I'm on my second credit building loan without any late payments but my credit score actually went down not up.Then I was offered a promo which I made sure I did everything required on my end which is 1)be in good standing with all accounts and 2) deposit $50 into my investment account and get $50 insta cash. I made the deposit but never got the promo insta cash I talked to customer service who told me that they had forward the issue to support and that I would either receive a follow-up email with further questions or I would see the promotion of $50 in my instacash. I did receive an email from support that day and responded within 10 minutes providing them the requested information which was a screenshot of what promotion I was talking about. I never heard back from there I emailed them about 6 times with no response. Then I saw an email stating that I had to use my $50 InstaCash or it would expire I logged into the app(the website has never functioned enough to allow me to sign in) but but it said $0 into cash available. I emailed customer service three or four more times with no response. I then about 3 weeks later got an email from my direct depositor that my direct deposit have been returned from my financial institution. Then my insta cash repayment and credit building loan became in default then I received an email from customer service stating that I was not eligible for the promotion because my current accounts were in default and not in good standing as required I immediately wrote back stating that that's not the case that I wasn't good standing at the time of the promo. I didn't immediately contacted my direct depositor and they were able to reissue my direct deposit but it would take 3 to 4 days and I still have not heard back from moneylion concerning the promo.I had to deal with customer service several times about the website not functioning and I'm always given the same answer \"why don't you just use the app\" I would not suggest this financial tool as a means of budgeting saving money financial advice there's no savings account and the cost of insta cash keeps going up.",

Lo and behold the next time it popped up asking for a $6 tip, I declined it. Stopped working again. 🥴I guess this is just another greedy company now.

First, if you get approved for a 250 loan they will only allow you to cash out 100 at a time. The offers for delivery to your personal bank account holds a fee plus tip. Lets not forget about the interest for that hundred dollars you cash out. By the time you add all those fees the loan isn't worth it. I read a few complaints from the BBB about this company, and one of the advocates states that you don't have to tip and it won't effect you eligibility, but trying to cash it out matters so they lied about that, advocate also says that turbo for delivery is free and only takes a few hours for your money to arrive, well I went and tried to used this method, but it wasn't free, this service cost me 15 plus tips to have the money put direct deposit into my account, plus you add the interest which goes without saying, moneylion isn't honest and I also have screen shots to prove this, so once I pay this account off I will no longer deal with money lion",

I recieved an email that they were making changes to thier system, I was to get direct deposit that same week. I checked in the moring and the deposit was not in my account. I chatted with a customer service rep who was no halp at all. All the person would say was \"They do not detect a direct deposit to my account\". I checked with my employer, who put me in contact with their bank. I was told the deposit was transmitted and acknowledged by the recieving bank. I got back on chat with a service rep from Money Lion, was told the same thing, \"The do not detect a direct deposit to my account\". This went on all day with them, They told me some one would call me, this never happened. The direct deposit showed up after 4:00pm....Today, I tried to add my new bank to the wallet, the service to get a quick loan between paydays seemed like a good idea. Again, met with more problems... I added the account, it showed up in my wallet, but didn't show up on the roar money side. I again got on chat, they wanted me to give them my bank account number over text,  told them no, I had added it through the plaid system, then they wanted me to delete my app and check again. Seriously, they have the worse informed customer service I have ever used. I ended up canceling my account and service.",

        "reviews": "I'm leaving my feedback for a money lending app/Money Lion, that is user friendly for the most part. There are pros and cons, but if you need money to help you stay afloat until payday, this is the app for you! You are asked to give a \"tip\" for the lending services and charged a fee for instant same day transfer of money. It literally happens right away with this option. You can of course, do the option of 5 to 7 business days for no fee. If you decide that same day is a must, you could borrow up to 100.00 for 11.99. Your total amount of money to borrow could be much larger than the amount you're allowed to borrow at one time. You could be approved for up to $300 to borrow, but the app allows you to borrow $20.00 to $100 at a time. Giving a $4.00 \"tip\" and charging you a instacash fee of $7.99. Once ML is linked to your bank account, it can predetermine on your payday cycle that is reoccurring in history, when they could/can be repaid by you. It normally sets the repayment date for your next paycheck. If this doesn't work for you, you have the option of changing or moving this date around a little. It's never easy to borrow money, but it's a little easier when you are using an app that allows you to navigate what works best for you. Reminders and account information are on the app, it's not hard to use. The app can glitch sometimes and tell you that it's not connected to your bank account, but you can fix this easily. If you need money, give it a try...",

I understand thats how they make money, but it hounds you for a regardless if you want to add a single tip for more than a single transaction/request. Not very flexible with dates is another thing. Moving a payment two days or so out isn't very helpful for people that, say want to move it out a couple of weeks, should something come up.

Just FYI though: when requesting Instacash, you can only do so in increments UP TO $50 at a time so I personally had 3 Instacash withdraws & not knowing how it worked, have a $5 tip with each request I took out & although the tip isn’t paid out then, at the end I paid out an extra $15 BUT THIS IS A FREE SERVICE so I do always try to tip a little something. Just a thought to the developers: Why not give the option for a custom tip amount because sometimes literally the lowest tip amount it will show all my screen is like five dollars and that may not be a lot to you folks who made this app, but for myself: a single mom to a wonderful, but also disabled child & who- especially right here at the holidays - is balling on a budget, a custom option for tipping I feel would help to generate more money being tipped.

I’m just tired of the headache. Another issue is that you have to fill out an actual form if there has been theft on your account. I had an ATM not dispense $60 I needed and I called customer and they told me to send the form and it would take 2-3 weeks for them to review and possibly give a credit but nothing that could be done in real time.

The amount of money they will loan to you can only be requested in arbitrary increments. Example: when I have $300 available to borrow, I have to make 3 request in rapid succession because I’m only allowed to ask for $100 at a time (even though I can borrow $300 at a time [confusing right!] and There’s a percentage based fee on the transaction itself if you want it to happen instantly (which is almost always), so when I need $300 I will be charged $30 on top of the $300 in transaction fees; The app is very pushy with asking for a tips during the transaction and upon using the feature again later, it will remind you that you didn’t tip last time and ask for the tip AGAIN for that transaction before proceeding to the new request. Also when I stopped tipping regularly,  they changed my requestable amount to lower amounts, so that I had to make more request to get the same amount of money (therefore netting more fees for the same amount of money) they also jumbled up the request amounts in attempts to throw you off so you can accidentally select the wrong amount and (you guessed it) need to make even more request for more fee. If you fall for their design you will be paying ~25% interest on these transaction…..that being said borrow carefully and read all the prompts. It has been a helpful tool since I figure out their traps, but honestly dangerous if you don’t catch it at first",

I found out that my account hacked by someone in Houston TX by calling the stores that my account had been hacked based on my bank statement. Anyway, once I got home to try to get an Uber home my account was declined. This happened in a span of less then 24 hours and when I reported it to Moneylion and gave them the details they absolutely refused to insure my money and place it back into my account. Its December and Ive been fighting to get my funds placed back into my account since the 24th of July. Long story short, from my experience Moneylion does NOT insure your money even though they claim to be covered by the FCC, which will be next phone call. Again your money is not insured with this institution and you will have to  QUALIFY to get your money back and beleive you me, they have zero intention on making sure your money is safe or returning it back to you if there is fraudulent activity on your account. YOU may as well be the suspect as far as they are concerned. Please DO NOT put your money or trust your finances with Moneylion. Its one of those places where its all good until it isnt good. And when its bad, its BAD! Ive had issues catching up on bills ever since and again, STILL fighting for basically my whole paycheck. You wont receive any help filing so good luck with that. They may call back but it will look like a spam call, and good luck getting hold of someone that takes your money and your account seriously unless you need to pay them. I cant give up because I cant afford to but I pray this review is taken very seriously to whom ever views it and please please please protect your money. Its too hard to earn to leave it in an unreliable intitution such as Moneylion. As for Moneylion please dont respond to this review, just work on getting my money back to my account because nothing you can say in response to this post to undo the negative effect that your lack of ethics has imposed on my family. I only ask for my funds and to peacefully part ways. Anything outside of that will be received as disingenuous at best.",

The loan amount did not come immediately. 2 days later, when the loan amount still had not been deposited, I called customer service. I was told by the first person it was a latency problem and not to worry because people were already working on fixing it, but she had no clue how long it would be. I asked to talk to a supervisor. He told me it was not a latency problem. He submitted an escalation supposedly for the correct department to initiate the deposit right away and it would be done within the next 24 hours and that someone would email me by the end of the day to confirm. I got no email that day. And it’s been 3 days since that call, and I still don’t have my loan. If it wasn’t the weekend, I’d have called back by now though I do y expect anyone to actually know what’s going on or help in any way.",

There is also the credit builder loan that I have taken advantage of multiple times and the biweekly payments are small and manageable. There is also the cash advance program which has also been very helpful and I have taken advantage of it frequently. My only complaint is that I have had a direct deposit from day 1 and yet it tells me that it is not detected. Which in turn changes my cash advance amount available. Other than that it is very beneficial and helpful. I get my credit score right on screen and I can see where my money goes and get paid two days earlier than regular checking/savings accounts. I recommend you to many others who have the same circumstances and situations that I have because I know it will help. Thank you Money Lion! Christina LevensonWyoming 😊",

They use Plaid, so you can easily integrate your accounts from other banks, they have very good customer support, even on Sundays!  Some services cost a lottle bit but they give you ways to earn that back just by using your MoneyLion debit card!  The App is also actually really useful, and easy to navigate.  MoneyLion is a real competitor to ANY 'BIG BANK' brand, and I can say, beats most.  Honestly, im seriously impressed.  This has been MY experience.  You definately should check them out! -RYAN",

The only true complaint I can see is within the retentions department. Having to resend the same documents already sent and repeating steps already requested is especially burdensome and costly to the client if its not resolved within a short window. I myself suffered late fees totaling around $125 and a small high interest loan just to put food on my table for my son's.  But with there being a holiday it wouldn't be fair to say it's always this way. Room for improvement. The apps start up is cumbersum and crowded. Those using older model phone's will find it crashing a lot before being able to access their information.  Report bugs, such as the apps refusal to acknowledge my need for a new card due to its own malfunction should be clearly visible so they can be sent by the user and addresses asap. Those receiving direct deposits due to benefits or social security should be recognized and not bombarded with continued adds requesting they start one theyve already established. Warnings about policy issues should be given before any attempts be made to lock a customer from their funds instead of surprising the customer and denying them access.

I can invest in crypto, I can invest in the stock market, I can choose where my spare change goes when I want to safe or something. I love the Insta cash. The credit builder is absolutely my favorite though. I was with you for a month and I got approved for a credit card which I’ve never been able to do my whole life.

Moneylions banking website is useless. You cannot access transactions or bank statements from their website. The only way you can do banking is via the App. You can only use the app to view your transactions or bank statements. The website is useless. How can you call it online banking if you are not able to review your transactions online. 2. The fraudulent transactions need to post for the bank to take action, however in my experience these transactions are in process status for ever with all of my balance deducted / hold because of this fraud. I contacted the bank for help since it's been like a month and my money is stuck the bank is asking me to contact these merchants and ask them to send Money Lion an email to remove the hold3. Customer Service Sucks, they don't know their how their own products or services work.I'm waiting for this issue to be resolved so I can go back to my other Major banks such as Bank of America who's first action on fraud is to give you your refund and then investigate, however Moneylion s policies look different, you got to print and sign a form and send it back with in 10 days, you don't hear back from them, then they say they didn't get the form. trust me it's been a night mare I have also sent several emails Requested to speak to someone in the corporate office. Requested for a call back from someone in the US but to no avail.I hope I get back my money that were fraudulent transactions. I'm gonna say good bye to these folks once I do that",

Once I decided to use it I was only able to borrow $50 at a time. Then to get it you either have to send it to RoarMoney which is free but then you have to pay to get it to your bank unless you want to wait a few days. If you skip RoarMoney and want it to go directly to your bank there is a fee, or your debit card a fee. However you get your money, unless you have changed your banking to Money Lion and you have direct deposit set up and a debit card with them, they charge outrageous fees to get your money. And since you can only get so much at a time, you pay the fees each time. It adds up. I have been with my bank for 20 years and I am not going to change it to bank with a mobile app. It is a good service if you do not mind all the fees.",

Then there's the InstaCash advance which is pretty great too. The good part about is it sets a limit on the amount you can get base on income AND SPENDING HABITS, this way they know you able to safely repay it. Also if you can wait 2 days there is no fee (but they do ask for a tip). If you do need it instant then there's s flat $5.99 fee not too high but still a little.

I was my account would be open in 1-2 business days after sending in verification information.  Ive heard no updates.  Their retention team is not responsive and you will be left vulnerable. Their direct deposit does not enable you to get your check 2 days early. That’s a lie and it’s never happened. Please save yourself and do not use their direct deposit and do not use this as your main debit card. You could get stuck like me.

Apparently, my transactions and deposits are not being reported accurately from my bank, through Plaid, to MoneyLion. Plaid has no timeline on the resolution with Varo; MoneyLion does not offer a viable alternative, even though I have been a customer for almost 2 years, and they should retain some history of my transactions.All this being said, my Instacash amount varies wildly from $250 to ineligible.

It doesn’t make sense that you only get the $250 and pay it back, along with the interest, membership fees for both apps, and tips…at least 4 different fees! That’s super excessive. I understand the tips and maybe 1 fee for membership. Then when I cancelled the credit builder plus app, I’m still getting charged the membership fees for both apps :( I cancelled credit builder plus Bc it completely defeats the purpose. I’m want to build my credit, SAVE money, and it’s nice to have the convenience of borrowing smaller amounts and paying back. It does NOT make sense to receive the $250 (credit builder) and once paid, you can’t get anything else until you pay $600 up front?!?!?! If I could do that, I wouldn’t need this app. So that’s why I cancelled that portion, and to top it off it was incredibly difficult to cancel. I had to call and be on hold 5 different times even though I had already paid back the $250 and all interest fees and was willing to pay whatever extra I needed too (which also was ridiculous but whatever)… I was willing to do just about anything to just cancel it. Honestly, Bc of that experience I would not feel comfortable opening a banking account with MoneyLion. I’m still getting charged double membership fees and was told that it will not be taken away. The only thing keeping me with MoneyLion is Instacash. It’s truly a lifesaver for me right now. I wish I had never even tried credit builder. Hopefully you guys can find a way to make some improvements to the app.",

I like their credit builder loan product, and I like how easy they make it to buy crypto.But everything about their edges is just rough. When something doesn't go right, nothing is ever resolved. Example:I want to start a new Moneylion Credit Builder Plus loan.The app glitched out, and when I get to the final screen? When I click continue? Error Message.I have talked to support 4 different times now with 4 different proposed solutions. Two of the solutions involved follow-up from them in some way - once they offered to send me DocuSign emails to finish everything that way, and the last times they said engineering would be reaching out. Neither actually happened. Unforced errors. Stupid.On top of that annoyance, the product changed. Now instead of a $500 microloan, it's $400 to the client with $100 kept in reserve. So now, not only can I not get a new little installment loan to keep in good standing on my credit report, I'm getting less cash whenever they do actually fix the problem. Stupid.Pairing my new bank account never worked. I haven't used Regions as my primary bank for over a year, but I can't pair my new main account with them because... Reasons. Stupid.They have had a few products \"coming soon\" for as long as I can remember. Credit cards? Forget it. Theyve been \"coming soon\" for 3+ years. Stupid. Larger loan amounts directly through them? \"Coming soon\", again, for years. Stupid.  They're great when stuff works but if something is broken don't expect them to fix it. Expect to waste your time pursuing a resolution that never comes.Edit: this response is a perfect encapsulation of all the complaints I've had thus far. I signed up to money lion using a personal email address that I have had for going on 20 years. The same email address was used to register for trustpilot, in fact it is the email address that alerted me to their reply.

Twice instacash has been given and then taken away. The first time 250 $just showed up  after my regular amount was allotted  . IDidn’t request it non the less I really appreciated the help  . Within 2 hrs the money disappeared with my explanation. I ask what happened. I got some  standard answer and a rude customer service member with a smart attitude. The second time was this month. I repaired my I instacash a few days early and I received my limit . The next day 200$ disappeared  . The customer service person said my deposits which have not changed at all didn’t match. He gave me the amounts of the deposits they were unchanged , however the wording for my state treasury deposit didn’t match and SS deposits all said SS for the last 3 months and beyond. ML computer system is flawed and needs help to read. I ask for a supervisor to explain. Non was available. Waiting on a call back. Of happening to me others are also dealing with this issue. I suggest ML  fix the issue asap and stop causing hardship to people already experiencing hardship.

They told me they had to wait for it to go through and then they cld fix it. Well once it went through my only option was to dispute it and they told me it will take 10 days to review and see if I “qualify” for a credit into my account. So basically someone stole all my money and now I’m having to wait 2-3 weeks to get it back. This all happened the same day I got a call from their fraud system and reported unauthorized transactions. They still let $1,100 in charges go through my account after that. They have no fraud prevention and cld care less ab ppl that are victims of fraud. I’ve been in banking 14 years and never had anything like this happen worst experience ever I will be closing my account once I’m returned my moneySo you just replied with the same lines I’ve been told for over a week now. I requested a copy of your fraud prevention policy and was never provided it. I wld like to know how and why you wld let $1,100 in charges be made right after I reported unauthorized activity to your fraud system. Why have me confirm that someone is trying to use my card and then allow them to drain my account? How does this happen? Do you just not care? Why even notify you of fraudulent activity if you allow it anyways?",

I know you have to pay 29.99$ a month in order to be able to get the \"1000$\" loan, but what are the other requirements? They only give half of whatever amount they approve you for, and hold the rest til it's paid off, correct? How do you know how much you qualify for and do they have payment plans to pay it back ? Or do they just automatically take all your money every time they can until it is paid off?",

Customer service I tried to deal with 2x because they have a section that gives you your credit score- I have no idea where they get that info because none of that info is even relatively similar to me. They are tempted to tell me that they received the info from my bank that’s connected w the app and either neither again understood what I was complaining about or they had no idea what they were talking about. In fact on a graph of my credit score the most recent supposed info was in 2019. So I’m never approved for the credit builder loan which 14.99 a month is plus monthly payments interest - that’s wild. Chime has free credit builder that really elevated my score. There are plenty on internet “banks” that have a credit builder card and it costs nothing. You deposit your money into that account, buy stuff, and the money comes out but as credit not debit . But whatever money you put in is how much you have to spend and the money spent comes from the money u deposited. Exactly like a debit card except it’s a visa must be ran as credit and THEY ACTUALLY DO REPORT TO THE CREDIT Bureaus unlike what was being blasted all over social media and news outlets. I saw it today on my Experian report “exceptional payment history,” and I stopped using chime before the news broke that lie.But the credit score deal and the fact that they are using that fake info to deny me for their credit builder card is my only negative- no one & nothing is 100% on point perfect. Impossible. So yes, I think they still rock. The genius (paid part) is great. Lots of tools and advice. But I couldn’t afford it. To those who can it could be a really huge help!",

On 10/21 I looked on account and saw that it was in some investment account with moneyloin. I immediately called customer service and was quickly given excuses as to why my funds could not be refunded immediately. I had taken out a loan but paid it back and I had another pending transaction that was not due until next paycheck. I was told by the representative that I would have to pay additional money to pay off the loan that was not due until next pay date. I explained to her that it could be taken out of the $200 that was in the account if that was the hold up. I then questioned how my money got into this investment account that I never set up never put money into and never authorized. She told me the account was set when I opened checking. With this company I only asked for checking. I proceeded to ask to speak to a manager. I am placed on hold long enough for them to talk and I get a call come through it’s the manager. He places me on hold to hang up with representative. Which immediately I found shaky. I mean I know it’s Covid but most big companies have switch boards. I spoke with him and while speaking with him we discovered low and behold this account I never set up had the same exact last for numbers as the external debit card I requested my funds to go to. He acknowledged he saw this but couldn’t do anything because it went to another company and that he would initiate a liquidation. I then said I didn’t want that and wanted refund. I requested the company that had my money contact. He then said sorry that’s all the information I have and pretty much told me they would have my mon for 5-7 business days but he would start process. Fast forward to 10/26. I kept checking the site and low and behold the withdrawal button that was grey was now lit up and I hit withdraw because I want my money. I then called and was told my withdrawal started 10/26 I then asked to speak to supervisor same thing got a call same guy. He tells me they started withdrawal 10/26 I then became angry and told him what he told me he then said I see you filed a complaint with BBB I said yes because you are withholding my funds and giving me the run around. He then became very dry and as before said I would have to wait. I later went on website and was able to see where they were at which was the beginning. Now today I can’t see anything and I still do not have my money. They have put me in a major struggle with this and as soon as my funds are returned I’m closing this account and never coming back!",

Even the person responding to their reviews on here doesn't have the slightest idea of what is going on or what to do about it. I changed to the RoarMoney account because they said I would get paid 2 days early. I've been using Varo which does the same thing and would normally get my check today the 26th. I waited all day for my money and finally called to be told no I won't get it early it will be released on the 1st even though they have received it. When I complained they then say I will get it on the 30th which is Saturday. That's no earlier then a regular bank. All Monday deposits show up on Saturday morning. They lied about giving you it early. I will definitely be going back to my old bank varo.

If you do not have good credit they do help build credit with the whole loan program, the only problem I have is that literally once you calculate up all the fees that they charge you every month for that loan you've paid $120 in membership fees for a year and I'd say about an extra 40 bucks for interest & for me I rather just use a credit card. My interest wasn't that high though because I made sure to pay more every time I made a payment to bring my interest rate down but even the instacash, I feel bad because they ask you to leave a tip but dang by the time you take out the little money they charge you $5 to put it on your own debit card if you put it on their debit card you still have to pay a $3 fee at an ATM plus a dollar fee to them for using an outside ATM which totals up to $4, shoot you might as well slap on the extra buck and put it on your own debit card. Once it's time to pay them back I've already hit $15 in fees so to me that's their tip right tthere They only allow you to take out $50 at a time and every single time you take out money instantly you must pay the fee for it so if someone is hurting bad and they need to hit insta-cash up for 300 bucks you are looking at $30 dollars in payback fees. THEY DO GIVE YOU A FREE OPTION WHICH TAKES ABOUT 2 TO 3 DAYS TO TRANSFER TO YOUR BANK SO IF YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT YOU WILL BE STRUGGLING FOR THE WEEK YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND DO THAT AHEAD OF TIME. I guess I appreciate the app overall which is why I'm giving them this review because they have helped me out in moments where I didn't know what I was going to do.",

They also keep telling me \"my supervisor will call you within the hour.\" And they never call you back.... Moneylion statements say that if an investigation into fraudulent charges takes longer than 10 days they will credit your account the amount you believe is due back to you so you don't have to go with it, but they will NOT do this!

        "reviews": "Very easy and helpful banking and fast cash \"instacash\" for those times of need and short on funding  only down side I'd honestly say is when you do the instacash their is a \"tip\" area for getting the funds you want or need. They start with an automatic $5 and goes as low as $2 but goes higher than $5. If you choose the no tip option they send quick message on screen kinda makes you feel bad but they have a $3.99 service charge to get it instantly even tho it's called instacash that means to me you get it right then not pay $3.99 so you can get it right now and also have to leave a tip.  They say it's not free and they are right they get $3.99 when you get it right then and then  tip. I don't want to sound un-greatful but if your getting that money the your probably already in need and having some issues financially so every dollar kept is better for individual.  I appreciate this app and money lion more than you'd guess by this review but it said be honest so that's exactly what I am doing. I have chosen no tip before and I already fee extremely horrible for asking for help and then reading that message just made me feel even worse but then I was able to get the house hold Items needed for our kids and family so I just sucked it up bitter cup.  One day hopefully I'll be able to get ahead enuf that I'm squared away and won't need to do instacash and will be able to purchase more crypto instead also brings to next awesome point you can do investing with the app as platform for another app/platform and moneylion is just facilitating the safe space to allow you to invest as you wish  amazing features I have my S.O. hooked up now finally and am waiting for rest of my peoples to set up and get hooked up. The more they do the more insensitive they provide for me as well  AIRBORNE ALL THE WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I am in the middle of building my credit and am having trouble being approved for a credit card since having to file for bankruptcy last year. I like that the they give you the option to tip for there services. It is the courtesy thing to do is tip and MoneyLion suggest the amount. But yet keep in mind we are asking for a loan. I don’t want to dig my pockets deeper then I already am. So I like that there is an option to where you can give a tip in they amount you can afford or budget I would have to say. I am very pleased with there services. Thank you 😊 very much for helping me in my time of need and hardship.",

It's a joke, this morning I had a chat rep by the name of Joan waste over an hour of my time telling me she was releasing my funds specifically mentioning the amount and then only to be told after 45 minutes of waiting around for her that she was looking at the wrong document.",

From a creditbuilder loan, to buying crypto, invest your money and just forget about it and they will do the rest for you, but if that isn't what you want to do you have the option to manage the investment account on your own! Cashback deals and many other resources build for everyone and it doesn't matter what type of situation you are in! They have quickly helped me any time i have had questions and reached out to customer service! The only reason I didnt give 5 stars is because I have withdrawn money once in my investment account and I still havent seen it arrive in my account yet... I talked to someone but they might have misunderstood what i was asking and told me it would be 7 to 10 days before i would see it arrive.... I started the withdrawl on September 30th and its now October 12th... My other investment account takes me the 3 waiting days and my money is accounted for in my banking account. So that may need some improvment.. or im just unlucky and some issues happend that are going to be resolved hopefully soon... Other than that one complaint I think they have a really great concept and hope they keep adding more features to help people out especially people when they are in a bad spot and need some extra money for emergency situations!",

They have said that my account was charged-out, but yet and still I have an active account with on time payments. They do not take responsibility of none of their faults, and believe me when I say they have plenty. They always find a way to tell the customer that it is their fault and never refund or fix your account to rectify the problem that they caused. I repeat, do not do business with this company. I will soon be finish with my loan and I will not have any more dealing with this company! Don’t deal with them!",

Now if you catch on to what they are doing and decide to pay the loan back. They will require you to pay $1000 dollars back and hold $700 of your money for 7 business days. This means they are holding money that you didn't even borrow. Do not get this loan. With that being said, I paid $48 out of pocket for a $300 loan for 2 weeks and in order to pay the $300 back I had to come up with $1000 and now they have been holding my funds for over a week.

But no this world is backwards the ppl who struggle pay more and get less so sad. Oh and asking for a tip when we already pay 4 dollars to get our Instacash instantly is ridiculous it's done by computer no human moves that fast and u say no fees no interest but limit it to 50 dollars so I have to pay 5 times and borrow 350 pay back over 400 makes no sense credit builder I have to pay a fee monthly for that hello I have bad credit I have no money I have to live on 750 dollars a mo a single mom with 3 kids  as u can see and u take and take and take but I need it so I continue to give but In my eyes your crooks like asking for a tip and when u say no u go to the next page and get one anyway bc I'm pushing buttons too fast stealing is what ur doing is this going to fix any of it probably not but unless u can afford this app I don't recommend it at all",

Although the tip option is \"optional\", each time you dont leave a tip the app essentially guilts you or it reminds you that you should tip. I feel like if you have the option to request a higher amount, your limit should be $100 each request. Not $50. I get the app is trying to make some money but having to tip each time is pretty wild.

        "reviews": "Tried to close my account in Sept 2021, and just as before, their customer service is lukewarm garbage, practically non-existent. It took me forever to get a rep on the phone, through a maze of IVR menus and long pre-recorded messages, which I finally navigated to speak to a human. The rep is clearly reading from scripts, and has left me sitting on hold for at least 20 minutes (while we only interacted for about 2 minutes). He never even bothered to ask me why I'm closing my account. I requested full deletion from their database (per my legal rights as a US consumer); the rep cannot tell me exactly what personal information they'll be holding onto, after my deletion request. He referred me to their site's Terms and Conditions, which also do not state exactly what pieces of my personal information they'll be holding onto. So now I'm hold for a supervisor; the rep tried to get me to \"wait for a call back from a supervisor within 24 hours\" but I said no, I'll hold, because I know better than to think I can count on this company to follow up. It's been 10 minutes on hold waiting for an available supervisor, to tell me exactly what personal information of mine they'll be keeping - because that is not listed in the website's terms and conditions. We're in the age of identity breaches folks, and this \"bank\" that's now publicly traded, and farms out their support calls overseas, can't even tell you exactly what of your personal information they'll be keeping after you *try* to close your account (SS#? DOB? The ingredients for *another* identity breach, through a bank that's impossible to get ahold of on the phone?). Their website won't even let you change your address, or phone number. Stay far, far, far, away. Find a local credit union, or set fire to your hard-earned cash, because that's better than being bitten by MoneyLion. MoneyLion is not a bank; they should never have been given a license to do banking business in the US. It's a scam, to steal your money, waste your time, and pad the pockets of stockholders, thanks to their recent IPO. I feel sorry for anyone who has ever given them a dime of their money, or a minute of their time.Sept 2021 Update: After 65 minutes on the phone with the first rep, a supervisor finally called me from another line. She said they will be reviewing their IVR menu, and their policies for when a customer calls to cancel their account. I still say, stay far away from this publicly traded bank, because they're clearly not spending that IPO money on more call center staffing. Otherwise it wouldn't have taken me almost 75 minutes to get an answer that any local bank teller could have given me in 75 seconds.Original review on Play store, from fall 2019: Tried FOR MONTHS to verify my account to get their loan. I've lived in the same state my whole 47 years of life, & the same county for 23 years. They take a business week to turn around email requests. If you manage to get someone on the phone, they read off scripts and give you stock, unhelpful answers. Loan terms are ridiculous: 1) pay $20/mo for Plus; 2) Get a $500 loan - oh wait, now that you've got the loan, btw you only get $125 now, then pay us $900 over 2 years, then you get your other $375. So I paid off the $500 ASAP, and they waited 2 weeks to release the $375.",

The last loan I paid off I tried to re borrow it because I'm having a family emergency and I keep getting denied. I call customer service over the phone and I chat them online and they all tell me that they can't verify my income through my account or that my account isn't linked when I've linked it myself numerous times before reaching out to customer service. I feel like I'm getting the runaround every person I've talked to has given me a different reason as to why I can't borrow this loan.

I’m in the market for a small business loan, and, trusting MoneyLion, I used the links listed in their “loans” section to choose providers. All but one was a link to a scam or spam, not actual lenders, but shady “middle man” type sites that ask for everything from your social to your bank account number, only to forward you to another “middle man” site. I went through the application process on one site only, that seemed ok, and I have been getting 20-30 spam emails since then. Apparently they sold my email address to advertisers. I am FURIOUS that MoneyLion would provide links to this type of thing. Obviously they can’t be trusted. So, as an alternative, I tried to apply for MoneyLion’s OWN loan program, the credit builder plus. My credit isn’t terrible, but could always be better. So why not? Because I can’t - why? BECAUSE I HAVE A MONEYLION ACCOUNT. I literally can not apply because my direct deposit and spending history is in a MoneyLion account, and they will only let you prove income banking history from an EXTERNAL bank. What in the world?? I called customer service to confirm this because it seemed absolutely insane, but was told point blank that I would need to open a new bank account, switch my direct deposit to that account, and then wait 60 days for the account to be considered “established” before I can apply for the loan. Something smells sketchy when they don’t trust their own accounts or their own members. So, off I go searching for a new account, AGAIN. The second star is because they used to be so awesome :(",

Strang , but , true...So yeah A huge thank you Moneylion for being there for those of us in our times of need, & , simply being there for us like you shown thus far. You actually mean a lot evwn more than you know !! But,You could possibly be the very reason that someone made it into work that week and are reasons of them still holding on to their job being able too keep food on their table and their utilities kept going.. So for the little extra money you lend , you could possibly have turned a life arround for themselves. Like i said for some of us without you we woukd have none other ootiins periode. Speaking for many i believe...",

I was transferring money to a relative that was in dire need. They did this for Security reasons. I understand that but what I don't understand is why they could not be like other Banks that send you a text or email and ask \"Did you make this transaction?\" instead of immediately suspending it. I had to fax them a copy of my Driver's License and a Billing Statement showing my proof of Address. I did this a few weeks ago. The first time I emailed it to them, I found out their Customer Service gave me the incorrect Email Address. The second time I emailed it to the correct Email Address was last Tuesday, 8/24 and until today 8/30 my account is still suspended and I can't even access my own paycheck that was directly deposited on Wed, 8/25, which is very unfair. I have bills to pay and I can't pay back my InstaCash due to this and MoneyLion is saying I am late. I would not have been late if they had not suspended my account for making a transfer on it. It was me and their process is ridiculous. I was a very pleased Customer until this happened. I can't buy food or groceries, I am starving right now. Thanks MoneyLion.",

I called when I said what happened a immediately and customer service said they would submit a ticket stating the accident and have it put back on to my regular payments and it would open up my instacash again. But  a week later when my deposit hit they took the full amount of what I owed for instacash which is fine but my instacash wasnt reopened cause they still hadnt fixed the problem the credit builder loan payments.  Meaning my family doesnt have the extra funds that may be required from time to time for no fault of my own. I called support again today and of course they said there was still no response about the ticket and that maybe I should call back next wenesday and they couldnt open my instacash again until they fixed the error. I have been with money lion for several years now and I have never missed any payments whether its membership fees instacash repayments or credit builder loan payments. I have a steady income deposited every two weeks. and even stuck it out when they apparently issued my account number to someone else also (this is exactly what the representative told me) and they stole over 700 everything my family had at places in India.) and it took money lion weeks to issue credit for the clearly stolen money. Ive stuck it out when customer representatives have been rude and hung up on me, and refused to help with issues. Ive always been greatly appreciative of the services offered by money lion. But their timing it takes to respond to support tickets that can greatly effect their customers ability to pay their bills and feed their children. Please fix this soon.

I just wish I could utilize the credit builder plus option but my bank isn't on the list. Please add chime to the list of banks?! It is an online bank and it operates through a bank which is on the list, but I still can't add my chime account.

Besides the bait and switch the fact customer service is impossible to get hold off is my biggest complaint. They lie and it's the simple truth. When you wait at least 2 hrs to speak with a person, by the way never do the call back feature it never happens, but when you reach a person they will say they are opening a case. They say they will be in touch when the area expert looks into the issue. Well sometimes 5 minutes later or 2 days later or two weeks later it's always the same. You get an email saying the case is closed. When you call And wait 2+ hrs again they tell you the case was closed because they weren't able to reach you for help on the issue. The funny thing is they can send a \"closed\" email about the case but you never receive a call or email about the actual problem. It's brutal and always a B's way to close a case they had zero intention to actually try and resolved. Just not the bank it once was, gain typical bait and switch.",

One thing they did which i DON'T LIKE is limit transfers to $50. So say i qualify for 200 instacash, now i can only get at it in $50 chunks. And if i want that $50 chunk instantly (of course i do), then i have to pay the associated fee. And if i want 100 at once, that'll be 2 separate transactions. Each with their own fee.",

They literally strip it back down to basics and believe that if you're generating an income of some sorts you should be entitled to a small-sizeable advance and that's on the basis of trust, honesty and hard work.  Those are morals you'll see across the board on the MoneyLion app as they have essentially become a better way of banking for \"the people\" and I just find that very reputable,  rather convenient and ultimately the type of financial institution I want to do future business with.  Strong Morals, Education,  one of a kind tools and resources all continue to assist in my interest and bond with the company an it sort of becomes a scenario after actively seeing the way MoneyLion interacts with their customer base where you're both finding one another united in these struggles together,  you're experiences of the good times are also joined side by side with them the whole way through, for better or worse and after all isn't that the way its suppose to truly be?",

There’s the credit builder loan which reports your payments to the credit bureaus thus helping your credit score improve.

The reason I give 4 and not 5 stars is because the features for paying your loan payments are limited and if you ever fall behind a payment, they don’t offer the option to make a partial payment which could be beneficial depending on a persons situation.

Also even tho I was being as civil as I could be one of their customer support agents just hung up on me! I'm beyond upset, I'm homeless and live in a women's shelter in Portland and I've been thru hell I don't need this! Moneylion you are crooks!.... ² So it just takes a bad review to get your attention? Why didn't you just say so? Ok, first of all victim shaming is not only SUPER classy but professional as well! And u now suggest I reach out thru your social media for help? You've GOT to be f**king joking right? Ok sure, which one of your Instagram accounts should I try, there's only 40 or 50 at least? Should I try messaging the one where \"moneylion\" claims I've won $2021 or should I try the one that called me a goat and said such vulgarity it should belong in a porn mag? I take responsibility for being naive and not thinking on this one but with as many fake profiles these ppl have made I know this can't be the first you've heard of this and there's got 2 b more victims.Also i DID reach out to both you & Instagram to get help with this but nothing! There's no such thing as REAL live support anymore! I had always paid back apps on time and was hoping to raise my credit score so that I could put a roof over my head and get my mom and I an apartment together but instead I've had to borrow again right after paying them all back just to pay all the motels I've had to stay bcuz I had nowhere 2 go and bcuz the shelters here in Portland are overloaded unless I wanted to pitch a tent out here downtown and there's just so many of the mentally ill homeless that no one cares about one more, there was just no help just like now, there's only greed and blaming and pretty much just \"oh well you're screwed lady hope u learned your lesson!\" I've been so stressed I lost my hair and am now super thin and was in fear of being less than a day away from the streets where it's more like an insane asylum for ppl who took too many drugs and now this bs? Yeah I was gullible and desperate but the links and messages looked pretty legit just like the real Moneylion so they did their homework,guess i shoulda just did mine or at least remembered to change my login info immediately but I didn't, so in a nutshell moneylion are you saying that I deserved this? Let me know and in the meantime I hope that $205 that you wrongfully took from me is doing more for you than it could've for me since I've been broke since before I even woke up on payday, without a damn cigarette to calm me down or unable to buy food when I work late and miss dinner at the women's shelter, no, not a bunch of made up bs this is %100 truth and idk how hard you have to work for your $ but I'm a housekeeper at a residential home for the disabled so what I do IS  hard work therefore I shouldn't have had to beg you for my own money back or my bank to hurry up with their \"provisional\" money that I still have yet to receive or for you to at least let me get an Instacash loan that someone else got to cash in on from MY loyalty and on time payments that I earned! It's almost like you're siding WITH the bad guys,except to me you're one of them also! And great customer service btw,speaking of your rep just hanging up on me for being angry yet in a civil manor demanding answers? And because I had to change my debit card,now all my other payday apps have encountered more bugs they need to fix,they all started me over even tho my accounts still the same and charging me  new member fees again so I was looking at a $10 advance from other apps I use like DAVE when used to be $100! God Bless the good ppl from Earnin, they're truly #1! They are always so quick 2 help and fix my issues, they raised my max rather than decrease it like Cleo, Dave and KLOVER who just snatched up the $10  i had borrowed and b4 I even got across street to buy lunch at work it was gone and wasn't even due till TOMORROW! trust them folks to ever get your payback date correct EVERYTIME, double check! Am I bitter? Yes, do I sound a little bit like someone who's snapped? Yup! U would too if you've been in my shoes not to mention that my bank Rivermark CCU who has done everything they can to assure they get at least 1 to 2 $30 overdraft fees outta me each pay period even when the apps have a different post date they push em on thru anyways so that they can charge me for it which in hence is making me look irresponsible and likely to keep me and mom homeless even longer so thanks for the HELP Moneylion,Instagram,Rivermark! You got my referrals! 👍_In Instagram Type moneylion in searchbar to 👀 and I got screenshots to prove it all if anyone's interested in helping me stop them!",

I gave only three stars due to the fact that the Insta cash feature is deceivingly expensive. Zero APR is true however the other fees associated set an actual APR over 500%.First time I used this feature cash was instantly deposited into my bank account for a fee And deposits are capped at $50 regardless of amount available to you I’m assuming to charge you an additional fee. Tips are not required but changing the default tip Will take a couple of attempts if you’re not paying attention you will pay an automatic high tip amount. The second time I used this feature after having set up a money roar account Money was deposited into that account not my bank making the instant part useless and a waste of money for the additional fees since it takes two days to transfer to your bank. To summarize great app highly recommend it is slightly expensive and does need some fine-tuning.",

I believed them the first time when they said it was a system glitch and took them up on the second offer. Nope! It happened like clockwork again when I paid off the loan. I have filed complaints with the federal government, CFPB, OCC, Texas Attorney General office as this a blatant violation of UDAAP. This has cost me thousands of dollars and housing approvals!

To use instant cash you can borrow in increments of $5- $50 until you reach the max they have for you. When you borrow you tip them “the amount you think is fair” with the automatic defaults tip is $5, but you can alter it to any amount including $0. However when you do select $0 you get to a screen that says you didn’t tip and it requests that you leave a tip. They provide you with a card to use for instant cash and adding direct deposits, but there’s a charge of $3.99 to have the instant cash funds transferred to that card (in addition to the tip). Example- borrow $50 + $5 default tip+ $3.99 transfer to the card they provide fee. Repayment amount = $58.99)You can also transfer the money to your personal debit card for $4.99. The transfer fees don’t exist if you transfer to you checking account but that takes a few business days to arrive and in an emergency you need funds quicker than that.",

It’s a great dashboard if you have multiple accounts and allows for easy and instant money transfers with low fees. Then on top of all the other perks you’ll find they also loan you a few hundred interest free. I always tip, a few bucks tip to borrow $250 - that’s pretty cool they do that. They have a credit builder program that works. Really works as I’m working toward a permanent solution to financial obstacles.

I scheduled a payment. Suddenly it’s brought to my attention that my June Auto Payment was still scheduled to come out on June 28th automatically and the June payment I scheduled to pay early on June 23rd is scheduled to come out the next day on June 29th. When I spoke to customer service they told me they couldn’t cancel a pending payment. After it cleared my account is listed as past due. I paid my June 28th payment. I don’t understand how I can be past due when my next payment was due July 28th. Customer Service tells me that I have no payments scheduled for July. They say I had a payment due June 28th and 29th. Which is ridiculous. I looked over my loan agreement which clearly states 1 payment a month on the 28th. I can not be late for a payment that is not due for another 23 days from today. My instacash has been paused due to a missed payment that I didn’t miss. My good standing has been destroyed because I made a payment early NOT LATE early. There is literally no bank, heck there’s no good company in the world that wouldn’t correct this mistake in a second. It’s easy to see I did try to pay my July payment before my June payment. Agents are telling me I never had a July payment scheduled so they can’t change it. Again, my loan agreement states 1 payment due monthly on the 28th of the month. This is criminal. I will be contacting the BBB and my attorney if it’s not corrected.",

It has plenty of excellent features, including tips on building your credit, third party loan offers, credit score checks, investment portfolios, and of course the great Instacash, and more.  But I’ve found them to not be consistent with how they work the due date or the amount of the loan on that. On July 2, for instance, I borrowed $50, and it didn’t even surprise me when the due date was July 2. I just rolled my eyes in my head thinking here we go again. It does no good to message them because they always have some technical reason for why it’s done what it did, and you gotta live with it, like it or not. However, I tried again later and it did what it’s supposed to do, due date next month when I get paid.  Last month it was so messed up I tried to get them to explain to me why the due date is due only a few days later instead of when I get paid on the first and I never did understand the person’s reasoning, I think they’re trained to talk so techie that you just have no room to argue and have to accept it. I did get them to move the due date to the 28th, since we get our check two days early.  Shouldn’t MoneyLion know they get my direct deposit two days early each month?  You’d think.  But my dd didn’t come in on the 28th and I thought it was rude of them to pull what payment they could out of Chime (I didn’t have the full amount in Chime at that time of the month). Them doing that caused a transaction from a lender to be declined from insufficient funds. I do feel that since MoneyLion knows exactly when they receive my monthly dd, they could’ve been more respectful and waited for it to arrive rather than take what money they could get out of my other bank, causing me stress. The bottom line though, MoneyLion has many helpful and excellent features for the consumer, and in my opinion, they need to work on consistency with the Instacash feature so as to prevent all the unnecessary stress for the consumer.",

I told the lady on the phone several times that that was NOT my phone number. So why, after I reported this was this phone number allowed to connect to another account?! How is that now flagged as suspicious activity?I have so many questions. After this person changed the phone number and then immediately after started making instacash withdrawals, why wasn’t that flagged as suspicious activity? And after they paid back the advances and then made MORE advances, why was that not flagged as suspicious activity? When they used all of the advanced funds to make two large purchases from a place in Hong Kong WHY WAS THAT NOT FLAGGED AS SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY? When they changed the phone number on my account, why didn’t I get an email? Why was there no two step authentication? I need answers. They took everything.",

Making me request $50 at a time makes it expensive.Reply from MoneyLionAn hour agoInstacash funding is FREE if you choose standard delivery, which takes only 24-48 hours. If you need your Instacash extra fast, you can choose instant Turbo funding for $4.99 (or $3.99 if you have our RoarMoney bank account). The Turbo fee is totally optional and just helps us cover the cost of delivering your cash advance instantly when you’re in a pinch. We appreciate your feedback, and if you have any other questions, please feel free to contact us directly.Instant Cash isn’t instant if you have to wait 2 business days.  It would be 2 business day cash.  The cast for instant payments through a debit card is .50 cents.  You charge $4.99.  I do enjoy the service. I would rate it 5 stars and recommend it to all of f my family and friends if I would choose how much I needed up to my instant cash limit.  I would be willing to tip every single time if the fee wasn’t already profitable for money lion.  You are close to having a great product.  All your doing now is limiting your growth and popularity while letting someone create a service to directly compete with you and make it theirs.  All cabs and ride shares are called Uber now.  All tissue is called Kleenex.  You could own the instant cash market.  Lyft did economy ride share first.  Uber came up with Uber x as a response.  Now it’s all referred to as ubering by the consumer.  Good luck city and thank you for helping me out.",

You have to pay a processing fee for every amount you withdraw, not to mention, MoneyLion claims tipping is optional but if you choose not to tip for an amount you withdraw, the next time you try to borrow money, a screen will pop up stating you didn’t leave a tip the last time and it forces you to tip the company before you’re able to withdraw more money. The company shouldn’t claim that tipping is optional when you really don’t have a choice. I pay about an additional $70-$80 every week due to processing fees and tips and that is absolutely ridiculous.In response to MoneyLion’s reply: Nobody wants to wait 2 days for standard delivery because nobody takes out a payday loan unless it is for an immediate emergency. And you are 1000% lying about optional tipping, there was no way for me to exit out of that prompt without leaving you all a tip (the prompt literally said, “Whoops, looks like you didn’t leave us a tip last time. Tipping allows us to continue to deliver your funds with 0%APR.” with a button at the bottom of the screen FORCING me to tip $3). I’ve already gone back and forth with one of your employees about this as well as how you give incorrect dates of when money will be deposited into your RoarMoney account (screenshots were provided for this). I use to work in the payday/installment loan industry and it’s behaviors like the ones your company displays that has made these loans illegal in my state.",

It also makes investing in the stock market super easy for Novices like me, starting with only $5. The only thing that possibly could make Moneylion any better in assisting someone financially, is if they incorporated a no fee overdraft option where they'd spot $25 or $50 via Roarmoney debit card for purchases only, not cash, when things might be a little tight those few days before payday - for those that have Direct Deposit into their Roarmoney account each month, which would automatically pay the overdraft amount back with option of tip. Otherwise I think Moneylion is pretty perfect. Thank you for everything so far Moneylion, I super appreciate it!  💛🦁💛",

Oh and dont het me started with their false advertisement of getting paid two days early what a joke. And the instacash you do not geyvup to 250$ just because of direct deposit thats a membership fee as well to get the 250$ although you have your direct deposit set up with them. If you have any irregualr deposits made to your account like a friend transferring you money that will make their incapable and unreliable system lose any type of deposit information its ever received from you and its like basically starting iver to recieve instacash again. Its an elementary bank with no customer service or even an IT department to help correct with the incorrect deposits the system lables them as. Ive had nothing but trouble with this bank and the getting paid two days early was only valid for the first two months i started banking with them ever since i have not gotten paid two days early and its been seven months now.

I called back a few days later and was told a dispute was never created.I’ve also tried checking into hotels on 2 separate occasions and had my card declined both times because the charge was more than ITV was supposed to be. On both occasions, MoneyLion representatives have told me it was the merchant holding the extra money. Each time the merchant showed me exactly what they were charging, and in one instance they even spoke with the MoneyLion representative themselves and were told the same thing.I finally filled a BBB complaint, and the response given by the business was that they do, in fact, hold an extra 20% on charges like hotels and restaurants. Had I been accurately informed the first time this happened I could have planned for it the second time around.This also happened once in a drivethru when I was paying for food, and I had no idea why it was being declined at the time because there was enough in the account to cover my order, but apparently not their extra 20%.",

I've emailed them to see if they can give me a solution.  It's pretty easy to unlock, just have to email them some documents proving its my account. Other than that, it's been pretty great!

I want to say it took me a total of 10 minutes, between re-downloading the app, filling out all the necessary information Name, DOB, address, email, you know all that lovely stuff every other site has to ask lol. You have to link a ACTIVE debt card along with the cards account to prove you have a regular income source coming in.Yes, Michigan Unemployment is totally acceptable:) I want to say it took 30 seconds to verify my bank account, Make sure my income is Consistent. Once it said I was approved I noticed I had a $50 dollar Instacash waiting for me whenever I needed it, The best part is once I asked for it it was in my linked bank account in less than a minute. Look I pretty much probably no it’s not bragging about the bank in this review on writing is probably just going to continue to grow because the cash advances not even close of the most amazing stuff that they have that they offer two of us.

It's all good, and they will send it right to my account. They give you a decent amount to work with as well. Not just a measly $20 like a Float Me. It is your choice to pay a fee to get it instantly or wait a few days to avoid the fee. Once you build trust with them by borrowing some cash and paying back what you borrowed, when you said you would on payday, then all kinds of other benefits start to open up. This includes the ability to borrow a larger sum of money than what was previously fronted to you, as well as some other lending and banking features. The only thing i would say I wish was different, would be to increase the available amount to request each time. Especially if you are trying to get more than just $50. Each time if you want it instantly (lets face it, most people either do want it fast or they really do need it fast) there is a fee to instantly receive your cash in basically minutes (for some it could possibly take a few hours). I think a good system would be, if you leave a tip of a certain amount, then the fee gets waived. It's a business and totally understandable that these people need and want to make their money, so I definitely get it. Like maybe a fee for every $100 would be a bit more reasonable. Regardless of that, I still give Money Lion 5 stars. Thanks guys.",

They won’t confirm my current status, acknowledge an error,  or even offer to look into it, they only send a link to dispute with Transunion and say they need 30 days.  They only respond with templates, and since I’ve asked to be escalated to a manager, my complaint has been ignored since.  I don’t usually write reviews like this, but this kind of credit reporting error is very harmful and in my case, totally random and false.  Plus, they know I’m current. Obviously, if a customer is stating something is wrong when they’re in good standing, they should do the right thing and assure me that they are working to fix this. Instead, I’m left to agonize.

Also, you can only take out $50 at a time through instacash and you \"should\" pay a tip on every single one of those transactions. It can add up quickly.

My only negative at this point is their direct deposit algorithm; it can predict the wrong payment day for a loan and you're forced to call ahead to try and fix it.

The credit builder account is a great option to build positive payment history and a savings account simultaneously. The only downside is that there is a $9.99 or $19.99 biweekly payment that comes along with the credit building account. I find that outrageous and a way to capitalize.

The only thing that I wish was different is the amount you can borrow at a time. I had $160 available that I could borrow but the max amount you can choose at a time is $50. If I needed to I could immediately choose to get another $50 out, and so on until the $160 available was reached. Only negative aspect is the $4.99 it charges you each time you choose to borrow money. When I borrowed $160 I ended up paying back over $179. Despite the money they tax you to borrow money its still a very useful and helpful app especially when you absolutely need money now.",

You used to let me use credit monitor without having to pay some crazy extra fee. I used to really like you. I just use this company for the free instacash. Use and abuse it until they take it away or make it mandatory to tip. This app used to be able to be designed to help you take control of your financial well being. Now.

Even if there was it was only $7400 to help pay medical bills and a few other bills that I have accrued during the pandemic(my wife is deaf and recently had surgery as well as being unable to work because she relies on reading lips mostly). Customer service was atrocious, uncaring, and vague. I have been a customer for several years and bought in to their features such as shaking your phone for cash back rewards(.05 cents for $800) or the free cash advance that they will only let you take in $50 increments and charge $3.99 if you want the \"instacash\" instant then they repeatedly ask for tips and show you pictures of people pouting. Let's do the bath $3.99 plus $2-5 tip on 50 bucks=$5.99 to 8.99. I was also told that I would not be refunded any of my money that is currently in my account which thankfully is only $8.40 but honestly it would be nice to eat this weekend even if it's Ramen noodles.

I was upset when the representative who took my call told me there was nothing that could be done. I posted this what was a negative review at the time in regards to that situation. Within 24 hours I was contacted by several different facets of MoneyLion to rectify this situation. Most inmortantly I was introduced to Kayala, over the last few weeks there have been several emails back and forth and too many missed calls to count. Kayala stuck  with me until ever issue was addressed and fixed. I am now currently active and able to use MoneyLion with no issues. Thank you so much for everyone who helped",

When common sense would presume I was referred the same date as when I made the account? Since that’s basically what I was explaining? Then my phone dies while having a dead end conversation with an agent who seemed pretty Adamant on not granting the referral origin the advertised boost.

I only learned about it when a delinquent payment appeared (and negatively impacted) on my credit report.  I have tried to report this and have found direct communication with the company’s fraud department impossible  It continues to remain unresolved after three phone calls with customer services reps who can do nothing (without the fraud department) and reports filed with the company. This company does not check credit profiles and does everything online basically making it a target for identity thieves.  They are a poorly run company and do very little to resolve issues like this where an innocent person has been harmed by their careless policies.SO MoneyLion just gave me the same BOT generated response to my issue.  They sent me that response in response to the same complaint on another website.  I did what MoneyLion asked providing more information online DIRECTLY to them and got no acknowledgement that they received it and OF COURSE NO RESPONSE FROM THEM.  This company sucks and am so frustrated.  They are truly truly unprofessional.  If I could give them less than 1 star I would.I wanted to provide an update on this complaint.  I have yet to hear from the Fraud Department (I don’t understand this) but I did get a response from a customer advocate at MoneyLion in response to this post and another post at the Better Business Bureau.  He said that they did confirm that the loan WAS fraud.  That I have no financial responsibility for it and that they have started the process of removing the loan from the credit agencies records.  I guess I am suppose to be happy about this and I do feel somewhat relieved but I still feel violated.  I will be happy when the records are corrected at the credit agencies and the harm that has been caused to my credit rating is undone. I will then remove the complaint from the Better Business Bureau  In the meantime I am surprised that the original complaint to the fraud department has NOT been answered by them.  Maybe they sent the communication to the person who took out the loan fraudulently or maybe there is an error in my email address.  I don’t know.  It would be terrific if the consumer advocate (whom I appreciate) who responded could inform the fraud department I have not gotten their official communication and let them know the correct email address  to send it to.",

Lots of options to help guide you to getting a personal loan. I have not qualified for a MoneyLion loan but they connected me to several different loan companies that they are partnered with. I mostly use the MoneyLion app for the instacash feature. It has helped me on more than one occasion when I was low on funds and in between pay days. The only thing's I dislike about the instacash feature, no matter if you qualify for $200 instacash advance, they only allow you to advance money in $50 increments, each time you advance they ask for a tip between $0-$5 dollars. If you don't tip, they try and guilt you into leaving one, with a pop up picture of a little girl with a sad face, her hand out, and the words \"Are you sure you don't want to leave NO Tip??\" They charge a $4.99 Turbo fee if you want your cash deposited instantly to your debit card or bank account. It's $3.99 if you want it deposited to your MoneyLion debt card. They also offer the standard 2-3 business days delivery method, free. It's a good a great app easy to navigate. I just think it's a little absurd to only allow instacash with draws in $50 increments and charging fees and tips each time you make your $50 max with draw. Several other apps I use either charge a $9.99 flat monthly subscription fee, on qualified instacash withdrawals. Or they allow you to withdrawal entire qualified advance amount for a small fee to receive instantly.",

They also have a great advance platform as well which includes “boosts” which are increases in the limit that one is allowed to advance. The ONLY negative Money Lion feature that I can say I’m not fond of is the way their advances are disbursed. (Ex. ML boosts increases your advancement limit to $200 and you’d like to borrow the full amount.. now you can withdraw that $200 in full but the way they have “advances” set up is max. $50 increments at a time. you can withdraw that $200 in 4 increments of $50 one after another immediately.. so you make 4 $50 requests meaning your to pay 4 tips and 4 fees.) i believe Money Lion members who pay $19.99/mo for membership should be able to withdraw their full advancement amount in one transaction. Regardless, I’m a huge fan of Money Lion and they’ve gotten me out of some ruts, and are helping me to improve my credit score. 5 Stars for ML",

I move my direct deposit to my checking there and paid everything on time. So I make my instash payment for the month and then go to try and use it well my limit have been cut in half and the payment was made on the due date and was not late. So anyways it was cut in half and I couldn't figure out why well after a little research I find that there's no proof of any of my direct deposits so it was like I was a new customer again. So I call Mr Cash to try and figure out why and if they can somehow and pretty much got told that that's how it is and maybe next month well that doesn't really fix the fact that I was really kind of depending on that oh and my repayment date had gotten changed also and was two weeks from the long day instead of the normal. I have been a pretty good customer and have paid quite a bit of money in fees and tips just last month was 65 I think in fees and tips anyways I don't think that was very fair of them at all and if it was the other way around they wouldn't accept me telling them to just pretty much deal with it and I sent a complaint email and haven't heard anything yet and I'm sorry but just not at all impressed at all and will probably end up moving all my stuff to a different bank because of it so that's my thoughts on money line in insta cash",

Until the pandemic I subsidized my modest income with \"side jobs\" from my former Accounting career.  That came to a screeching halt when Covid hit.  Being high risk I couldn't see clients in my home office any longer...  It came down to paying the utilities or eating!  I'm NOT kidding!!  In all my years I'd never been in this position.  Had it not been for ML Insta-cash tiding me over til assistance could arrive I don't know what I would have done.  I'm so grateful & humbled.  It was an added bonus not having to pay ANY interest on the advances as well.  Thank You Money Lion, I'm not a wealthy client but I am a loyal one!!",

Then it takes literally fourteen days to get a new card, the virtual card only works in limited stores and grocery stores. It's not an all out card like they say it is. Secondly the staff doesn't seem to grasp the urgency or magnitude of someone's issue their having. Sadly I been a card user for nearly two and a half years but over the past 3 months the service and customer support has been so terrible I have been ready to go back to my primary banking account and cut ties with Moneylion all together. When trying to apply for loans it doesn't let you update your account if you've lost access. It forces you to try to get your old account information over and over again.",
