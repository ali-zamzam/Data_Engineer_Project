I'm not sure why it would say deposited the next day but when I logged in just to find out I have to wait two to five business days. I just needed the money to get by until payday but It seems I will get paid before it is even deposited. Just a little confused because in my email and at the top it said it will be deposited today and haven't received the deposit or any emails regarding the loan except to leave a review and that funds would be available today.

The amount of information they ask for when they claim you are preapproved is simply unbelievable!!! It rivals a home mortgage and I’m not over exaggerating.

Three months worth of FULL (every single page) bank statements, access and login information to your personal checking account, plus a slew of other things! That’s an invasion of privacy it’s none of their business what I spend my money on. Absolutely under no circumstances should you waste your time dealing with this company. And you can take that to the bank, because it’s the ONLY thing you’re going to take to the bank from them…No doubt like my other reviews, they will promptly respond (it’s the only time you will get a prompt response from them) and try to make it sound like they genuinely care, tell you to please call this number and ask to speak to a member of management, they are awaiting your call, blah blah, and it’s just the EXACT same every day 800 number that you can never get through on or speak to a human. In fact there’s not even an option to speak to somebody!!! You have to work your way around it going through the back door and picking wrong options. If by some miracle you do get through? The people who pick up the phone don’t have a freaking CLUE about you or your review! They just make a response to save face and mislead the reader into thinking they care.Walk away from their offers. Better yet? RUN.Update: Like I stated.

One to pay off my account, and one my wife's account. 1 month later, neither accounts are paid off. The check for my wife's account was cashed, but NEVER applied to her account. The check for my account was \"lost,\" and never cashed. To investigate anything they require a ton of leg work from you, and then just tell you to wait....

Anyways I was truly so happy when the letter came because it was the perfect amount i was needing for my family at the time and I knew I was going to be able to pay it off quickly. I went online verified my info and entered my routing and account number. It was doing anything when i hit apply so I called just to find out I was not approved but was actually denied and she wasnt able to tell me why. She said it may be because of the bank I use but why would they send letters lying saying your approved for a certain amount when in reality you might not be. It was a lie and really got my hopes up and was so happy thinking i was going to be able to get what I needed for my family. seriously so depressing really sucks",

I went in and applied with my offer and was immediately approved. And the funds were in my account the next day. The reason I’m given 4 stars and not 5 stars is because the only thing I don’t like is the amount that is expected to be paid back it’s kinda expensive but other then that I recommend CashNetUSA to anyone who is in need of extra cash for emergency purposes or you just need the extra cash to help yourself out.

I was finally able to secure a debt consolidation loan, and my balance finally reads zero, but I have lost so much money, over $400 rent. I’ve been there, and I know why you’re considering borrowing. Just think twice because if you can’t pay it back and you can only make the minimum payments, you’ll never pay off this debt. I learned my lesson the hard way, not saying don’t do it. If I hadn’t, I’d be homeless but just think twice about it. Also, at least when I first borrowed, it started at $500, then it was raised again and again and again until I was at $2500; if you don’t have reasonable impulse control, this is not a loan for you.",

Then I checked of to allow electronic transfers and supplied them with the name of my bank, routing number and account number. What raised RED FLAGS was when I was asked for my banking user name and password.

Its like a credit card... but I took the full amount it allowed and it said my first payment would be $95.. so shouldn't all my payments be $95 and not $330? Paying off asap.

WELL That's NOT WHAT HAPPENED ! The very next day 4/29 I called first thing in the morning and paid off my loan but when I tried to get a new loan an incorrect due date appeared, I was still on the phone with the woman and she tells me you will not be able to do your loan today if you need a different due date . Im like but I was told I could do another loan yesterday with no problem , I asked her can you extend the due date by 2 days please so I can take my loan today it is Friday and I need the instant funding because the weekend is coming and I cant get instant funding on the weekend , she again told me I would have to wait until Monday to reapply for my loan. I called back a couple of hours later to ask if I took my loan on Sunday 5/1, when would I receive funding , well THIS NEW WOMAN SAID I COULD HAVE TAKEN MY LOAN THIS MORNING  , FRIDAY AT THE SAME TIME I CALLED AND DID MY PHONE PAYMENT AND THEY COULD GO IN TO MY ACCOUNT AND ADJUST THE DUE DATE FOR ME MANUALLY , SO THE LADY FROM THIS MORNING  WAS WRONG AND BECAUSE OF HER  IT WAS NOW TO LATE IN THE DAY TO DO MY LOAN WITH INSTANT FUNDING AND THAT SHE WAS SORRY . I told her this whole experience was  so awful and that now I would have an additional $100 fee to one of my bills because I would not able to pay my bill due on 5/1 on time because I was not able to get my loan with instant funding so know my payment will be late because I cant get funding until 5/2 all because I was not given the proper information in the first place . I told her I would like to make a complaint because this was not right Im a good customer and I don't deserve this. SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS FILLING OUT A FORM AND THAT THE MANAGEMENT TAKES THESE ISSUES VERY SERIOUSLY AND A SUPERVISOR WOULD CALL ME BACK FOR SURE ON THE SAME DAY , FRIDAY 4/29. TWO DAYS KNOW AND NO ONE EVER CALLED ME BACK SO THIS IS WHY I LEFT A REVIEW TO LET PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THIS COMPANY DID TO ME AND IM A TO GOOD CUSTOMER! CUSTOMERS DO NOT DESERVE TO BE TREATED LIKE THIS AND THEN JUST IGNORED WHEN THEY TRY TO REACH OUT .          UPDATE,  There is nothing you can do now . A supervisor was supposed to call me a couple of days ago and sort this out and try and help me but no one ever reached out and called me back as promised. It was not a supervisor that responded below, it was only customer service . Anyways, it's a little too late to help me now with the instant need I had  last Friday, unfortunately.",

I was approved right away and they even offered 40$ a month for payments! I don't want to hear about you all complaining about the interest and payment fees. IT'S A LOAN It's not suppose to be given to you ALL THE TIME, they're there to help you when times get rough and you need emergency funding temporarily.

They take payments out twice like a interest payment then the actual payment of the loan. Every time they take money out its a different percentage and it's higher. So if you are paying a note  for 120 they will take that plus 8 dollars a day so add 8xhow ever many days in the month and see exactly how they are ripping you off!! Thats why the loan so easy to get! The way this is set up you will never pay this loan off. My daughter borrowed 700.00 and been making payments but they dont reflect on the loan until you pay the interest down to 3 percent so now her loan is 1500. 00 this is a straight rip off.

I sent a cashiers check to pay off my account and first the man on the phone gave me the WRONG address to send the check. I had to call to get the payoff amount. My check was returned to the bank because of the address and my bank said that this it rather customary because it gives them more time to add interest to your account and at 299% yearly that is can be anywhere from a few dollars and up. Mine got up to $15+ a day while waiting for this HORRID company to fix my account...but they STILL want the interest and refuse to fix it. My bank sent the check out a second time to the correct address and CashNet USA cashed my check but then the next month reversed the check off my account but never returned the funds. Also in going over my account VERY CAREFULLY I found MANY discrepencies. There were a few months where they took payment but NEVER posted it to my account or reversed the payment and never returned the monies. On 1/14/21 my year to date interest was $134.70 with $260.42 charged for the month. Then on 2/11/2021 my year to date interest was $1,053.26 with $322.60 charged in interest for the month. I'm not a math teacher but that doesn't add up. I reached out to the company SEVERAL times to fix these issues but to no avail. Finally I gave up...and they stopped harassing me mid 2021. Well a couple months ago I found out that they sent my account to a collection agency for  an unpaid and delinquent account . I had to go back to my bank to get a copy of the cashed cashier's check dated 10/14/2020. I THINK this is finally settled...but the collection agency is not responding to my emails...so who knows. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY...but if circumstances in your life require you to use a cash advance loan shark CAREFULLY and DILIGENTLY go over EVERY statement and transaction!!!

In my opinion most people only want to not pay it off and rip you off due to the fact that they have to pay $3,000 for only $1,000 in the long run if you don’t pay the loan off the next day you’ll be broke. People with bad credit or in my case brand new credit should be given the privilege of getting such a low apr. Most people with fantastic credit scores are only like that because they got money or it took them there whole life( at least that’s what I’ve seen). I’m not rich I’m 18 make little money unless I hit my 60 hour mark. But I’ve got two cars(27,986 and 29,999)three credit cards(Total available credit 750) and never missed a payment in my life, my utilization rate 10%. But I did bring my credit from 300 to 600 in less than 2 months. And yet I’m still stuck with. 23% apr on both my vehicles. Even know I do everything correct make payments on time. So think of yourself as a company do you want to be the ones that people hate and only thrive for the money than be my guest, a company should thrive for helping there economy, for there people, and for there pride. Sure the company I work for is extremely wealthy one of the wealthiest in the world. But they better the economy, on god there for the people, everything I’ve seen the company do even as a whole has been extremely life changing to me and everyone in this world.

I’ve paid back the loan and then some! I will be closing my account/stopping payment to lock them out! It’s ridiculous. You basically NEVER PAY THE LOAN OFF. You will be trapped into a vicious cycle!

        "reviews": "So CashNet was very great in the process of allowing me to receive the $2,000 line of credit even with bad credit, so I applaud them on that factor of trust as a consumer. Yes I do understand it was a 2-300% interest of line of credit, but the daily rate charge of $16 for my first billing cycle is just insane. Yes I understand that the interest rate is what it is and due to the loan amount. But at minimum payment of an expected 2 and a half years would have totaled about $12,000 on a $2,000 line of credit. That's ridiculous and better off with a personal loan on a 12 month payment plan. The customer service was more than great trying to answer my understanding of the current pay off amount. Customer service isn't the issue, but the interest rate of the business, (yes I agreed upon) compounded within the first month was just too much. In total, for a $2,000 line of credit I had withdrawn at max in to my account mid August, I paid a total off $2,791. (09/14/2021)…$800 of total fees and APR within the first month. Sure you could pay off more, but that compounded APR DAILY is what gets you. I advise to just get a payday loan, even at $2,000...8 pay day loans paid off after a month would have only been $400. without transfer fees. That's a lot of loans, but even if you only needed say $750. its more reasonable to get a pay day loan than paying $350-250 for 24 months. 3 stars for the great customer service, -2 for the compounded interest. Just get a personal loan or payday loan. Oh and I tried to ask how to close my account on the site Chat with \"Britney\" she gave misleading information. I asked how and she said you can't and the account closes after 7 years of inactivity. I asked \"so you CANNOT close my account after I've paid off the total balance? She said NO.  This is False. After your last payment clears and you're at zero balance owed, you simply call TO CLOSE the account (takes 2-3 business days). Your INFORMATION stays with the company for 7 years. You can close your account after you've paid your total amount.",

The website is nearly useless, you can't skip a payment or request a payoff there. They say that they were helping people during the pandemic, but I didn't see it. If you skipped a payment, the interest still accrued, and in two weeks, you now have two payments due. If you want to postpone the second one, you have to use their inefficient phone system.

Their customer service is exceptional! Any time I have called in, the agent has been, kind, friendly, and helpful. A word of warning though. This is NOT a long term solution because the interest is very high. This is more of a stopgap between paychecks tool. Never borrow more than you can comfortably pay back in a month or two!! I do have to say though that their fees are very transparent (costly, but transparent lol) and that if you understand what you are getting into, this loan product can be a life saver!",

I sent them a benefit letter for each Social Security direct deposit, and like 8 different screenshots showing those deposits and the direct deposits of each of the pensions. I kept checking today, the 13th. They send me an email once again saying it was withdrawn and to fill out the application again and send a copy of my most recent paystub. Hello? I dont get a paystub.

I am a hotel front desk agent, and what Cash Net USA did was equivalent of me checking a guest into an occupied room. One mistake that is supposed to never be tolerated was made by Cash Net USA. I will no longer do business with Cash Net USA. I do business with a few other payday advance agencies, and none of them have ever sent me money, and ended up funding the wrong account.

This week started doing doordash and Papa as an extra income as well. He still denied it and told me that i can apply again after working 30 days with an employer.  i told him that after working 30 days with an employer i certainly know where not to go :) and that i don't have employers i am my employer.  Please if you can choose another place to get your funds from, do it. I really thought this pandemic would teach us all a lesson but it seems some learned and some just got worse.

Not every day goes as planned and sometimes you have something happen where you need just a little boost to get by or have the need to have a bit more cash on hand. For example if one of my suppliers runs a special and I need a few hundred I can have it in my bank the next day to take advantage of the offer. I travel a lot. If I needed a set of tires and am a little tight on cash - bang it's there the next day. Depending on the time of day it can be there by end of that business day.",

I applied for a payday loan to help replace the food etc that I lost in the disaster once our power came back up.  I didn't think I would get approved as I had no credit at all. They approved me and it was a lifesaver.  I have been a loyal customer ever since and they have been there through emergencies etc and now I have my first credit card in 25 years. If you find yourself in a bind and have no where to turn do yourself a favor and reach out to them.  Borrow what you can afford to pay back and pay your loan off and they will be loyal to you and there when you need them.  Everyone needs help every now and then.

I contacted CASHNETUSA customer service to update my banking info so that payments wouldn’t fail and when I get into a chat a rep named “ALEX” was very unprofessional after I reached out to them after making a payment he/she insisted on telling me this is an attempt to collect a debt... I still have credit to draw from and Alex may need some very extensive training as this type of behavior or service will run away consumers that intend to pay their debts.  Not only this, if my account is in good standing and I have a LOC to draw from why are you throwing debt collection in my face.  This is a result of poor training and not only this your agent ended the chat not caring about what I had to say. I recently got approved for my SBA loan and I will be giving the $1000 back that I borrowed. It’s not worth keeping a line of credit.  Hey All! Small business owner here who never expected to have to take out a loan after so many lucrative years as a stylist and small business accountant. Still awaiting the SBA I swallowed my pride and applied with cashnetusa because my credit score is only around 644. The app process was quick and easy and was approved in literally 20 minutes for a line of credit.

First of all, before I go on my rant I will say I haven’t found myself in a payment bind nor have I had any experience working with their customer service team. My review is strictly off of the 275.85% yearly APR, and In addition multiple other daily fees. If you are in a life and death situation I’d say go for it (bc how worst can it get), but you are literally paying whole car note payments . Most of your bi weekly payment is interest. I was initially paying 4-500 dollars monthly on $1,600 loan with barely no movement in the loan going down. Now I owe $1100(paid extra on one of the payments ) which is $330/monthly payment. So I’ll be doing what I didn’t want to do and pull out of my 401K to pay this off this loan this week because this loan will never get paid off. you would literally have to pay twice the monthly amount to see any difference.Please listen and stay away. This is an expensive trap that you will kick yourself in the leg for later. I’m thankful my credit situation has turned itself around. 🙏🏾",

However the interest is crazy! And they charge you interest  everyday. They don’t care if you have never missed a payment. I had only received the loan for $500. I have paid them so far $915.98, and they still say I have $368.45 out standing balance. And I got this loan originally in 8/14/2020, and I have not borrow from them since. So please don’t use this company, it’s not worth it. If you are strapped for cash. Try another company I will not use this company ever again or recommend it to anyone",

Although the interest is a little outrageous I received the funds I needed within 24 hours of the initial contact. I hit some bumps in the road when some of my due dates come up a few different times. Each time I contacted them and they helped set up payment arrangements that were easily affordable.Each and every one of the representatives I spoke to over the phone or chatted with online were all very helpful, knowledgeable, friendly, and empathetic to my situation, but most of all understanding that I too was a human being with actual issues. They also understood they were not the only bill I had to pay and Rent, Groceries, and Gas were more important to pay.  They also have options which allow you to pay off your loan or line of credit early. This for me was an excellent option because some companies do not allow you to payoff early because they want every penny they can squeeze out of you. If you are in a pinch and need some help quickly I would recommend CashnetUSA.",

They prefer ach so they can force your bank. I thought it would be like a higher interest credit card but Cash Net managed to far out pace a bad credit card in fees.

Therefore you are not able to reapply until after 3:30 PM and funds are not sent to your account until the following business day which would be Monday.This is definitely misleading and false advertisement.

At this rate I’ll be paying for the next 5 years!! DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR ANYONE!!! So glad they are not offered in Va anymore. It’s probably because everyone got tired of being robbed of their money!!

I just received a letter in the mail January 2021 about how they've sent me to collections on a $350 debt that I don't owe. I took pictures and documented everything and I paid them off IN FULL. They said they only credited $1000 even though my bank account shows that it was charged more than that for the full month. Every time I try to call the people are completely useless. Their customer service is just as atrocious as their 300% interest rates. If they were going to send me to collections for a debt I already paid, why wait a year and a half? Were they hoping I would forget about it so they could get more money from me? This is the worst place I have ever done business with and I'm not paying a penny more to them.Edit: I've called twice and the customer service reps refused to help me and all they did was tell me to call collections. They said they could only drop it if I get a letter from cashnetusa  saying that my debt was paid in full which you refuse to do. My debt was $1,133.44 and I paid you $1,134. They only credited my account with paying $1,000, so did you pocket the extra $134? I even called cashnetusa THAT DAY and they said I paid it off. When I called collections they said you sold my \"debt\" to collections 9 days after I paid it off, but I just got a letter about it THIS MONTH, almost a year and a half later saying I owe $350. So, no. I won't be calling your joke of customer service. What I will do is go to the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Consumer Affairs.

Secondly, if they looked at my pay now compared to the last time, it was decreased which means I couldn’t afford the larger amount! Also. In my business with them, I have never applied for a large amount! I have always kept it between $500-$600. I am very disappointed in the company. I needed the money to help with medical costs. I will go elsewhere for a loan and will not do any more business with this company again!

I’m contacting the better business bureau IMMEDIATELYUPDATE: I called them today after receiving an email saying that I was not approved even though I got an email yesterday saying I was approved. This thing is a whole mess they said back in 2007 I applied for a loan with them and I used  a JP Morgan Chase bank account at that time. Well that is not the bank that I used when I applied yesterday. I don’t have that bank account anymore and haven’t since 2007. So they took it upon themselves to try send my loan to a closed bank account. I was advised this morning to wait until January 8th for Chase Bank to reject the loan. This place is the only source where they have a decent review rating. Everywhere else people have nightmares dealing with them...makes me wonder. So now I need to wait until the 8th and  pray that I don’t become one of the nightmare stories of them hounding me for money that I never received. Do your research!My Customer #11343840My full name is Chiemeri Collins. I am a real customer. I received an email today asking me to verify that information like anyone would make up something like this..",

I made the extra payments to bring down my principle balance but the way they have these loans set up is to take as much principle up front as possible.  Which prevents anyone from paying them down quickly.  They are never able to tell me when is the best time to make an additional payment that benefits me.  Total SHAM!

I put in my information but each time a I pushed Submit it was not accepted. so I could not complete the app. But Cash Net USA did not know this. so I will have to wait 30 days before I can apply to them again for a loan. My Bank noticed a lot of recurring charges on my account that I did not authorize and four of them were from credit score reporting sites. They had been charging my acc. $34.98 each month. My Bank made them put it back. I thank the site I was sent to was one of them.and that's why I could not submit to get my credit score. I called Cash Net USA and they explain to me clearly why I could not complete there app, and gave me some good advice about applying for a loan. And also what to look out for.

This should bring the balance down and possibly my payments..wrong my balance would go up like i said $3-$4 and my payment fluxed between same $10. I hate when large companies think its okay to take from a needing hard honest bill paying person. Who has NEVER missed a payment OR EVEN ASKED FOR AN EXTESION DURING THE COVID PANDEMIC. Wow...really CNUSA jst replied a vague response. Im nit complaining about the contract. Im upset that upon my 2nd and 3rd issue of money your company stole from me.

They make the pay back affordable and less stressful.

But did  I have a Warrant out for my arrest.  I called CashNetUSA, immediately still trying to stop shaking and breath.  Their representative was great, had me read the whole letter to her.  We went over my Payments everything fine. She helped me calm down and let me know no Warrant. No judgement nothing. Thank God for a company that has real people on the phone and was able to help me.

If you can’t pay on due date they don’t hesitate to help and understand tough times happen and they grant you extensions or payment plan if you need it. Love CashNet - so go go go!!!

But making monthly payments is a no. My BI WEEKLY PAYMENTS were 250. A piece so 500 overall. My loan was for 1700. No matter how much I paid or did I could NOT pay it off. I also asked for a settlement offer just anything to get this debt off me and account closed. Customer service informed me that they don’t do settlement offers which I’m sure is a lie. Anyways I did some debt consolidation and just paid the whole thing off and I hope to never deal with these ppl again . Definitely would not recommend as a lender . The high interest rate makes it impossible for you to pay them off. Yesterday my payoff was 1823 and today my payoff was 1872 . Please unless you’re seriously desperate do not go this route ! There are definitely better lenders with lower interest . Good luck",

Awhile later I hadn't gotten my funds yet so i called and gave my account number to confirm, they also said it was correct. I called back one more time not understanding why NY funds are not in the account just to find out, it wasn't the right account number. I tried giving her the right number and was told I couldn't, and it could take up to 5 business days to correct then error. Is this some kind of scam to get my social security number, bank info. Etc??? U can either deposit it on the right account as I asked or I can take it up on social media, the new, or better yet my father works for a radio station out here called The Fox.

CashNetUSA due dates fall around the 11th. and the 28th, this can cause you to get hit with an NSF. If you're not watchful, you'll find yourself borrowing more just to meet the minimum payments and find yourself worse off than before.Stuff happens so it's good to shop around and not only read but comprehend the fine print before signing.

I tend to do the monthly loan, yeah, the $50ish fee for just doing a few bucks for a couple hundred. Banks r constantly being bailed out, but we have to beg for help becuz the banks, and all lending companies, interest charges are ridiculous.

I Called them on payday and gave them my credit card..to pay off my 500.00 loan Then when I went online and saw I could now borrow my old 1800.00 I was going to go ahead and fix the back yard fawcett and fix my indoor bathtub fawcett. I am having problems with it too.I apllied and spoke with this girl and she said she would put it through.Then I got a call from cashnet usa about 10 minutes later and I answered it and they hung up..this was in the morning then about 530pm I get another call from a different girl telling me that now I have to send her my bank statements.Hmmmm thats odd after two years of loans from them and a loan I just did 2 weeks ago and paid back now I have to send them my personal bank account statements ..( and these people are working from home) No way I am not sending my bank statements to anyone.This just does not sound right all of a sudden now they need my bank statements.So I told Her I don't want to do the loan because I am not going to send ANYONE my bank statements they want to loan me the money and get the 300.00 or 400.00 back from loaning it to me that's fine ..But its not fine that all of a sudden they need my bank statements.So the next day I called to speak with a supervisor and of course not available and then this rep told me that I now need my front and back of my ID and I also Need my Bank statements too. I told her I want to know why now you need them after more than 2 years.(She couldn't give me an answer)I won't be using Cashnet USA anymore they won't be making several thousand dollars off me ANYMORE ( I have opted out my info to them on their end) and I have other Companies who will loan me money with my bank account info my social security number and my signature.I USED TO WORK FOR CITI BANK FOR 10 YEARS AND I AM NOT APLLYING FOR A HOME LOAN ( THEY DO NOT NEED YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION UNLESS THEY ARE PLANNING ON SELLING IT OR USING IT ) THIS IS A SMALL LOAN FOR 1800.00 NOT A 50,0000 OR HIGHER LOAN.ITS ALRIGHT ITS THEIR LOSS NOT MINE BECAUSE THERE IS ALOT OF OTHER LOAN COMPANIES THAT WILL BE HAPPY TO TAKE MY MONEY FOR BORROWING SHORT TERM FOR EMERGENCIES.DONT WASTE YOUR TIME UNLESS YOU LIKE GIVING ALL YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO A SMALL PAYDAY LOAN COMPANY WHICH I JUST WOULDN'T RECCOMEND TO DO. ESPECIALLY SINCE COVID AND PEOPLE OUT OF WORK AND PEOPLE DESPERATE FOR MONEY.NO WAY! I WOULD ONLY USE A COMPANY THAT NEEDS THE BASIC PROPER INFORMATION. ANYTHING MORE I WOULD BE VERY LEARY AND SUSPICIOUS..ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE GUARANTEED INCOME COMMING IN ON A REGULAR BASIS COVID OR NO COVID.AND OPT OUT OF COMPANIES IF YOUR NOT PLANNING TO USE THEM AGAIN..AND FYI  A SUPERVISOR NEVER CALLED ME BACK EITHER.THANK YOU CASHNET USA FOR SHOWING ME WHO & WHAT KIND OF COMPANY YOU REALLY ARE..",

It is a set up and unfortunately i was suckered. They don't explain to you that the interest is accrued $10 daily regardless of your due date. ex: If your payments are 175.00 bi weekly only $75 will be applied to your principle $100 towards interest but by the time your next due date the $10 daily interest had accrued. It is will take me 18 months to pay off this TRAPPED loan.  These people are a rip off. i will look into filing a class action suit . i do not recommend applying for line of credit with CASH NET.

        "reviews": "CASHNET USA REVIEWMarch 2019After weeks of applying ppersonal loans and being rejected for pre-qualifications apps due to poor credit (below 600), CashNet.USA was the first lender to take a chance on me. I found the process fast and painless and was approved within minutes of applying. I needed $1000 and was approved for $850 (which at this time, beggars can’t be choosers). A couple hours after I requested my advance, it was cancelled as I needed additional documents sent such as my recent paystub and driver’s license. Once I emailed the missing documents, I received a response within 12 hours approving me to submit another request for my advance. The next business day, the full amount was in my account. (Keep in mind: the balance you must payback is the requested amount +15% fee). At this point, I found the customer service fast and was pleased with the results.June 2019Quick update: my credit score has improved since I was able to withdraw this loan. However, I am nowhere near paying off the balance. The payment dates are set up based on what you submit for frequency of payment (biweekly, bimonthly, etc). My contract has me on a biweekly payment schedule and that daily interest is no joke. Lets just say, for every $160 I pay, $140 gets added back in interest by the time the next due date comes around. The goal is to pay back 2x the amount from here on out . All in all, it’s nice that they worked with me during my time of need, but I definitely trapped myself in a vicious cycle of “borrowing money to pay back other borrowed money”. July 2020Another Update: here we are a year from when I applied for the loan and I’m sad to say that I’m almost halfway paid off. I will admit that since June 2019, I have cashed out $50 here and there, with my last withdrawal being back in Jan 2020. Despite my mistakes, I have continued making my payments on a biweekly schedule, throwing in extra ($15-25) every other payment or when funds are expandable for the month. As it stands today, I’m still pleased with CashNet but I really must caution all prospective borrowers to seriously research all of their options and make sure they’re in a financial position to borrow any amount from any lender, but especially cashnet.",

The line of credit adds interest to your account everyday depending on how much you borrow. My loan adds between 40 and 50 dollars daily for a month. By the time my payment comes out only a couple of dollars goes toward my loan, the rest is interest. With my payday loan I always made 4 payments and it was paid off. Do not except lines of credit.  If they don't do payday loans in your state please consider another way to get the money you need.  They are worst than loan sharks. I wish I had read the terms first  but I just assumed it worked like the payday loans. Been with them for years. I called a said I couldn't make my payment of 347.00 dollars so they told me I could pay 128.00. When payment came due, they charged me the 128.00 plus the 347.00. How was that for help. If I could afford the 347.00 why would they think I could afford 2 payments at once. That was almost 500.00. My account paid it and I had an over draft fee.PLEASE RECONSIDER YOUR OPTIONS BEFORE DEALING WITH THESE PEOPLE.  If it's a payday loan that's fine but PLEASE DON'T DO A LINE OF CREDIT.

It should be illegal what they do but I’m sure some lobbyist has paid off senators to keep them in business. I got $1400 and when I started paying it off they lowered it to $1100 and said it was due to Covid. So at a time of crisis you lower my line of credit. Ended up paying back over $3000 in just 6 months and that was because I paid it off early. Not worth it. Please listen to my review and steer clear.",

Do not fall for the reviews on their site.

They have always been professional and while I needed the money this type of credit line in the end becomes a greater debt than the orginal reason for my request. I would highly recommend a traditional loan and if you can't get one borrow from family and pay them back. Exhaust all your possibilities before considering a credit line even if you have bad credit. If it weren't for the ridiculous 299% interest rate they would other wise be fine. In addition in light of COVID 19 you'd think the company with all the money they have made would bring the interest down to a traditional one to help their customers instead they reduce the credit line line which isn't horrible but the monthly cost still...is outrageous. Please look at your options before coming to this company.

The next day (there was around 6 hours left in the curent day) around 10:00 AM I get a call from Alana the manager while I was with a client of my own. I asked if I could call her back. Maybe 30 min later I call. I am told she would call me right then. She didn't return my call that day. I called again asking why no call. I'm told she would call me in \"less than an hour\". Still no call. Today she calls. Understand that I don't really care for my given first name and have gone by my middle name for about 45 years. After I point out this fact Alana, or as I shall refer to as Lucy, calls me by first name every time she speaks and tells me that she has to. That's just the rudest thing I have ever heard of. Back to the point. Lucy tells me that I should have taken a screenshot of the web page showing the $822 balance and since I didn't have that she wouldn't do anything. So I am left with having to pay over $200 more plus $5 of interest charged while waiting for Lucy to do nothing.

Poor people in a bind look towards these kinds of companies for quick money but it is NOT worth dealing with. You'll be in an endless circle of debt that you'll never get out of. I paid $400 towards my line of credit and my balance went UP. At that point, im the fool for even signing the contract. This is a warning. FIND ANOTHER PLACE TO GET A LOAN.

It doesn't matter how much you pay down as you still pay the interest rate based on taking out the complete loan. Mine was a $1,000$ loan. Every day it added 8-10$ to the principle. I paid down 200$ towards it and same amount each day. I paid another hundred towards it a day later and same amount put back on the card each day. It's down to 776$ this past Sunday and I look at it now and it's back up to 826$. That's a crooked rate but they can do that because of how POS the place is. I put down 300$ more towards it but will just pay the thing off with my next check and never come back to them. There are laws in place that protect consumers from BD interest rates like this but I guess that doesn't apply to this type of company. It's the reason why they don't report to credit agencies. It's very shady and if I were you I'd sell something or put something you own up for collateral at a bank. This is the old mafia way of doing business. That's my honest review. I had no where to go and they helped me out so without options they take advantage of you. Such is life, right?",

According to their own service representatives and their website, this loan should have been transferred to my bank by the end of the day. By late that night my ACH transfer was not even showing up as pending in my account. I talked to a representative at 9:31 pm CT of that same night, and they could see nothing wrong with my ACH transfer, and was told to call back in the morning, since they have until 11:59 pm to post. It is now 7:45 am CT 3/10/20 and the funds are still not even pending in my account. I gave them a call back trying to figure out what is going on; and apparently their system is so f*cked that it took the bank account information I had input CORRECTLY, and changed it to the last for digits of my account (which wasn't even entered, as their system doesn't allow the \"-\" key to be entered. My account number looks lik XXXXXXXXX-0001 or -0002.. the last 4 digits are to distinguish savings and checking).So now, not only are the funds not sent to my account, I have to wait until 3/11/20 for them to receive the money back, and only then can I attempt to fix their mistake and attempt to get the loan I needed on the 9th.Don't bother with this company, their website is set up poorly ( the timezone of the site doesn't match the timezone they are actually in and use... their system auto corrects banking information to the point it won't actually transfer), and they can't even help you when their system makes a mistake.By the time this would get sorted out, I will have gotten my actual paycheck, and already have to pay late fees, so this service offered me nothing but a waste of my time and energy.Now I'm sure since this is a 1 star review they're going to copy and paste an auto response to this comment.

You'll end up paying 4k - 5k total in about 10 months, if you don't borrow against it again, for a 1500 dollar loan. The 300 payday loan is alright-ish, but stay away from the line of credit.

WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITH $100!?! THAT'S WHAT I TIP THE GUY WHO DETAILS MY MERCEDES!!! KEEP READING!***UPDATED REVIEW*** This 1st paragraph is updated 8/5/2020, but continue to read, because chances are my first review will apply to you personally. I'm just updating, that I have sold one of my houses (I have 2 more) and in the middle of selling one of my small businesses (I have 1 more), and have made more money during this SCAMdemic than EVER before. If this BUSINESS sale goes thru, said and done, I would've made nearly or just over $600,000 this year, ALONE. That being said, I've paid down ALL of my debt, and I'm sitting at 14% total utilization with $26,000 total overall revolving credit. After waiting for nearly 2 MONTHS, my credit score, RIGHT NOW, IS 790, again with flawless payment history on EVERYTHING. I paid off over $17k in debt. My Fico is around 740. I'M STILL NOT QUALIFIED. Now, Obviously I DON'T NEED A LOAN, I JUST WANTED TO SEE IF THIS COMPANY STANDS BEHIND WHAT THEY CLAIM. AT THIS EXACT TIME, WITH MY CREDIT SCORES IN THE TOP 18% OF THE ENTIRE COUNTRY, I ONLY QUALIFY FOR $255 HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!! I wish a quarter star was an option!! Original review starts below so please read for the ones who don't have the credit that I have. Don't get dinged if you don't absolutely have to. Ok. I believe I've written a 5 star review before, because they've been such an outstanding lender over the past couple years, so let me explain why I am now giving therm just one star.First, I have a PERFECT credit history. Fico of about 660 or so.19 years of 100% on time payments. I carry about $10k in debt, but perfect, PERFECT on time payment history, and only 1 account in collections (the police department in So. Cal actually stole one of my show cars (swear on everything I know and love!!!!) and stuck me with an impound fee, and auctioned it off when they knew i was out of town for 5 weeks, TRUE STORY) and it will stay there until it falls off my credit report in 2 more years. Other than that, perfect.I have applied and successfully obtained 2 loans from cashnetusa. The first was for $2600. Got the loan in March of 2018. I MADE EVERY SINGLE PAYMENT ON TIME, AND HAD THE LOAN COMPLETELY PAID OFF BY THAT FOLLOWING JULY. Yes, within 4 months. Everything was hunky dory.Constantly bombarded by emails begging me to re-loan, because of attorney fees, I decided to reapply, and received ANOTHER $2600 loan last February of 2019, I believe. Again, I MADE EVERY SINGLE PAYMENT ON TIME, AND HAD THE LOAN COMPLETELY PAID OFF BY THAT FOLLOWING OCTOBER, as in 4 months ago (2019). NEVER LATE, NEVER MISSING A SINGLE PAYMENT. Again, I receive numerous daily emails asking me to re-loan, now for up to $3300 and special 'benefits'.Today, I open an email from Cashnetusa, and go to apply. I was told by \"upswing\", which is part of Cashnetusa, that I qualify for a 6% lower APR, and a \"delay-a-pay\" feature, because of my perfect track record. I logon, and to my surprise, I'm only qualified for $255. I navigate the website, log out, and log back in. Still, only $255. So I just called them and asked them what happened to my Upswing Loan amount of $3300. The lady sees my account history, and agrees with me and says \"That IS strange. I don't know. Let me put you on hold and ask my manager whats going on. You're not the first person to call about this issue.\" SUPER nice lady BTW...so I agree. She comes back and says \"My manager said that its computer generated and you're only eligible for $255, but maybe in the future, you'll qualify for an Upswing loan.\" I said \"What!?! YOU guys send me the emails and offers!!! So, you're telling me, you offer me 'benefits' and 'perks', that aren't eligible for the 'payday loan', and despite my perfect payment history with you guys, and everyone else in my financial web, you won't allow me to loan, or honor your email solicitations? I would think that you guys would WANT customers proven to repay their debts!!! WTH!!\" and all she can say is exactly what she had said a couple minutes prior. \"It's system generated and you'll just have to wait to see if you qualify and get invited again.\" Well, how can I NOT!?!? Do you guys actually want people that have no intention of paying you back? How do you make money!?!So, what once was a prosperous, generous, and what I personally considered to be the BEST small amount lender just took a HUGE L. I will no way, ever, reapply to them after what they've just done to a LOYAL, PERFECT, 100% ON TIME PAYING AND PAYING OFF CUSTOMER, EVEN IF $3300 WILL BREAK ME. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED, AND THEY LOST A TRUE CUSTOMER OVER THIS BS.",

I got the money fast but it was not at all worth it.  Do not borrow from Cash Net USA unless you like giving away your hard earned money.

However this most recent time the loan was repaid as usual through my bank on autopay on time and Cashnet's website shows it was paid on time on 1/17/20, however 6 days later Veritec is still showing the loan outstanding. A call to Cashnet referred me to Veritec. A call to Veritec referred me back to Cashnet. Another call to Cashnet and I was told there was nothing that could be done. Needless to say I'm a little disappointed and still unsure of what to do.Response to reply from CashNet -7:00pm ETI did call and was told that they cannot view why Veritec denied it. I explained that I understood that and that was why I was told to call Veritec and Veritec said they can’t view CashNet only that my account was still being reported open. When I asked CasNet what else I could do they told me to call Veritec. I’m just being bounced back and forth with both sides saying they can’t do anything.Second reply. -  9:30pm ET After much frustration CashNet finally got things straightened out.

No one can seem to tell me what my total pay back will be nor how much longer i will be paying. I will not be recommending this company.

DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE. PREDATORY!

I wanted to get a small loan to help me bridge my finances, upcoming bills as well as Christmas.  I just found a great new job but I haven't been there long enough to get caught up on my money situation. I saw a familiar commercial for CashNet USA as I was getting ready for work, went online and filled out my application (very fast-very easy) and received an approval within 30 minutes and had the funds in my account by mid-afternoon. Not only was I totally impressed with their simple and easy process but by having the funds deposited the same day, well it just took the weight of my financial burden off my shoulders and the stress out of my gut.  You can't go wrong by giving them a few minutes of your time by filing out their forms online. I bet that you will have your financial hiccups sorted out as quickly as I did!!!!!",

Example if u get paid every two weeks they will be taking it out every two weeks and a 200.00 payment on a 1200 loan just goes to interest and you are not paying anything on the loan.  If you get in a bind like your hours are cut, they will not offer you any options that are helpful only another payment divided up so no you have two loan payments out there! Every two weeks coming out your checks so it’s not helping you financially ,   Their are other loans out there way better than this!!  Try them instead.  Lend up is way better than this company.

REALLY? Had two other loans and now you can't tell who I am. Not a great way to run a company. Poor customer service and just not a way to keep people happy. Oh well. Will have to find someone else. I had a \"manager\" just call me after posting this review and after verifying everything including the last four of my SSN and it showed I had an account he said they had no control over their computer system and could not even manually enter anything into it to say I was a real person. REALLY? So now I'm going to freeze my credit and all because if you have NO control over what YOUR computers do, then who the hell know who has our information. I would add you probably don't want your \"managers\" calling people and telling them this, cause now going to have to wonder how many people were charged wrong, your computers screwed up paydays, or whatever, and customers were the ones holding the bag, when really it was your computers doing it cause you have no control over them, your employees words not mine. Like I said, had two loans no problems or issues until their computer could not verify me, or cause I had lack of credit. You called and talked to me, yet you could not verify who I am....LOL!! You have been warned people. Makes you wonder how many of these GOOD reviews are even real ones or just their computers generating them?!?!?! Now EVEN more scared since I did not apply again yesterday for a new loan or repeat loan and got this in my email this morning....November 19, 2019Dear kevin hays,Thank you for your recent application for a loan. Your request was carefully considered, and we regret that we are unable to approve your request.Reasons for Denial of CreditYour application was processed by a proprietary scoring system that assigns a numerical value to the various items of information we consider in evaluating an application. These numerical values are based upon the results of analyses of repayment histories of large numbers of customers.The reason(s) you did not score well compared with other applicants were:Unable to verify personal information or identity. Limited credit experience. Insufficient number of credit references. If you have any questions regarding this letter, you should contact us at:CashNetUSA Customer Support175 W. Jackson Blvd. Suite 1000Chicago, IL 60604Phone: (888) 801-9075Fax: (866) 413-3888And remember this is after having TWO loans with them back to back just recently all paid on time, yet they cant figure out who I am, and/or lack of credit.....Horrible.So now they called again and said I was lying about having loans with them, so here is the proof from THEIR OWN WEBSITE.

If you need cash quickly due to an unexpected emergency cost, then Cashnet USA should be a \"last resort\" resource.  Just know I have borrowed about $2500.00 from them in the last two years and I have no idea how long it will take to pay them off or how much money it will cost me.  This is scary because they set-up automatic payments every pay period for the MINIMUM balance.  Now if you only pay the minimum balance, there is a daily accrual rate (of an extremely miscellaneous set of numbers, etc 0.81917808 or whatever it is).  This means that if you do not pay MORE than your minimums, the daily accrual balance will continue to accumulate each day that your loan isn't paid off.  With any other loan (student, car, bank, etc, it tells you your principal amount every billing cycle, as well as the interest, so you know at any and all times  what is required to pay to payoff the loan).  With CashNet, there is absolutely NO WAY to tell if you are getting ripped off or not.  The customer service representatives cannot even calculate this for you.  It is very possible CashNet is stealing from their customers.  If you like not knowing exactly where all of your money is going, use Cashnet USA.  Otherwise, if you want to take out a reasonable loan to assist you during hard times, that you can pay off within the year, choose something else.  This company exploits those who aren't knowledgeable about budgeting, credit, or loans.  When I started working with them, I didn't know a thing about how to manage my money so it all sounded good and fine.  But now that I have done research and made plenty of money mistakes I wish that I never worked with them.  USE ONE MAIN FINANCIAL!  They will give you a payoff estimate and will allow you to borrow more money if needed in the event you pay off the original loan.",

The customer service representative was very friendly and professional.Be aware that the interest rate is higher than borrowing from a bank or finance company. Some people complain about the high interest rate when borrowing from CashNet USA,  but you have to remember that you are paying for the convenience of getting your money faster. There is no BANK or FINANCE COMPANY that will approve a loan application for you within 10 minutes.Will definitely do business with CashNet USA again if I’m in a situation requiring quick cash for an unexpected emergency.",

Fast forward to me needing to use their service again when an unexpected vehicle expense came up and I needed a little extra cash to get me through til payday less than 5 days away. Imagine my shock when I was declined for $100 loan (minimum amount) even though my circumstances have not changed at all since I was APPROVED the last time. Same job for the past 9 years, and no changes with my credit  (USAA monitors through Experian). I called and was not given a reason and that I would receive an email. The email stated 3 reasons 1. They couldn't verify my identity (What??) 2. Limited credit experience (Huh?} Over 10 yrs, apartment in my name, car payment in my name, /bills all in my name, Capital One MC (that I ended up having to use because of your denial) 3. Not enough credit references (Say What?) Refer to #2. I now use Earnin which allows you to borrow off your paycheck for a small loan. I prefer to use this instead of my Capital One credit card to avoid the interest.  No hassle and No credit BS. I have a large social media following and I will be telling all my followers on all my platforms about my horrible experience with your company. You have no loyalty to your customers!",

The loan is extremely easy to get but just as hard if not harder to pay off, when you make a payment your balance goes up instead of down. When called for payoff and address to send we were given a Dallas address (then according to customer service rep they send to Chicago so they can collect more fees) which is where we mailed payoff amount we were given. The check cleared our bank four days later but eight days later and our account has not been updated as a matter of fact we are told that account is past due and cash net attempted to pull a payment out of our bank account, we had to spend $32 to prevent it from being debited because it would have taken 10 to 14 days for a refund should payment have gone through.

But then she started acting better.  I paid back the full amount, $250, in several days.  For that, I got charged $45.  $8 of it is interest.  $37 of it is fees.

I only get paid once a month and sometimes, making money last that entire month isn’t easy. This school year, my child needed a Chromebook for school. Well, I found this out a week before school started and my monthly pay day was a week AFTER school started. So, I turned to CashnetUSA once again to help out. I applied for a $350 payday loan and within 3 hours, I had the money in my checking account! Holy moly! That was FAST; same day deposits are awesome! Thank you for being there for me when I needed just a little extra help. I have recommended CashNetUSA to my friends and family and will continue to do so. These guys are the real deal!!! For my customer loyalty, I get a 25% discount on my loan fees... they reward loyalty and I greatly appreciate it!",

I checked my account the next day and there was no deposit.  Come to find out they had the wrong account number in the system.  So I called customer service and tried to resolve the situation. Customer service was horrible. They seemed annoyed that I was trying to resolve the issue.On 7/8/19 I sent and a ACH direct deposit form with the correct account information and routing number. I was informed that I would have to wait until the transaction returned. After waiting a few more days I called my bank, and they said if I were to receive the transaction number from the lender, they could tell me if it had already been returned, but most likely it already had been. So, I called, and asked for the transaction number, needless to say I did not get it, but I got several reasons why they couldn't give it to me, and was told that they were looking into it and would let me know when they had resolved the issue. I never did receive an email or call letting me know they had resolved the issue. However they were nice enough to contact me on 7/21/19 too confirm payment on the advance I never recieved!  After telling them good luck on receiving payment with the wrong account information...they cancelled the payment ach as a \"courtesy\".Fast forward to yesterday, 9/12/19, when I decided to once again give them a chance to earn my business.  I requested a draw, and when I checked my account this morning, there was no deposit.   The reason?  THEY SENT IT TO THE SAME WRONG ACCOUNT NUMBER.  The inept fools never corrected the information I sent in back in July!!!I am beside my self at the ineptitude of these people, the complete lack of customer service, and the non-chalant attitude they have.  They are more than able to contact you too make sure they recieve their money...but they really could care less when the situation is reversed.  Needless to say, they will never get my business again...and I intend on posting this same review on every site possible to warm others to seek funding elsewhere...as well as to warn them of the complete stupidity of this business.",

I needed cash fast for medical reasons for my daughter. I will most definitely be informing my attorney if I’m stuck with having to make these payments.",

In less than 24 hrs from the moment I started the application, I had cash in hand! CashNetUSA was my \"safety net!\" The one aspect that could use improvement is (my) payments. Possibly an online amortization chart, allowing the customer to choose payment amounts which would then calculate how many payments are required to repay the line of credit off in full would make the process/experience perfect....although, from a business/profit standpoint showing the customer how much they will actually be paying back may cause pause, LOL! That would kinda cut your own throat I suppose but on the other hand, if money is needed, repayment amounts aren't significant in times of desperation & need. I suggest \"CashNetUSA\" use the \"Safety Net\" reference in advertising, if so, I'd like my advertising & marketing fee deposited directly into my bank account. 😉",

Make sure if you get a loan from this place you plan on paying it back ASAP! I can't stress that enough because the annual interest rate is 299% and it is accured daily. I have a payment that is processing on the 26 of July, but on the 25th of July they hit me with another interest charge of $183, making my next payment due in a couple of weeks of $270, on a loan of $1600 and now I owe over $2100.00.  This has now become a night mare for me just to bring the balance down so they won't hit you with the daily interest rate. All this is outlined in the agreement, but you really need to have a professional lawyer read over it. They take advantage of people to make sure that you are absolute sure before getting a loan from these people. I wish I never had.",
