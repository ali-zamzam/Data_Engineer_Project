Corey Brannon,The loan process and the communication with Jenny went smoothly. Jenny was very knowledgeable and answered all my questions either over the phone or in person. I would definitely try and encourage my friends and family too go visit this location and asked for Jenny. I will for sure see Jenny in the near future once this loan is paid off. On a side note. At this location the office setup is kinda weird sort of say. Once you enter the building everyone there just steer at you like vultures. This is just my observation. Thanks and God bless.,5
Jenicia Turner,"Extremely high interest rates. Extremely long process. My service rep was outstanding with great service. I have good credit & have used them in the past & paid off my loan early each time. I’m not bitter I was approved for the loan. However, I just wouldn’t recommend this company. Please save the time & money go elsewhere. You will pay double if not paid off early.",1
Tyler Wegmann,Company Loan specialist lied about conditions of loan and how interest is calculated into terms of the loan. Company has employees who do not know how to calculate interest on loans. Most ridiculous loan company. I cannot believe they are allowed to do business in our country. One Main should be banned from providing loans,1

A Veteran in Need,"The team in Hamilton, OH is extremely approachable and professional.  These gentlemen listened to me and what my needs were and provided care as well as assistance.  I can't thank them enough because customer service today has diminished. They deserve five stars and a batch of my Oatmeal, Chocolate-Chip cookies.",5
Robyn Bode,"If it wasn’t for the supervisor ( I’m sorry I forgot her name), I would’ve gone elsewhere. Ally left me completely ignored. I could not get ahold of anyone for help until I called my local OMF and they called for me. Once the supervisor got involved (and Ally out), it was a breeze! It was all done by the app.",4
Michelle ,It was so easy and convenient to process the loan online with the individual over the phone. It was a quick approval process. I thought I was going to have to go in to sign like the first time. Was very impressed with the ease of the process. Alicia the individual that helped me was very helpful.,5
Jocelyn Wagner,"I think it’s crazy you can’t review your signing documents on your own time before signing. I was on the phone with an agent while reading all the forms and she told me i had 51 min left. Then after i received my funds, i got an email that my application was declined, after i called in they says it was a duplicate i was never even aware of. Also every time you call in you verify your information with an agent then get transferred 3-4 times and have to verify all over again 3-4 times. Don’t understand why there are so many different numbers and departments. It’s a huge confusing web.",3
Heather Visser,"When trying to finalize my loan, I was told to click the link provided but there was no link. I had to call the person helping me get a loan to have her send me the link. That happened more than once. Being forced to only be able to send my paperwork needed through FedEx when living out where I live wasn't an option that I knew of. Thankfully they put a FedEx inside a dollar general close to where I do live. If not I would have had to drive over an hour to the closest one. My check not being delivered when it should have been. Thankfully I didn't need thar money right then and there.",2

Johanna Pagan,"While signing, I felt rushed. I wasn't given enough time to read all documents thoroughly, and when I downloaded them a few days later, they were no longer available. I could have reviewed the documents and signed them without assistance.",3
Elly,"I had a great experience with the lady working in Totowa while ago, but definitely don't start anything with Marcelo, he will make an appointment with you to just sign the approved loan and last minute he will call to tell you that the application was turned off. No sense. Talking about secured loan imagine",1
Michelle Lynch,The add on disability  insurance  is a fraud. You have to jump through fire rings. I was in a bad accident and the unnecessary  added stress was gross and unprofessional. Very very disappointed.,1

Toris L. Jones,"Do not, I repeat do not get a loan from this company. I was wondering why my loan amount was not going down till I looked at my receipt. on a loan of $8475, I make a payment of $247.84 and the receipt shows $2.14 went to principle and $245.70 went to interest. This should be against the law. I think I need to get an attorney. SMH",1
scolton,"Quality Customer ServiceMy homeowner's insurance was canceled due to my location in South Florida.  My agent found me another policy, but the price was doubled!  I paid for 2 inspections on my home and accepted that policy. 30 days later, it too was canceled due to needed roof repairs. One Main Financial assisted me in funding those roof repairs and my policy was reinstated in time for hurricane season!  Thank you One Main Financial!",5

Pedro Rodriguez Guerreo,"Although I was finally able to resolve my loan, I felt a little frustrated because the process was too complicated. I did not speak English, and although I asked to be served at another branch where they speak Spanish and on another occasion, I had already received a loan, they replied that it was not possible and on the phone only once did I have an interpreter to assist me. Similarly, on the day of signing the documents they told me, there would be someone who would interpret for me in Spanish to help me, but there was no interpreter. The person who assisted me on the day of the signing also told me that in the end, they would give me the printed loan documents, and to date, I do not have them.I have always received good attention from OneMain, this is the first time that these setbacks have happened to me.",4

Alicia,"The lady that was working on my application the first time was rude. She would hang up really fast, she questioned me like I was a child. She just wasn’t helpful at all. Her name is Veronica. The manager Jerome called me back and finished my application and was very helpful. He did explain they was short handed and had new staff trying to explain why Veronica was rushing and not very helpful. But that is no excuse of how she treated me",1
Brian Maier,"Danell from the 6mile store in Livonia, MI  was awesome to work with.  She was responsive, energetic, honest and most importantly, understanding.  I really felt like she was there to help, not to judge my situation.  She made me comfortable, explained all my options and gave me time to decide what was right for me.  She respected my time and just made it easy to do business with OneMain. I felt like I was her only customer every time I interacted with her.  She picked up the phone and greeted me by name before I even said a word!  Outstanding customer service, outstanding product offering, outstanding OneMain. Thank you.",5
customer,They listen to the problem they gave me a choice of how to do the loan that will be the best for me.,5
JB,"Bunch of crooks this place is. Told them i was selling my car and got the payoff monday. Told them i would be in wednesday to sell the car. The customer could not make it wednesday and switched to friday due to an emergency he had. In 3 days my payoff went up mysteriously $200.00? Supposedly this ""company"" helps people with bad credit, but in the end you get the shaft.Edit: typical. Provided my waste of time information and no response. Lets see what the BBB has to say about this corrupt corp.",1

Laura Hawkins,"I am unhappy to say the least about my last loan I opened at the end of April of this year in South Zanesville, worked with April.  Thought, let's give this a shot, I have been a customer for a while, having multiple loans in the past that I have paid in full and off way before the end of the loan.  I decided to stay local bc hey, why not.  Was trying to get a loan for 8-9000 for a car, but kept getting run around that we needed to go higher on the loan - newer car , fewer miles, etc. etc.  So was told I was approved for 13000.  Again, stayed local, biggest mistake ever- Went to Finks , thought we found a car that met our criteria,  and got the run around again, needed to come up with 2000 down payment which we weren't expecting to do.  We had to do what we had to do to make it work, needed a vehicle to get back and forth to work .  Needless to say, when filling out the terms and conditions, wasn't explained the ""optional""   insurance that was added to my account , just scanned over and told to select the other box.  I ended up calling to get that ""optional"" insurance removed and was refunded for that portion of it, which was a joke.  2 weeks later after getting the car, had to repair the car due to spark plugs misfiring and not driving.  Replaced all 4 and brakes, also oil change- Finks is terrible and doesn’t make sure you are driving off the lot with a maintained vehicle.  They don’t care as long as they get their money.  Absolutely not the way to treat people.  So almost $2500 in the hole in the middle of May from buying the vehicle end of April, and not even had it a month.  Thought issue was fixed, engine light repeated came on, burning oil.  Taken to 2 different mechanics before they recommend to take it to dealer.  Where the dealer charged us over $300 to do a diagnostic test that led to them saying the engine needed rebuilt and undrivable .  Which with a straight face said it would cost $7500 to complete.  Had car towed back home where the car sat on our lot for 2 months, making payments and insurance payments on a vehicle that doesn’t run properly.  Reached out for help to try and get loan to atleast get car back on the road again and denied over and over, was told not much we can do since I just opened loan.  SMH.  Not willing to help secure an asset and get customer back on the road, I canceled the insurance on it and stopped payments on vehicle until we could figure out what to do.  I then receive phone calls and letters stating I am being charged 1200 onto loan bc I canceled insurance.  What a joke.  I ended up voluntarily giving up the vehicle and have picked up by you guys bc I am not paying for something that one, doesn’t drive, two, a company that wouldn’t help with getting the asset working and looking out for customers.  The phone calls I am receiving about a insurance claim, I don’t know what to tell you, I haven’t had insurance on that car since July, you should know since I am being charged for it.  I actually went with a company that values me as a consumer and will help if something ever happens to the car.  I have forfeited the joke of a car back to you guys.  You have it.  I am done with this company and will never do business again here, and never recommend to anyone.  Worst customer service I have dealt with.  I am aware of the affects to my credit with the repo on there, but you guys left me  no choice.  If there is a claim on the car, good luck bc I never filed anything, it is probably for the engine that needs repaired.  Maybe you should reach out to Finks for that.  Oh wait, it was as is sold, so their hands are clean.  Absolutely terrible customer experience all around.   LAE",5

We made some financial mistakes a long time ago when were a lot younger but now are very financially responsible. We have two cars paid off and this is our first loan. We also always make payments on time or early so we appreciate One Main giving us a chance! Other loan companies will continue to miss out on business because they only look for a perfect credit scores instead of income to debt ratio, on time payments, assets (2 cars paid off), good credit scores, etc",5

Louis G,SCAM alert! Horrible experience I was looking into a personal loan for myself and somehow they decided to run my mothers social security number and majorly effect here credit score with a hard inquiry. I don’t know how they even got her social security number. They are refusing to give me or my mother a copy of application to show her social was never provided since I don’t know it. They are rude once called out on there scams. They just hang up on you and refuse to provide a copy of application which to me is very sketchy. Do not put any information into there site because they somehow will get access to your whole family and start hitting there accounts effect everyone’s credit score and then when you try to get the information from them they refuse and just hang up. Do not use this company all they care about is making commissions off of successfully completing a loan. Make a credit karma account and go through them they keep all your info safe. This place is just collecting info and socials on whoever they can and won’t help you when trying to figure it out. Again I urgently advice you not to use this company,5
Shawn Lavette,I have a loan with one main. I also have unemployment insurance on the loan. I have filled out their paperwork twice and they’re ignoring me and not calling me back. No feedback .

Susan Sosnowy,"In Aug 2022 The Car that I had my secured loan on was totaled. My insurance paid One Main the book Vsalue which left a balance. I spoke with a Representative shortly afterwards - Requesting a modification to my payments because I had to go to another bank for a car loan. OneMain turned me down. At the same time - My income was reduced by the VA. Im in an appeal stage with them but it has caused me an extreme hardship. I am requesting any immediate financial help that you can provide please. I am a disabled veteran. In Sept 2022 the VA stopped my disability for an error in my account - Stating they weren't informed 10 years ago that I was divorced. So they say they were paying me at the married rate, which came to a total of $75,000 for 10 nearing 15 years. I just recently was awarded my 40% Rating and just a few months later - They took my entire check. This is causing extreme hardships with me because I am unable to pay some of my bills creating a credit problem to name one set of circumstances.  Please understand that my phone was destroyed in the car accident and I have been without a phone. I found an old one and installed my chip which enabled my Previous Phone number to work. My phone is attacked daily by too many spam calls. (910)782-7871 is my number. I need a link to upload my current Benefit Letter to you which would prove that I am in a bad position since OneMain wouldn't approve a car loan for me.

They have called just to check to see if I was ok, not just when the bill was due. They have NEVER judged me! 2020-2022 have given me EVERY emergency there is from my siblings sudden death to needing a new car engine and roof on my home. I was never told no, ALWAYS let’s see what we can do to help. The reps have GENUINE concern and care when trying to help. They listen to your heart not just your voice. I have LITERALLY cried trying to explain my situation with more than one rep. I could tell they were not faking their sympathy for me and my family. If I could put my home mortgage and every extended credit I have with them I would! Never have a had a bad experience in the 8 years I have been with them. I recommend to all my family and friends. I am grateful that my Aunt recommended them to me.",5

Steve,"Used loan services multiple times. Always from the Antioch,CA office where a month ago everyone in the office was chill, laid back and easy to work with - like always have been over the years... But when we came in two weeks ago all the employees were wearing different clothes and looked uncomfortable which made us and the whole entire experience uptight and uncomfortable, my partner and I are writing this review to say THANK YOU! to the manager who made the switch back to the blue jeans and polo shirts that made us, the customer, and obviously the whole staff, much more comfortable and the whole environment more inviting. We even went to another office and everyone was all wearing blue jeans. Thank you for keeping it casual and comfortable. We never felt like there was a dress code. Made us feel all out of place. Plus we'll take our services to a bank if we want to see people hating what they're wearing and trying to smile.I tell you, I almost lost confidence in OMF over the unusual shift of atmosphere. Maybe darker blue jeans and red polos if we had any suggestions, just not what it was if there's got to be a change. Ty",5

MHH,The representative that worked with my loan was great but the other day another one of your representatives named Vance was very rude and arrogant about a question I had. I called Sept 20 and it’s 2 days later and no response so I’m actually looking into another lender to see about a loan to pay you guys off. I’ve been doing business with your business off and on the last 15 years with no issues but after this I’m pretty much done and tomorrow the 23rd it will be officially 3 weeks we my issue and 3 days and still no answers from Vance I don’t expect him to call me back to give me an answer.,5

Valued Customer,"I'm so over this company.  A couple years ago I was sent a pre-approved offer in the mail for this company which of course turned out not to be the case.  Most recently, I have been flooded with offers from this company and Credit Karma has them pop up every single time I log on.  I went ahead with the prequalification process and was offered an unsecured loan of $3,000 but when I followed through to complete the loan process (which I did very carefully and after much consideration), I immediately received a pop up that I was approved for a $7,000 SECURED loan.  Really OneMain?  I asked for a $3,000 unsecured loan. I know prequalifying isn't guaranteed but you offered several loans and none required collateral.  I wish I had known because now my credit is hit hard and my score will go down and it will be for absolutely nothing.  I reached out to customer service who told me that nothing is guaranteed. Well, yeah, I know that but seriously I feel like this seems like a classic case of getting me to follow through with the application so that I can be persauded to take out a much higher secured loan.  My credit score isn't that bad and my financial situation isn't that bad so I find it rather odd that a company that advertises they help those with lower credit scores get loans.  I mean seriously, all I wanted to borrow was $3,000 and I believe you guys take $500 of the loan as an origination fee.  I simply wanted to improve my credit score and use the money to pay down a few of my cards but instead my score will go down. Thanks for nothing OneMain. I won't be tricked again.",5

Carlos Latimer Vargas,"A joke. They were stringing us along the process of approval for 2 weeks. Our account manager Jaleal was extremely unprofessional , and NEVER followed up with us or answered phone calls. Worst part was we were told that everything was good to go for finalization of the loan, our bank account information was even taken. Soon after complaining about our account manager, and that we would like someone new - magically we were no longer able to get a loan. With ZERO explanation. There are a lot of positive reviews here, but sometimes the good does NOT out weigh the bad. Don’t waste your time. It’s not worth it !",5

Carol McFalls,"When I tell you I’m sick and tired of this company playing with my mind especially in probably the most difficult time in my life I’ll ever be going through, I mean it. Not all of us asks to be in a financial crisis purposely. And I’ve emailed, called, and spoke to these people NUMEROUS and I mean NUMEROUS of times about sending me notifications telling me how “before we couldn’t help but now we can” only to be rejected over and over and over again has gotten me to the point where I’m so fed up with these lies that I’m going to bring it to the attention of my attorney. They reject, they ignore, and when they get in touch with me they tell me they’ll take me off the list, can’t change outcomes of approval, and they’re sorry. BULLCRAP. They kindly mislead, mock, and laugh at me time and time again. Now I’m sure that someone is going to try to contact me, again, to tell me nothing but I’m sorry and we can’t change the outcome and we won’t notify you again only to do it AGAIN. Well, I’ve had just enough of these games. It may be a long run but it’s a long run I’m willing to take once I show and prove all these misleading and unnecessary games to my lawyer which in fact is already aware on this situation. I’VE HAD ENOUGH.",5

Having lost my husband recently, I went from two incomes to one.  As if that wasn't traumatic enough, I had major surgery this past year and was out of work for nearly 4mths; hence the credit card debt.  This is a second chance to get caught-up, an alternative to Bankruptcy, and the ability to maintain my Credit Score.  The representative that assisted me (Ryan S.) was so professional and compassionate. He took the time explaining my options, helped me to complete my application, and searched for lenders. He guided me  every step-of-the-way.  I was approved and monies were in my checking account in 24 hrs. I couldn't have asked for better service. Thank you!",5

Melissa Eriksen,I APPLIED FOR 2 LOANS TOTALING $3000.00 DOLLARS TO GET MYSELF OUT OF CREDIT CARD DEBIT..MY MONTHLY PAYMENT AVERAGED $120.00 UP TO $150.00 OVER A 3 YEAR TIME SPAND. WHENEVER I CALLED TO SEE IF I COULD APPLY MORE MONEY TO THE LOAN TO PAY IT OFF I WAS TOLD TO COME INTO THE OFFICE TO DO THAT NOT ONLINE. ONCE YOU DO GO INTO THE OFFICE THEY TRY AND SELL U MORE PRODUCTS LIKE LIFE INSURANE ETC TO MAKE YOUR PAYMENT EVEN HIGHER SO I NEVER WENT BACK IN. I RECEIVED COUNTLESS PHONECALLS ASKING IF I NEEDED MORE MONEY ATLEAST 2-3 TIMES A WEEK TO WHICH I BLOCKED ONE MAIN FINANCIAL PHONE CALLS ENTIRELY. WITH THE ONSET OF COVID19 AND LOSS OF WORK I DEFAULTED ON MY LOAN PAYMENTS...I AM NOW BEING SUED FOR $2300.00 OF 3000.00 LOAN THAT I MADE MONTHLY PAYMENTS ON FOR 3 YEARS????? MY QUESTIONS IS HOW IS THE BALANCE ON LOAN THIS HIGH STILL??? DID ALL OF MY PAYMENT GO THE INTEREST AND NOT THE LOAN..I FEEL AS THOUGH IN THE 3 YEARS OF MAKING PAYMENTS OF $120.00 A MONTH THE BALANCE WOULD BE LOWER..+IN MY OPNINON ONE MAIN IS PREDITORY AND I WILL SEE YOU IN COURT.,5
William Meuret Jr,Horrible experience. I honestly believed I was racially profiled. I gave them several documents that they needed and nothing was ever enough.

Submitted all my info online, then 5 days later got a call to review the information I had submitted and was offered $X,XXX (MUCH less that the email offer). Then it dropped even more after the ""verified my income"" in some very weird convoluted way. Ended up getting about 85% LESS that the teaser said! Also the rep got VERY rude with some very sarcastic comments when I refused their extra products that nearly doubled my payment.",5

I used to be able to switch my due date, or even pay a month ahead~ I can still do those things, BUT they will still debit your checking account on the due date, bounce the rest of your bill payments and NOT paying the bank fees. This is September 2022, and they have double dipped into my checking account. I just received “sorry”. Sorry doesn’t put my diabetic meds in my cabinet. Sorry doesn’t doesn’t feed my elderly sick cat. Sorry doesn’t put gas in my tank to make doctor visits. Terrible people with no compassion. Steer clear of this company. Especially the Brooklawn NJ office. Deceitful.",5

The person I worked with was very friendly, but I feel like she was trying to ""dupe"" me into the extra products.  Unfortunate.",5

I barely received any communications from Shannon and even received an email regarding closing when we hadn’t even discussed the actual loan that I wanted! I also left a message at the branch and never got a call back. In the end I got the loan I needed but left the branch with an uneasy feeling. Shannon didn’t even ask to see my ID before we got started with the closing. Good thing I was who I said I was or someone else could have signed for my loan. I chose to work with One Main based on my past experiences, but I will be more cautious the next time.",5
Terri Moore,Lucy was very helpful in obtaining a loan for us. The whole process went very smoothly.,5
Johnny Carlton,"When I went to for the closing, after signing almost all of the documents, I was told that I could not pay down the principal.  That if I paid extra each month, it would go directly to the interest.  This is very unethical business practices.  If I didn't need this vehicle so bad for my disabled son, I would have walked out.  What kills me is that I KNOW I could have gotten a loan with a more reputable company but due to time constraints, I could not.  I hate OneMain Financial!  I can't wait to get refinance loan to get out of your clutches.  Bad business!!I understand what you're saying, I GET IT!  BUT if I pay off this loan that way, I'll be paying DOUBLE what I borrowed.

Charlie Martin Jr,"Was some rude, had little interest in my needs, I. Did not want home and auto  coverage and that’s what she pushed the whole time, must have pushed it 10-12 times, even put it in the cost, I actually could have gotten more money when she took off the cost of the home and auto.

Howard Henderson Jr,"One Main Financial has put multiple hard inquires on my credit report dinging me for a good bit of points.  They claim that they get inquiries from anonymous and other partner companies which they do the inquiry for.    Its been multiple times and now another shows up on my credit report for a loan they have no record of, but wont remove from my report and say I have to file a claim with the credit agencies.    When In fact, they know if they do that they admit to the error and therefore wont do it even if they have impacted your life and your business in a negative way.    Most other companies will remove it immediatly and call the financial credit agencies and talk to them directly so it can be immediatly removed.    Not for them...     If you even get a letter from them, dont look it...  Just burn it and throw it away or it may end up hurting you and your family.",5

Ixander Soto Leon,They kept sending me mails encouraging me to apply for a easy approval loan. When I finally applied the woman said I was denied a loan because I didn't have any Collateral.  I had fair Credit before I applied. They did an Hard Inquiry and that resulted in points falling off my Credit causing it to be Bad Credit. DONT APPLY IF YOU DONT HAVE ANY COLLATERAL. YOU WILL BE DENIED AND YOUR CREDIT SCORE WILL DROP.I Regretted applying and would advise against it. There are many alternatives that are way better. They messed up my Credit so I have to wait two years for that Hard inquiry to disappear off my Credit Report. I am trying to repair my damaged Credit. I am NOT interested in applying to One Main Financial EVER AGAIN. I DONT RECOMMEND IT. DONT WASTE TOUR TIME PEOPLE. APPLY AT YOUR OWN RISK.,1

Keli Butler,"This was a long drawn out process, I went through an online app, then a representative called me and we went though the application variable again.  I had another local rep contact me told me I was approved for 9300.00 at 31% I asked for 7500.  I did not find out until the very last moment they wanted my car title.  This is essentially a car title place which are a dime a dozen. I could have walked into one of them put down my car title and walked out. So much time wasted.  I have good credit great income, the loan is only to help establish better credit. I always pay cash and do not use credit. However for a home loan like to see credit is used.  That is the catch, interest.  Felt scammed.  The response does NOT address the issues I mentioned in my initial review.  I was NOT told this was similar to a title loan this was told at the very end of the process when your rep was trying to get me to accept the terms.  The interest rate is high as I got the same loan at 10.99 vs your 31.00 %. I could only borrow up to 7500 from them thus I was referred to One Main by Expedia.  Your company approved my loan based on my credit score but wanted my car as collateral.  This should be mentioned well before having anyone apply as a hard inquiry is conducted on a credit report thus lowering your score.  I would have never authorized a credit check if the pratice of not full disclosure of having a personal vehicle of collateral was mentioned.  This is deceitful and I do plan on disputing the inquiry based on the failure to be transparent and fully disclose the terms.  My FICO score is important to me. Your company seems to be another type of exploiting consumers.  I am not that one. I have good credit plan to keep it good.  I suggest you inform customers before they apply and take a hit on their credit.  I believe the FCRA applies to this issue and an Federal Trade Complaint is forth coming.  Please honest be transparent and mention all stipulations.  You failed here.",5

Rep put me on hold for 30 minutes came back and said he would call me back and we can pick up where we left off. Well finally got a call back an hour later with a completely different rep and had to go thru the whole process again from the beginning.  A seamless process turned into a 5 hour ordeal on a Saturday.  Had excellent service from the dealership until the phone calls went array with OneMain.  Finally got everything handled but I didn't feel good about the final numbers because everyhing was so screwed up.,5

Sandra Traggiai,"I have been getting pestered by Onemain for over 1 year. So I was at a point where I needed to get some funds to tide me over until my Heloc loan in January 2023. I supplied them with bank information, documents and ID etc.. Received a call saying I was qualitied for $8600. They asked that I send further documentation and did two ""Hard Pulls"" on my credit. I supplied them with my most recent tax returns-2020, bank statements for 6 months, brokerage account information etc. Then they asked that I prove that my 2021 tax return had been processed. It had been submitted to the IRS April  2022 but has still not shown as processed. I sent a duplicate to the IRS last month. The IRS has informed me they are months behind for paper returns- it can take between 6-9 months. I had proof both were sent along with TaxAct documentation.  BTW- how can a company only use process-same year returns with the IRS in the rears? I offered to get them a copy from Tax Act etc.. then I was told that I would only qualify for $3000 which included a lien on my Suburban! Waste of time.. Very high interest rates! Untruthful and untrustworthy. After response: The loan agent already had pulled my credit and advised me I was eligible for the $8600 prior to jumping through the next 2 days of hoops. Do not trust them! Waste fo time and hard pulls from two different bureau's.",5

A couple of days went by and so I called again, and was once again told someone would reach out to me. No one did and so I called again and the machine, not even a person. The machine told me I could not be approved at this time. My time was wasted and I was mislead.",5
Darrin Tabor,Everything was really professionally done and the staff was really very respectful and courteous and I would certainly refer as many people as possible....thank you ...very satisfied customer!!,5
James Rogers,I applied for a loan at OneMain. They kept insisting I use my truck for collateral and about 5 times I told them NO! At no time beyond that was my truck mentioned again. I then applied for a second emergency loan. Again they wanted me to get a larger loan and use my truck. Again I said emphatically NO about another 5 or 6 times. Again heard nothing after that about my truck. A couple of days ago I received a letter from my bank saying that OneMain had put themselves on my loan as lean holder!!!! I was pissed! I called OneMain they told me that I had signed the paperwork that stated I gave them permission to do so. I am currently looking for a fraud attorney because I gave no authorization for them to do so. I am going to sue them for all their worth!!!!! This is total fraud!!!!! Do not use this company!!!!!,5

Alicia Roseboro,I am very disappointed about OneMain financial institution because even though my credit was 698 almost a 700 score my interest rate was to high I know with that credit score I could get a better interest rate with another financial institution specially after doing a couple of loans. That I paid off on time with this company.  Sincerely I give this company a 3 from ten. I Will never do business with this company again I will let friends and family know.,5

The direct deposit of funds did not go through when agreed to. (now what). Assistant states that the people who perform direct deposit state bank will not take the deposit and they don't know why. At 36% interest rate for this loan, PICK UP THE PHONE AND CALL THE BANK!!! What is going on that a customer cannot get the courtesy to make it work?",5

Liza Bets,"If it wasn't for such a wonderful closer (Tracy), I would have given  One Main Financial a one star. The problem is not the people who worked directly with me, it is the long drawn out process that doesn't take any consideration for a person's time.  Spending an evening with the auto sales people waiting for a completion of an already approved loan,  when I should have been home sleeping for my nighttime job is my top major complaint.  I don't necessarily recommend people not to use One Main, just be aware of the lack of consideration of their time and needs.",4

Randell Tober,"The process to get the paperwork completed is truly unacceptable.  Over two hours worth of waiting.  Got rate wrong, was first told I was required to buy a service plan then during closing loan said wasn't required.  Only to then find out this wasn't a auto loan but a personal loan with automobile being collateral. Worst experience I have ever had purchasing a car.

Josephine Hidalgo,Andrew was a great help and explained everything to me,5
Fannie Williams,Best customer service ever I will never do business anywhere else,5
Ruth Russell,The service was great up until it was time to finalize. The lack of checking the paperwork prior to signing has been frustrating. I’ve been divorced from my ex husband and I’ve received calls after the fact that the dates were incorrect etc. makes it very hard because these are all things that should’ve been done before signing.,5
Deborah Thompson,Always a good experience working with everyone in the office. Always willing to help as best as can.,5
Anonymous,They were super friendly and answered any questions or concerns within a timely manner. I started the process on a Monday and we were finished that Friday with everything in place. Recommended to anyone!!!!,5
Ondie,"Do not waste your time with this crooks, they will just your credit score and waste time. I kept getting junks of spam mail from these guys about a « guaranteed loans » and even after they wasted my time through the entire application process and meeting all the required documents they needed, they will reject you. Very rude and un professionnal staff with complete bad work ethics to mislead clients into a sham.",5
Troy Privatsky,"The staff at the Greenway Branch are always ready and willing to help! We always receive exceptionally great service by in-branch or by phone. They recently helped us get a ""fresh start"" on our loan due to the increase in gas, food, and rent per month. We appreciated the help.",5
Bruce Atkinson,"My very 1st experience was great but unfortunately the representative I got this time was very unprofessional. She seemed very scattered and kept forgetting to tell me items I would need throughout my application ( a check list would be helpful for futureapplicants). She left me a voicemail I had to listen to 5 times at minimum. The message was unclear and she spoke very fast not being able to understand (giving a name and call back # A LITTLE SLOWER gives the applicant a chance to write down what you are asking). For my appointment She constantly jumped around  from client to client, putting my presents on the back burner. As she finally got to my application she completely spaced out and I had to catch her up on the information I had already sent her. Unfortunately I could not understand much of what she was telling me. I could tell speaking English wasn't too easy, I finally just asked her to just speak to me in Spanish, and at least that part was a little better.",5
Eleanor Watson,Paulette was amazing!  So grateful for her and everything she did.   Thank you!,5

Cerise Fluer,The customer service is unbelievably rude at the Augusta Ga office on Wrightsboro Rd. They Also charged my card without my authorization so I asked them return my money asap. The manager said t would be 3 to 5 business days so I’m still waiting. The manager was extremely mean and nasty with No Reguards to my situation or feelings. I’ve been a long time customer due to a large loan and high interest rates. Normally after being a long time customer they would allow you to refinance at a much better rate. Ive paid my loan down significantly and they still refuse to give me a decent rate. After paying them off I will never use them again and I would advise anyone seeking a loan to definitely bypass one Main financial! They care nothing about their customers.,5
Sharon R,Very quick and Tia was very good at her job,5
The Script Keepers,Went quicker them expected.  Was treated very well.  Money was deposited super fast.  Everything was well explained.  Multiple options were given,5
Alice,They don't let you leave a bad review.  They are useless. Uploaded docs for weeks to be turned down. They lie and don't help people who really need it,5

Mary McFarlanf,"I was going to borrow $1,500 but one of the reps suggested I get enough to pay off my $ 4000 in credit card debt. I had an outstanding loan already with OneMain that was paid off and I was given $6000. The rep that handled my loan was so nice and helpful. I fell bad that I don’t remember his name as he was so nice and kind and helpful. I’ve never had a issue with One Main and the payments are reasonable and I can pay ever 2 weeks to make it even easier. I’ve recommended One Main to family and friends. Thanks for being a honest and up front loan company. Leslie R",5

amy 4living,"I have tried , for months now, to work with them, I have had unfortunately the worst luck in life, escaped dv, lost my home, and then my job, literally was sleeping in my car with my son, and they were aware of it all... I tried to keep up with payments, but regardless of my situation they only care about the money... also the calls, I have 3 numbers calling from OMF 11 missed calls  43 from another number, 86 missed from the main branch...all within under a month... what can I even do? I don't even know how we're going to eat tomorrow let alone pay anything without any sort of income coming in or housing...",5
Victoria Vela,They were honest and kind also very helpful.,5
Heather,Applied for Loan. Received a phone call Monday morning with an approval. Submitted documents. From Monday to Wednesday I sent countless documents at their request. On Tuesday we were supposed to sign the loan documents but something happened. I knew something was up from that moment on. The women I had been dealing with stopped being responsive. I reached out and was promised a call back. The call back was to tell me that I went from signing for my loan to being declined the loan because my phone number verified as my daughters and sons phone  instead of myself which if it was a stranger I would be alarmed but of course my phone number would be associated with my own children. So basically I spent 3 days sharing all my personal information with this company to be turned away by a systematic decision. In the end this gave me payday loan vibes. Had I been dealing with a real financial institution I wouldn’t have been denied over a mismatch phone number. My income etc all check out but your number says it’s affiliated with your kids so no. I recommend this to no one and will be locking my credit for a while until I figure out if I got scammed or not,4
Iesha Harvin,"Except for the incredibly high interest rate, things went smooth. I haven't missed a payment in 4 years. Some slack with a lower interest rate would be nice.",5
Penny Purser,Very good professional experience and timely manner,2
Cobina Lartson,"Had a pleasant experience with our sales associate Miss Cruz, she reached out to us after numerous calls to OneMain",5
Linda Denison,"I receive a notice telling me  that I was able to get a $6000 loan, because I was loyal customer. After checking the loan I was only able to get $2800. It was fine when I got the loan, but what I was going to use the money for was to pay off my credit cards off. With the cards paid off it would have made easier to make payments for other bills. Thank you for the loan Doug Lowery",5
Rhonda L Nelson,Always a joy working with this team. Will always a work with them in the future and refer them to any of my family and friends,5
"Randi-West End,NC",I filled out a loan application because they said that it wouldn't affect my credit but due to the hard inquiry that they did  I'm unable to receive the loan that I did get from another company I was told that I needed a letter of declaration stating that nothing transpired from that hard inquiry from them and they said that's something that they don't do that I have to dispute it through the credit bureau the credit bureaus told me that it takes 2 years for it to come off if I do it that way I will never again ever deal with this company.,5

Bryant Eury,Getting a loan was fast and easy the person who represented me was mrs.martin she was really sweet kind and worked things out to where I could understand her..,5
Beata Pickens,"this process was not very easy or enjoyable. I had 4 days of processing. The loan officer was polite but was not in sync with the other departments. I was told that my loan was secured but after I confirmed it with the customer care, it was not confirmed in their system. I was told that the title to my car from the previous loan would be returned...after 30 days. I was told that i would have my credit cards paid, and it has been 14 days and they still have not been paid. I now have additional fees to pay on the cards because the payments have not been paid. I wanted to consolidate my loans to one loan and I am happy to get the loan, it was not a pleasurable experience and I still have remaining balances and fees that I shouldnt have, and I have to wait for 30 days to get a response from the DMV...to tell me if they re;leased the lien. I am positive that this will take much longer because of the uncoordinated response from this company.",5
Juanita Beach,A no nonsense lender they are honest and upfront with you and very professional i would recommend them to a friend as a matter of fact i already did. And I'm sure he will have the same outcome as well. One Main Financial you simply can't go wrong,5

And I love that the loan can be paid early, with no penalties. I have a low credit score, due in part to not having enough credit and had been denied by so many, that I almost gave up hope, until now. I highly recommend OneMain Financial if you are looking to build credit.",5

John ,"Although I appreciate your collaboration I think there are things to improve, from the moment I submit my online application I was never called to follow up on my application. Only more than a week later I had to go to the nearest office of One Main Financial and there I was put in telephone contact with Danisha who advised me during my process. However, I received an email, then another and then another with more and more requirements than they needed to study my application instead of sending a single one with everything they needed in such a way that one can prepare and send it all together from the beginning. Finally after two weeks and having to be the one who took the initiative to call and follow up on my request they finally made the transfer to my bank account. I am concerned that a direct payment is still pending that you were left to make to Oportun with whom I had a loan and that payment has not been made and they are charging me days of delay when it was assumed that One Main Financial would make the payment the same day that they made the transfer to me. Thank you",5

earl landryiii,"I started out speaking with Rebecca who you could tell was a newer employee as she was very timid on the phone.  Given this wasn't my first experience with One Main, I expected a smooth transaction as I had before.  I spoke to her on Monday and never received a call back from her or anyone at the Scarborough branch.  I called several times and left messages but no replies.  I called the Augusta branch Wednesday as I just wanted to find out what was going on and they told me they could see approval options in the system and I should call back the Scarborough office after 4:30 and perhaps someone would answer.  After being left hanging for 2 days with no return calls from anyone in the office, I completed the transaction with Derrick who mentioned Rebecca was no longer with them.  Apparently no one listens to the messages in the general mailbox.  This is generally a smooth process but perhaps the lack of employees hindered the great service I had in the past.  Both Derrick and Tony who assisted me with signing the closing documents were knowledgeable and made up for the lack of service I received from Rebecca.",5

Edwin S.,"The office is understaffed and slow to follow up. The employees I have spoken with have been inpatient in the sense of rushing me or telling me they have other clients waiting. Unfortunately, other clients is not my concern or need to know. The employee Jerome shows that his  customer service isn’t important and could care less how the customer receives it. The team over promised and undelivered on several occasions of me calling and didn’t seem to care because they claim they are so busy. Being busy does not excuse poor customer service.",5

Clarissa Athanaze,OneMain Financial did an excellent job in securing my loan. The only problem I had was receiving a paper check instead of a direct deposit.

Sarah Moreno,"Went to the Hope Mills location off Main Street. on a Friday (8/5/22). Arrived at 4:45pm two ladies were working. One was on the phone the other was pretending to do something in the computer. NO ONE else was in the building and it took them 10 minutes to even acknowledge me. The lady said they were busy and couldn’t help me. I told her it was only 4:55pm and their hours are clearly state they close at 5:30pm, and she began to cut me off and rudely say they have others things to do and could not help me. Worse banking/financial institution experience ever!",5
Jerilu Goetzman,You can have good credit and they still give you a hard time. Never again,5
Rene Scott,"I spent too much time back and forth with Will trying to get this loan established.  We finally set up the date and time to finalize my documents via the computer so I didn't have to leave work.  He never called, I had to call him and then he said he thought I was coming into the office, when that was not discussed so he was not prepared for the signing and I had to waste time while he got things set up and he was not very knowledgeable on how to set it up as he had to put me on hold to find out how to do it.  I went through the docs with him and instead of using my existing account to deposit the money he told me I had to use my debit card and the money did not get deposited because the bank doesn't accept deposits from credit cards, so I had to leave work anyway early to go pick up the check deposit it and wait two extra days to get the funds when I made it clear that I needed them as soon as I could to Will.  When I received the call that I needed to come and pick up a check,  I asked why he didn't use my existing bank account routing info since that is how they get the payment now and the girl I spoke with said he should have given me the option, which he didn't.  I have never had issues with getting a loan from you but this time was extremely frustrating.",5

Elaine Babin,"I applied for a secured loan. Sent them all the requested documents they asked for. I spent $75.00 faxing over my tax return at Office Depot, which they asked me to do because the file was too large to upload. They led me to believe up until the final underwriting that everything look great and even scheduled me an appointment to come in and sign the loan agreement. An hour before my appointment, I was told I was denied because there was a discrepancy between my tax return and IRS tax transcripts. How can this be? I got my tax return from H&R Block which was accepted by the IRS and my tax transcripts directly from the IRS website. I offered to log on and retrieve these documents from their office, in front of them. How can there be a discrepancy? The local branch put in a complaint for me and said I would receive a call from the Customer Care department, which I did the following week. I was then told there is nothing they can do and I will get a letter in the mail which will have a number I can call. She did not address my issue, just an automated response. I thought this was the resolution department? This customer service employee stated she did not even look into this. This experience has been aggravating and caused me a hit on my credit, a waste of weeks of my time, and a cost of $75 out of my pocket. I got nowhere and was denied of no fault of my own.",5

Catherine,"9 months ago, I was in desperate to find a loan to help me consolidate all my bills into one. No one wouldn’t approve because of my score being low or what was showing on my credit report. When I saw OneMain financial, I decided to give it one last chance. They approved!!! Lisa worked with me and explained everything in detail to what I would like in case of emergencies down the future and so forth. After 9 months of paying my loan on time, I asked to refinance my loan and maybe take out some extra cash. Again, I was approved and my interest rate has dropped so much!!! Thank you again, especially to Lisa for helping me out!!! I am now not stressing out with my bills no more and have been saving up!",3

I asked why everyone has on a mask know one lady said “because your wife has Covid-19 “ I said NO she doesn’t. And so I asked what is my wife’s name she said I don’t know !

Belinda Amwake,"I worked with one main previously and had great success but in this case the local branch was never available and when they were available they’d leave a message at the end of the day and you could never reach anyone back. I went through corporate and had to tell my story every single time over and over again, same documents requested over ahd over again. Dealt with at least a dozen people, took them nearly 3 weeks after them sending a payoff check to the wrong place and rectify the situation. All the while while I was accruing interest in paying additional fees. Not happy about this experience.",1

Sara Ruffin,"The entire loan process was pretty easy and uneventful. Although I understand the process here, the whole last name confusion part was a tad bit aggravating especially since I tried to head off any confusion by bringing in documents that should have quickly answered questions. Other than that, it was a good experience and the reason I came back to OneMain was the good experience I had with my previous loan with them. Oh, one comment here. I wish someone that told me the office moved. The new location, once we found it - was more difficult for me to navigate to get into with my disability. Although there are handicapped spaces, there was no curb ramps and the doors are all manual open. So the building itself is not really handicapped friendly.",5

Sharon Powell,"This place feels like a scam. I feel very uncomfortable with the amount of information they kept asking for. Their webpage is defective, yet they won't do anything about it. Instead, ask you to keep sending them more and more information instead of fixing the issue. I started noticing this when at first, I used my phone to upload the information and kept getting callbacks because my documents were not uploaded. Finally, I assumed everything was submitted properly because I used my laptop. WRONG, after verifying/linking my bank account information I was brought to the pending page and could no longer access any other part of my account. To me, that indicates that either everything went through, or something is wrong with the page. Since I received a call, the next day asking for more information I have a strong feeling the page is defective, and now my bank information is floating lord knows where on the internet. They then gave me an email to use and even that didn’t work !!!!!! They call me as if I'm not doing the work when now I'm feeling like I have a part-time job giving away my information. This back and forth has been going on for over a week just for them to tell me that I don’t qualify anymore for the loan.",5

He made sure I understood everything in detail pertaining to my loan. I wanted to say that having people like Christian work for you make someone like me not ashame in taking out a loan to pay off dept.

Bonnie M,"I went to OMF in Maysville ohio. The process was rather easy and quick. The rep at the office was helpful., however….. I went in on the 19th of the month, and I asked very specifically about the due date of the loan, as I didn’t want it due when I also pay my mortgage, ( common sense) the rep stated it would be on or around the date that I was there, so that translated into my due date would be on or around the 19th- 20th each month. Which would have been perfect. The rep also stated that I wouldn’t have a payment due until august. So I budgeted to make my payment for August 19th. I received my money, paid my bills. All was well. Not……I received my statement in the mail around the 18th of July, with a payment  due date of August 6th. I’m like What happened.  I asked to make sure my payment wasn’t due the same time as my mortgage. Well I called the office and the manager answered the phone, I explained I received my statement and it had the wrong due date. The manager stated that they couldn’t extend it out any further, and that I would just have to pay it early. I stated I had specifically asked to have my due date not at the first of the month when my mortgage was due. She then went on to say she overheard the rep explaining this to me, mind you her desk is clear in the back of the office, not to mention she had taken phone calls, yet she heard the rep telling me it was due at the first of the month. I specifically asked  that I wanted the due date opposite of my mortgage. The manager then said well you will just have to pay it early each month . Moral of review don’t trust what they say, they don’t care. Paying back the loan each month would have been no issue had they done what I asked, now it’s going to be problematic each month until I can get things budgeted in a different way. I had hesitations before I went in, now reality is matching the hesitations, I won’t be using this business in the future, as well as the manager at the Maysville branch was a rude, inconsiderate lying, confrontational manager.",5

For about 2 or 3 months I made so many payments straight to principal.  Balance hasn't moved.   Oh and she DESTROYED....MY LOAN MODIFICATION...DESTROYED IT. lied about it. Took my money. Guess she forgot I'm a nurse When we talk, I always have a notepad and pen in front of me. I have the best documentation.  So, just wondering if this is how ONEMAIN ....runs things. I can go on and on and on and on!!!Kz",5

Janice was very perceptive and professional as she covered evey concern while educating me in areas I did not even consider. She was patient, considerate, understanding and relatable as she graciously brought me to a level of comfort to make a decision I was initially apprehensive about. I am glad I decided to make the call and truly thankful I got Janice. The process was fast, efficient and painless. Janice, thank you for your expertise and support, you are definitely a great asset to the OMF institution.",5
Maria Castaneda,Bad customer service. Don’t waste your time. When I called a branch to ask how do I go about referring someone and will I get a referral fee. I was told yes just to text them the link from your account and they could apply from there. OneMain would automatically know who referred them since the link was sent from my account. My niece applied the following day and was approved and they asked her for my social security number in order to send me the referral fee (who goes around giving people there SSN) I called OneMain and the REP that answered was VERY RUDE she asked me for my niece SSN I called that BS. Never again will I use or referrer anyone to ONEMAIN!,5

Connie,My wife and I have used One Main several times. They have ALWAYS been helpful and courteous. The time spent in there office was efficient. I will use them again to assist with our financial needs.I would like to thank the company for there assistance.,5
Sarah Anderson,I Would not waste my time it puts a hard inquiry on your credit score especially if you don’t get approved I recommend not doing it. And when talking to them about it I was nothing we can do to help you so yeah I just messed up my credit score I said OK they said all right well have a nice day. RUN!!!!,5
Cynthia Figueroa,"OneMain does not answer the phone. I called multiple times and did not even get a valid voice main prompt. In addition, when I first called, and the only time they answered, they informed me that the loan officer was away from the desk and would call me back. Its been three days. I do not recommend. In my opinion they are a quack operation.",5
Ronald Price,"very bad experience, the person who attended us was very kind but did not explain well that we would pay $10,000 for a loan of $8,500, balance due ($18,500) The good thing is that they have 7 days to return the money if you change your mind.  My advice, take a good look at what you are signing because in the long term you pay too much in interest, they make your payments very low but if you don't pay extra each month you end up paying the amount of money 2 or 3 times.",5

Alsey Lachney  Iii,After months of ignoring the mailers sent by One Financial I was actually referred by a third party offering financial aid assistance for a class that I really wanted to take. The process was smooth and seamless and the customer service was top notch! The lady that helped me was very patient as I had a lot of questions and also did her due diligence to show me various options that I could take advantage of. It didn't feel pushy and all the information was very transparent. The services provided not only allotted me with the monies I needed for my class but also put me in a better financial situation as they helped me refinance my vehicle as well. I left feeling confident that I made the right decision and didn't place myself in a situation that would cause me more financial problems in the future. To be a company that provides loans the interest rates are reasonable and I didn't feel duped or mislead. I'll definitely do business with them again in the future should the need arise.,4

Due to health problems I have had to retire from working force in run into a financial situation needing money quickly to pay up some bills, because of the tremendous customer service that I have received in the past on several different loans for funerals for new truck purchase etc I returned to One main financial to get a new loan and they were very prompt in addressing my issues and taking my application. We discussed my financial income which is now been limited due to retirement and what my options were to proceed with this loan I had asked about adding to my existing l o a n and was given my options for the new loan. After reviewing all of my options we received the new loan and also lowered our monthly payments on the existing loan by almost $150 what a great tremendous service this is to be able to secure a loan in a very quick manner and a very friendly environment and a very knowledgeable staff, at this time I also selected to purchase other products to go along with my loan that are going to be beneficial to things that import to me like my health great services great attitude of the employees and very helpful and friendly I will recommend that anyone that needs a loan should apply to One main financial and be honest with them and what you need the money for and if there's any way they can they will certainly help you.",5

I got everything in order and came to the office where she went over my options, carefully and clearly explaining my options and completed the process right away including setting up automatic payment and qualifying me for more money than expected that will help with another project that had been put on hold. This is what customer service is all about, thanks Debbie!",5

JERALDINE MUSSER,"Online they approve you for the amount of money you need. In my specific case I asked for $8500 and was approved. I got a plumber to dig up my yard for a sewer leak. I got an appliance person to look at my refrigerator, It needs a compressor. I contacted a fencing company to secure a fence. I spoke with Rebecca, from OneMain, who said she could approve this loan and she would send it up and let me know later on that day when the paperwork would be ready. However, later that evening she told me I was only approved for $1500. Even secured with my automobile they would not do what they had told me the previous day or that morning. What could have changed in a matter of hours that caused my loan to change $7000.00? My credit the day before is the same credit I had that day.I was not given a reason for huge difference. I signed all of my documents online so I didn't have to go into the office. Other people I know who have worked with OneMain have not had this problem and that is why I felt confident in going ahead and making plans with the amount I was approved for at first. When Rebecca confirmed the next day it would be approved I made my phone calls. Well, then there's that.",5
Kutrena Horn,"I never leave reviews online, but OMF was so wonderful to do business with, I want to go out and tell everyone about my experience.I needed a small loan, and was unsure of who I could trust to be honest with me and have my best interest in mind.

The transmission went out in our 2015 Nissan Rogue just two months after we had paid it off. It was shocking and distressing especially since we only have one vehicle. I tried one lender who declined my application even with a co-signer. I had no desire to take on another car payment so quickly. I’d received OMF materials in the mail. I was nervous, however, Marybeth was extremely patient, helpful and reassuring. Also, Marybeth introduced me to her branch manager Brandon Walsh. I highly recommend OMF.",5

Waleska Soler,"In terms of being helped by the representative, i could not be more pleased. However, given that we were never told we needed to bring the vehicle we were using as collateral and had to drive twice as much as we needed to, plus the actual website of OneMain said that due to our excellent history with OneMain we were eligible for up to $18,000 extra in loan money and we were then informed that at best we would be getting $2889, we feel that we were misled. Especially since it had been nearly two years without a missed payment or late payment. I know its a business, but not even being given an adequate opportunity to explain as to why we needed the money we did besides the very general and rather impersonal ""Bills,"" ""Medical,"" etc.Customer service is great. The APR and the almost stoic way of not letting cases be pleaded, not so much.",5

customer,"I started my application on May 18th. On May 31st I was called by a One Main agent who told me my application was complete and I would be called to finalize it. (I had surgery June 1st.) I received an email on June 9th that more documents were needed. They were immediately uploaded. From June 13-20 I was on the phone with One Main agents and supervisors because I was told on the 13th that my application had ""timed out"". On June 20th at 4:16pm EST, I was on the phone with my agent finalizing the application. Suddenly she said that the system went down and she would call me back. I called and left a message for her on the 27th because I hadn't heard from her. On June 28th I called and left a message with her supervisor to please call me back. I called on the 30th because I hadn't heard from anyone. I was on the phone with an agent on July 1st finalizing my application. When we got to my bank account information she told me that One Main Financial doesn't work with my bank, so we can't proceed. I told her that she can send me a check. We finalized the application and she told me I would get an email regarding my check being sent via FedEx. The funds were deposited in my account early on July 4th. This experience has been exhausting and frustrating. One Main Financial agents have been rude, condescending, and repeatedly made false statements.",5

Donald Mccracken Iii,What is the purpose of applying online when your computer still calls and requests information.  I completed a verification online on the 19th. Get a call Monday afternoon for additional information which I sent Tuesday.  Still needed more information on Tuesday again which was sent. Needed to verify employment which I gave information by phone to call. Today is Thursday  June 23rd still no call. Go online and my application has said the same things for days. It is being finalized.,4

Torondo Monroe,"The new person that assisted me was so sweet, explained everything to me and made me feel very comfortable with what i was choosing",5
Robbie,"First loan with them. Wish I had worked with them before, wouldn’t have tried other Lon companies. Beside the fact that I was approved within minutes, considerable amount, the thing that got me is how they operate with so much care and expertise. They call right away after you’re done with your application. Easy to get an approval. Their phone app the best with option to raise your loan amount. Their interest rate, much lower than credit cards. Still with best egg and oportun but once I can consolidate both as well, will do right away. By the way, they push your 1st payment almost two months ahead.",1
Tammy Daniels,Great I love my New bike,5
Charlie Davis,Wonderful people to work with.,5
Malinda Parker,"I felt that the loan offer was a ""bait and switch"". After starting paperwork, I didn't get the skip payment until July as it was advertised to me. I didn't see the seven day option to get out of loan until several days later. I would have opted out.",5
Gloria Vargas Sigala,"I was blessed to have Ms.Naomi as my agent.She was strictly professional and patient, she explained everything from A>Z.And I would refer anyone who needs assistance to her.And she has that glow that makes you feel so welcome.Thank you OMF for having such a beautiful person > your organization.",5
Marsha Robinson,"So disappointed with the office in Anaheim. If you are going to apply for a loan make sure you go to another office. This people didn’t know what they were doing. Daniel was the one helping with my application. I was going back and forth for two weeks with him.  Every time I will call this office I got different information.I had to keep checking in with Daniel because he forgot to submit paperwork or he forgot to call back. Finally got the call yesterday that my loan was approved and all I needed was to go and sign to finalize the loan. When I show up they surprised me that i wasn’t approved because Daniel “forgot” to add the amount of rent that I paid. I mean doesn’t it give you an alert that something is missing before pushing submit?  I spoke to one of the other ladies there even though he was just sitting behind me in his desk and hearing his coworker say “he forgot to add the amount of rent” he didn’t take the time to apologize. There was zero remorse. The fact that I called before leaving work  to make sure of the approval and was confirmed, just shows me how unprofessional this office is. This is not a way of connecting with customer in human level at all. Worse experience ever. I do not recommend.",5

My income went up and my credit score as well as liabilities went down, and yet they advised they couldn't provide me anything more without collateral. Furthermore my initial loan was joint and for my additional they only considered my income? Yea that'll work.

Shiny jojo,"I have had no problems with OneMain in the past but this time was another story. It took me over 2 weeks to close my loan just because of lack of communication. I feel like it should have been a common courtesy to be informed of the fact that the loan officer I was assigned to doesn't work in the office most days (if at all?). I never received a call back any of the times I called and left messages, which was promised several times. I feel like if I had been told up front of what I would face for the timeline of the loan closing, I'd have been more understanding. That being said- hopefully next time I do business to refinance or obtain another loan, I won't go through this.",5

Tiffany Owens,"They're okay people they're professionals the staff is is very good with the attitude and everything customer service is pretty cool but the system is kind of set up in a funky way where it's like they manipulate you to try to get a loan but you can't get the loan well see I already have a loan with them I've been paying on the loan for about 3 years now I'm almost done paying for the loan but every year that I have had the loan about 3 times year they send mails with offers and then they call talking about you can reapply and we can pay off the one loan and get you more money okay with this last time I did it online with their offer it said that  I was approved for $4,900 and that it was going to pay off the old loan and that one main was going to call me to set up the payment arrangements well one main calls me and tells me that I need to put a car down or I need to get the person who was my co-applicant the first time to be a co applicant with me again and they don't know if that still approve me now keep in mind that the system online said I was already approved so what are they talking about I know it's so confusing I think the office branch and the people who handle everything at the corporate are not on the same page!",5

Randy Christian,"This company is a joke. Take your time and money elsewhere! Originally, I received a pre-approval letter in the mail (unsolicited) for up to $10,000... sounds crazy right? Well, I came into a tough spot recently with medical bills, etc. and getting a loan was basically my last resort. I have good credit, mind you, and all I was asking for was $2,000. I got pre-approved again for $4,000+ after providing details online. That's where the real trouble began. I received SIX missed calls from them in one day during my work hours - no messages. So I try to call back after waiting for updates and suddenly the branch can't seem to answer their phones. THREE more days pass and an ""agent"" (very rude and short with me, had no attitude for customer service or helping whatsoever) finally calls me back to waste my time again by asking questions I already answered when I applied... only to find out they're DENYING the loan? How do they even have customers if someone in my situation can't even get approved?? It'd be zero stars if I could rate that.",5
Maria,All in all it was a good experience but I was told I would be notified at a certain time and the call came 30 mins late with out an apology or reason why. But other than that it was good,5

Brenda M,"I've had issues with One Main Financial, Round Rock, TX. branch on and off. I don't trust their accounting one bit. While going through records of payments, online payment history, and balance due, I encountered some discrepancies. I won't get into specifics too much except on my final experience with the Branch Mgr. today, 6-16-22. On 6-13-22 I paid online loan balance of $$259.02. My gut feeling from past experiences with OMF told me to go online and check to make sure all was clear. I did so on 6-14-22, and not to my surprise there is a balance of $5.91, chalk it up to interest right?! Well I paid it right away, looking to clear out account. Again, not to my surprise, I get a call on 6-15-22 from branch, stating I still have a balance. I said hold on there buddy, I paid the balance, and what I guess is an interest fee, so it should all be cleared. Here's where the Branch Mgr. comes into play, he calls me this morning, 6-16-22 to tell me I still have a $39 balance on my account and that we can take care of it today to close out the account. I said, no way Will. I explained I had made the 2 payments in the past 2 days, to satisfy my debt. He says we'll Mario, this is an interest bearing loan, and then there was this loan modification we did on your loan. Just when I thought there was nothing that OMF could do or say to top my past experiences. Well, I was wrong. Picture paying interest on a zero balance, oh and a magical secondary account for hidden fees, not reflected on your balance. I will not return to OMF for any needs, and if my experience is an indicator of company wide experience, I would suggest finding another more trustworthy, better customer service finance company to do business with.",4

I have dealt with several loan places in the past and they all make you feel small for requesting a loan, but OMF didn't! They were friendly, personable, and treated me with respect. Special shout out to Grant who help finalize by loan. He took time to just chat with me about a mutual interest, our muscle cars! He didn't rush me through the paperwork to hurry me up and get me out the door, he answered questions and took the time to make sure I knew everything before signing. Plus I learned some new things about the older Cougars! :)",1

Jo V.,If I could give 0 stars I would. They are a bunch of crooks. They will pile on fees like crazy and you pay and pay and NEVER get your loan amount reduced due to the astronomical interest rates and fees they tack on. What they do may be “legal” but it’s highly unethical the way they prey on people who need help. They are terrible. Please find another way to get out of debt. This isn’t it.,5

But it was Saturday and I understood. We were able to finish closing promptly on Monday. The only thing I’m not happy with “to no fault of One Main Financial…. My credit score” is the interest rate.

Justin Ramirez,"One Main Financial is a wonderful corporation to conduct business with.The representative I was introduced to over the phone was ‘Jacob’.Jacob was not only very kind and professional but he was also efficient in corresponding so that affordability of time would by no means go wasted.After uploading all of the mandatory required documentation I got a call from a branch representative right away.From there I was given the opportunity to schedule my ‘in person’ meeting.I was not only approved for the loan amount which I originally requested but the representative, ‘Jacob’was authorized to alott me a couple hundred extra dollars which was greatly appreciated. The entire process was very simplistic as long as I was able to provide proof of all the criteria which I entered online ( and I was able to provide those necessary documents thankfully 🙌🙏).I desired & asked 4 the loan amount in order to consolidate some of my debt into one easy low bearing interest rate payment.I was able to pay 💰 down & ‘off’ most of my credit cards 💳 which should in turn boost my credit rating.This will greatly simplify my life so that I can concentrate on other projects while improving my credit score & paying lower interest.I was very pleased in conducting business with this company & am strongly looking forward to moving ahead with them involving my future endeavors.",4

Pamela Harpster,They take advantage of you and milk you dry they sell you insurance which is a scam and a way of milking more out of you because it will not payoffs when you need it. I was a long time customer but will never use them again to many other better companies out there. Do not if at all possible use them find another way. They will do all they can to milk you dry. They need to be shut down.,4

A week passed by. Lady called me and said still waiting for my tax return. I said I emailed it. The bottom line is no one knows what the other is doing. I called them 3 x and not once a person returned my call. I finally emailed him and told him to cancel my application. Find another place to get your personal loan.,5

Raymond Olson,"This whole experience was less than desirable and feel as though they used the bait and hook method.  I rec'd letter stating approved for $1500 loan.  After going through the application, they stated only approved for $499.  Then gave alternative to re-finance my car and gave an additional $2500.  Makes absolutely no sense.  I got sold.  They are extremely understaffed and feel the sales rep was less than honest.  Also, stated no payment until following month on basic loan which was not true as commenced as normal scheduled.  Then told me if refinance car, then no payment possibly for 45-60 days, not true either as I had to stay on course with normal payment schedule.  I feel they were completely dishonest and when reviewing final paperwork, they raised interest rate yet again versus what was discussed previously.  I would never recommend them.  Maybe it's not the company, but just the rep I dealt with that was dishonest.  I will pay this off aggressively and never use them again.  Btw, my current car loan is still open and now I am concerned if they are truly paying it off as a refinance. Potential civil matter but hoping they do follow through with that part.",5

I'm willing to bet half or more of these reviews are bot or paid for.Aside from their gouging interest rates, they will try to get their hooks in you in whichever way possible.In one year, they gave me a $6k loan with absolutely garbage credit. I turned around and paid it off in a few months! Since then I have paid all my debts off and reduced my risk, and improved my credit with the exception of some temporarily high balances that were taken care of within a week of it happening. But not soon enough before the credit check. Still, way better situation was in than with my first loan with them.I go to apply for a smaller loan $4500, remember WAY BETTER credit and debt status than when they gave me $6k, and they said they would only give it to me if I put my car up for collateral and they have no say in  the matter. The woman legit told me only the computer is allowed to decide for her. Whether this true or not, the whole thing sounds like a scam to get more out of individuals who are desperate and don't know any better.Do not believe all of these reviews. See for yourself. Bank of America has less than 2000 reviews here on trust pilot, but OneMain Financial somehow has 45k reviews? I'm telling you now, this company is highly skilled at drawing you in and lying about their reputation online.",5

James Jeffers,If you need a loan this is the place to go.  Very friendly courteous and professional,5
Maxine Speaks,"OneMain has always been able to help me with an unsecured loan. This time was no different. Applying is simple.  Qualifiying for the loan is easy even if you have low credit scores Depending on how you want  get your money.. You can get a paper check as soon as the paperwork is done. Or you can have it deposited into your bank account and it's usually available within an hour, and you can truly bring up your credit scores as long as you make your payments on time. The downsides, I think the interest is a little too high, especially with repeat good customers!! You have to borrow at  least 2000.00 That's the smallest loan you can get...but I think highly of OneMain and recommend this place above  any other loan company.",5
LUKE,I thoroughly enjoyed the staff and their kindness and effective communication. They helped me to understand everything and gave me time to provide my documentation.

They offered a lower interest rate and several different loan amounts and term lengths that allow me to choose what I was most comfortable with. They made appointment for me that was convenient, evening time, I work long hours and have few day hours available. I was surprised to find out that they offered a insurance for loss of income situations, that would cover payment of loan in emergency situations, at a very reasonable cost. that was a bonus in my book.

I've payed off all my CC Debt and more. My Credit Score is already in the rise.  Thank you OneMain.",5

Cenovia Vigil,"I tried......I got my card and set up the internet account to manage my transactions. A week later the login information was no longer valid. Called repeated times to get this resolved. Each per son would escalate to the next level. I don’t have access months later.... I’m still waiting for the call back from tech support..........I tried.......I recently got a fraud alert on my card. You know the one that I cannot access over the internet. Over a month, I call customer service there are times my call gets dropped, but I get a promise that my card will become active. I say thank you, maybe a week later I’m at a store, even out dinning, pull out the nice blue card and have to look at the other person an say I’m sorry. My card got declined.... Called again promises are made treaties are signed, purchases are declined. Such is the life at Brightway. To look at the person behind you giving you that stare. You know the one, a mom with rollers in her hair looking at you like if you’re trying to pull one over on the store. You shrink into nothingness. Thank You Bright way!!! You really are numero uno in some multiverse. I tried....Today I tried again, it’s funny I think that a customer knows the script and who to connect to better than a representative:You call, enter you16 digits, wait.... push #5.... listen to the roll.... careful because you have to say ""customer service""then repeat the 16 digits, full name, email, phone number. With a pleasant voice thank you for calling, I’m sorry that is happening, let me put you on a brief hold....But you must know how to navigate, always ask to connect if you are transferred and do not have the necessary information.... dropped call. BummerAt the end of today I was promised my issues were fixed with the fraud. Pray for me my friends that only you understand my frustrations. That I do not face the mom with the rollers again!!!",5

Sharae Kennedy Fulton,"I kept receiving OneMain Financial offers in the mail, like you have been pre-approved for a loan up to $50,000. I was like yeah right, kept throwing them away. My daughter was getting married May 2022. We had started planning back in May 2021 paid deposit over time to the venue. Well the walk through or final planning day came where we had to go over details. By the time we were done we had a huge bill and I thought how am I going to do this? Well I just happened to get another one main offer so I tried. I called the number gave my code spoke to the manager at the branch gave my information and immediately was informed I was approved for the amount I requested. It doesn’t get any better than that I appreciate the opportunity and the staff that helped me. Thank you so much I will refer any and all if they ask do I know of an institution that gives hassle free loans. OneMain Financial you all rock!",5
Ty Davis,"I absolutely LOVED dealing with One Main and their employees. From my first visit and anytime I had questions and/or concerns I’ve always had the pleasure of speaking/dealing with Marian. Marian has ALWAYS gone above and beyond to assist me with all of my needs as well as any questions I may have had. She treats her customers so well, she has outstanding mannerisms and is ALWAYS such a pleasure to converse with.",5
Brenda,"I am very disappointed in the services provided by OneMain Financial. I applied for an auto loan with them. I have an excellent credit score, but the best rate they could offer me was an 11.9% interest, which makes no sense. The customer service representatives were very unhelpful. One of the men I spoke with lied to me and the dealership I went through. He said we could get a lower interest rate once we processed my information, but once we did that, everyone else we spoke with said that was impossible. They told me I would have access to the loan documents that I signed on the portal for 7 days after I signed them, but they disappeared immediately. I called to ask about that, and the woman I spoke with said they would email them to me, but they never did. Overall it's been a very terrible experience, and if I hadn't been pressed for time I would have gone with a different bank. I plan to try to refinance with a different bank, because if 3 other banks I spoke with would have worked with this dealer before and would not have needed documentation from the dealer that would have been outside our time frame for getting the car then I would have gone with anyone of them instead, as they all offered me 5.69% interest rate because of my good credit score. Don't use OneMain!",5

Susan Boothe,"I sure wish there was a quick and easy way through the loan process. There should be a way to streamline all of the steps that one has to go through. I have been getting insecure personal loans from different financial business for years. And because they know me and my history it is very easy for me to walk in, say hello, do my business and walk out within five to ten minutes. One Main Financial takes at least a half hour, and that doesn't include having to get the proper paperwork before you come in. But, in the ""long"" run I eventually get through the process and get approved on most loan applications at a lower % rate.",5

Sunnie Bell,the person on the phone was I formative and very nice . I had a very good experience  .,5
customer,"My experience with my Loan person was excellent. She was very friendly and knowledgeable. My only complaint is more for the company. I used to be allowed to do my loans online from start to finish and now am unable to do so. I think this is a bit ridiculous especially for someone who has been a customer as long as I have. I do understand my credit score may be an issue and if that is the case then I believe that is in so many ways wrong. That’s seems to be when the process between being able to do the loan from home Versus coming in happened. I did have issues for a while but working very hard to recoupe. That should have not bearing on whether I am at home or in person. You are willing to extend the loan to me then as long as I send in the appropriate paperwork, it should not matter where I am. If there is another reason for this process change, I would like to be advised. It is at least a 45 minute round trip for me to get to your facility and the 30 or so minutes it takes when I get there is not conducive to a person who has to work full time and only gets 30 minute lunch breaks. Thank you.",5

Even after providing the ADDITIONAL information requested and explaining and showing proof that money's were deposited in separate accounts that equaled up to my paystub. The person at my local branch implied that I was a fraud while in her office. Jumped through several hoops over a week with these people only to have my time wasted because they are too lazy to do the math. Ridiculous. I do NOT recommend doing business with this company.",5

Jeffery Brady,Out of a little over 12k personal loan that was to Overall be a little over 14k is now turned into over 20k because of predatory practice plus fraudulent activities. After filling insurance claim do to unemployment they have raised my interest rate to 32.32% added over 5000 to my owed balance and taking there sweet time re issuing a check and saying they have reimbursed money when they didnt. After calling they said they will put the request in that day yet my statement already showed it.  Plus making it looked as I owe more then I should and they are losing money they have received. They won't call back when they say they will.  Over 70% of monthly payments go to interest. Out of over 11k paid over 8 k has gone to interest. This is so not what was agreed apon and am reporting. Scam,5

Michele Herman,"I sure hope that if you are reading this, you have a minute but it will be worth it! I am now proud to say that I am a returning customer of OneMain. I had reached out about a year in hopes that I could receive a loan to help repair my credit. I was fortunate enough to get Abby on the phone from the Green, Ohio location. Not only was I granted a loan, but Abby shared incredibly helpful advice that she took upon herself to take the time to guide me regarding how credit works. I absorbed every bit of knowledge that she was able to share. Every time I would use credit, Abbys words were always in the back of my mind. It would even help me to decide whether or not it would be a good decision, or one that could hinder my credit score. Fast forward just over a year later. I called the branch to verify that my account was in good standings. (Not going to lie here to say that I was hoping that I could get Abby on the phone) Sure enough, Abby answered the phone. She advised me that because I had made payments here and there when I had a little extra coin in my pocket, I was qualified to refinance AND receive more money! I had to share with her that her knowledge she had shared, not only helped me, but also helped my mother. (Though my mother has a decent credit score,she began using Abbys tactics to improve it even more!)I am extremely happy to have been given the chance to do business with OneMain. The comfort that they are local and not a random 800 number really puts me at ease. They will work with you on your payments even if you have one of those months that you ordered way too much from Amazon. They just want you to reach out and communicate. I will continue my business with OneMain and I am confident that as long as I stay in good standings, they will always be there when I am in a financial bind.Thank you for giving me a chance even though I had made credit mistakes in the past. You trusted me enough to let me prove to you that my credit is important to me. You have a customer for life!My Best,Stefanie L",5

Michelle ,"My father purchased a work van for my Bussiness through one main financial. We put a down payment down of over 4,000. Every month the payment was automatically taken from his joint account with my mother who is his wife and overseer of his estate. There never was a late payment made on the vehicle. My father later died of cancer  a few months ago which is over two years after purchasing the van. One main stoped taking the payment of 250 dollars from the joint account and my mother who is nearly 70 old and battling with breast cancer also didn’t notice. With out notifying her, who is the overseer of his estate they ordered a Repo and took the van with all of my work tools, Bussiness license,personal belongings, belongings of my clients, clothing that was ordered for my youth football program. And now there saying the van is on its way to an auction and if the final balance of the van isn’t paid off before it’s gets there I will loose everything that was invested into it and inside of it.....Never I repeat never buy a vehicle though one main financial!!!!!",5

Robert Kochanowski,Excellent quick and easy great service thanks Sabrina,5
Andrew Bednar,"I thought one main was great with helping me get my first ever car loan! They were helpful and knowledgeable. The one critique I do have is, you always get a different person when you call and you have to explain your situation over and over and sometimes when that happens things get confusing so I would just say it would be helpful if you were assigned one person to your case and they connected you to that person by case number. My interest rate is high but I know that is be expected when it's your first loan with minimal credit history but I'm am very pleased with my car and the help I was given. Thank you OneMain",5

Gill Matthews,"They drafted my account for almost $600 - the issue is….my account has been closed with them for over a year. They were negligent and managed to charge my banking information on someone else’s loan (and they had his correct banking information which was not even close to mine). How is this safe? How is this secure? What security features do you have in place? This is no small mistake, and has personally caused me damages personally and financially. I’ve already reported this to the Better Business Bureau as well. Why do they still have my bank information when my account has been closed for almost a year?",5
Joyce Damadio,"My initial interactions with One Main Financial was a good one, and the reason I chose to do business with them. The detailed description of the loan znd the options that are available was provided in several different section to endure my complete comprehension and comfort before any transition was completed.  A very pleasant experience !☺️",5
Carlos Vazquez,Paid for “ disability insurance “ on our loan. We have never been late with a payment and are looking to pay it off early.  Was told at time when we initiated loan if disability insurance wasn’t used we would get our 2000.00 back when loan was paid off. Well… yesterday when my husband called and asked for pay off amount.. no lower amount for early pay off and no return of the 2000.00 that was included in loan and financing. They lie. Don’t trust these people,5
Kevin Randolph Sr.,"i never got past the application process because they kept moving the goalposts. i would provide exactly what they asked for, and when i provided it, it wasn't good enough. DL photo (the picture isn't big enough)....credit card statements, which they asked for (No, we cant use that).....bill with your address-----provided a bill on IRS letterhead (No, we cant use that)provided car title etc. etc. etc. and after being told ""No, we cant use that"" for 4 days......I just withdrew my application.  Understand, I was only trying to borrow $5,000. If i were trying to borrow $500,000 I would better understand the colonoscopy they gave me. I honestly don't know if it was the company or if that particular employee didn't know what she was doing.",5
Ramiro Grandos Jr,All representatives were super helpful and courteous and provided efficient and helpful service to us.  The entire experience was painless and the funds were made available almost instantly once the process was finalized.  We highly recommend One Main Financial. Thank You!,5
Delois Harris,It was very easy and fluid process. Hassle free.,5
BERANO/AILYN GREGORI,"It’s absolutely astonishing to me that this company can withdrawal money from your account when they weren’t supposed to and then give the customer the run around when they request a refund. I recently did a pay date change and was informed my next auto payment would not come out until May 17th. May 1st my account was over drafted due to them taking funds that I did not have because I was informed my next pay date would be May 17th. I requested a refund and had to gather “evidence” of THEIR mistake and was told the money would be put back into my account. I called again on Monday May 9th to follow up and was told it would be back in my account in 1-2 business days. The money still did not come today, May 11th. I called to see why and was told I am receiving a CHECK, not deposit, or the refund amount. I was told the “evidence” I submitted was not sufficient for a deposit into my account. They NEVER informed me of this. If they had, I would have gotten whatever they needed. Now I am overdrafted on my account with no end in sight until the check comes in 10-14 business days. Leaving my bank account in the negative, affecting my history with my bank, and hindering chances of future financing because now my bank account is in the negative which normally does NOT happen with me. This company does not care about their customers. They just want to take your money and refuse to make it right when they make a mistake. I will most definitely be looking into a new company for a loan to pay off my Onemain account and not have to deal with their fraudulent ways of operating. They can quickly take money from your account but can’t put it back in the same manner? I do NOT recommend this company.",5
Aimee Tyson,Top notch customer service. Rich and Kim listened to my individual needs and helped me to find an offer that worked best for my situation. The process was easy and painless. Thankyou 🙂,5

Linda Hyduke,"Friendly, courteous, and fast. Explained everything in detail.",4
customer,"OneMain Financial is holding my title for my 2008 Suzuki after they were Paid in Full with interest.  My loan was paid off ahead of schedule and I was told to leave an office because they could not do anything because my final payment was ""pending""  I have reported this to the BBB and FTC.  If individuals conduct business with them, be very weary as they will use detrimental tactics to slow and hold up the process of lien release of your property.   Don't hesitate to contact your local office of legal assistance to rectify these issues.  I will never conduct business with them again and others should use ""good judgment"" in any business transaction with OneMain Financial.",5

Martin Hughes,"well if I could give this no stars it would be great. I have been trying to get a loan from one main financial for the passed week and a half. I have my vehicle as collateral and eveytime they said we were approved, when I would call them back it would change to no we can't do it. I jumped through every hoop that was put in front of me and when I left to get my son because we were trying to get a loan, by the time I got back it had changed ""I'm sorry but we are refusing you to a another loan company. on top of all of that when they ran our credit scores/ reports it caused a report of fraud on my sons credit history. The person that was working kept saying that they were very short staffed. I will never go to this place again.",5

Bruce Huntress,"I wish I could give zero stars.  I've done business just recently.  I paid on time, never missed a payment as I do with all my bills.  I wanted to payoff ny 4 small credit cards.  So, I only needed around 1500.  I get Quay. Nice enough guy and he explained I qualified for more. Didn't need more, but I listened. Pay off my existing loan with them and those smaller credit cards and I'd get back some cash of around $500 or so. He sends me to Latrice stays on the phone with all but 2 minutes to email me some documents and for me to ""load.""  Finished, I called her we went over the loan amount (not what I needed.  It was less than discussed)  which would have placed me in a bind. I was doing excellent with my consistency in paying my debts...I AM  NEVER LATE. I was told we would fund that day by Quay.  Check the recording since they are happy to inform us we're on a recorded line.  We'll. I wait, and wait for the funding well into the night, and Saturday.   NOTHING.   I called Saturday morning spoke to two other people.  One said they weren't in the office.  I called again and was given another # to call.  I held for 20 minutes (not off to a good start).  I was told when Latrice left my loan had gone to another department for a 2nd or 3rd review.   It was declined because I entered my date of birth wrong incorrectly.  No, I DID NOT.  I only UPLOAD MY PICTURE ID, AWARDS LETTER AND BANK STATEMENTS.    Whomever inputed my information entered the information incorrectly.  This young (has a Brooklyn accent) said because of this we have to reenter everything.   I said screw it!!!! I don't need the aggravation nor the headache.  I told her to cancell the loan.  I was passed around, I was told one inconsistency/lie after the next. Probably trying to get a sale and not giving a dam about people.  Well I'll have nothing to do with these kids!! I am a 30 year retired commercial lender.  So I know they are lying about the errors.  I'm done.   I will pay off my loan with them.  I will double up on my payments and pay this off QUICKLY!  Hire some grown ups that are knowledgeable and don't have to read off a script you might be successful.   I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY!",5

Jarod Boyd,If I could give a 0 stars that's what they would get the Smithfield office is a joke..I sat there for 3 hours told I was approved and because the girl put the wrong numbers in which I wrote down and quoted her it came back unapproved if you can't do your job find another one. And this is the second  time first time I was told I wasn't  approved and they called back 2 days later asking me to come sign paperwork. I kindly told her no thank you.

Johnathon Lindsey,This finance company doesn’t give you a chance!!! They denied my loan and I have a great track record. The receptionist was not professional at all.     So i went to another lender and got the same amount with a lower rate and easy fast review with out any problems…In my case I do not recommend this lender it’s a waste of time…..this Response is a poor response because I had no problem with this other lender had the same information like this one did and had no problem….just a cover up!!!,5

After they tried to sell me 5 insurance programs on the small loan I was finally able to sign. I was told funds wouldn’t take more than 1-2 hours… didn’t get to my bank until I made several phone calls waisting hours of my time to get provisional funds put in my account while they waited days for a simple couple thousand. One main financial didn’t release funds and caused a mess of issues for me. Never again,5

Suzanne Hopper,"The customer service at OneMain Financial very personal ! But the High interest rates are unbelievable, Will be paying this lone off in two years!!",5
Carolyn Gonzalez,Overall was a good experience. Applicant and approval was easy enough. I disliked having to come in person to the office. When I did arrive I sat in a room for about 45 minutes before anything was started due to my service provider being “busy” or “on phone calls” and then when I finally got to the point of being done the manager was in a meeting and couldn’t approve my documents to finalize the deal. I had to leave because I had another appointment elsewhere and couldn’t finish at that time. I think an hour of time is plenty if the priority would have been the customer in the office instead of everything else. I came back later that day and finished and even then it was slow. Otherwise they were polite and easy to work with just they didn’t value my time.,5

Rita,"we had a appointment with a person named Steve, who worked at  the Wenatchee branch, although he was from Idaho. We did not know he was not going to help us, once we arrived, fully expecting him to take care of the paperwork with us. After arriving at the Wenatchee Branch we found out  he left for Idaho.  A new person helped us who was still learning the procedures and was not yet familiar with all the paperwork.  Finally Samona came in to finish the set up.  So it was a somewhat disappointing experience.",5

She maintained contact throughout the entire process (which took way longer than it should have, explanation below) but she wasn’t overbearing…you know how “those people” can be!My one negative about this whole thing was the website/portal. It would not allow me to upload certain documents saying it wasn’t large enough (and it certainly was) and some of the documents I uploaded Veronica could t see in her end. A week or so after everything was done I received an email stating all of the documents were received. Someone might want to look into fixing whatever is ailing your website/portal.",5

Aerial Smith called and explained the entire process to me and walked me through every step and I felt so comfortable going into this alone. By the time I arrived at their office the next morning I felt as if I was just stopping by to visit an old friend even though we had never met face to face. There were a couple things that required documentation and Aerial even helped me look those up too. Aerial and the manager there went above and beyond to make sure I secured this loan that day. I left there with money in my bank and a huge weight lifted off my shoulders. Don't hesitate to try them out.",5

Francisco Carrillo,Never ever use this institution for a loan. Nothing but lies and bull. It's a shame that credit karma has them on their website. They say they won't affect your credit by just applying but it does. Interest in the mid to upper thirties. It's the mob and crooks. Don't go there. Ripping off America,5
Terri Ortega,"My husband and I recently applied for a loan with OneMain Financial. It was a stressful process for us however we supplied all the necessary docs that were requested of us. We were assured over and over again that everything looked great and we were even offered different loan amounts we could choose from. All of a sudden today, we were advised the loan was denied. This is devastating to us. We had plans to add on a room to our home. And we were depending on this money to help us achieve that. It is very disheartening to be told over and over again that you are basically approved, then get the news that you were in fact denied. That is a horrible feeling. I think they should not get people’s hopes up for nothing! I think they should come up with a better system that does not involve having people think they have the loan in the bag, just to have that snatched away.",5
Ella Fields ,Why would you send someone an offer and tell them they have no offers after they apply,5
James Mims,"Very pleased, additional amount offered which was super, but maybe at a later time.",5

Paul Nistler,Terrible. They said I was approved then dinged my credit and I spent 2 days going through the process. At the end of it they said I was not approved. Awful experience.

Glenn Davis,"The only thing I would like to say is One Main has been there for me when I needed them, I've been with One Main for years, I actually paid off their first loan to me and went back to them when I needed more money. The other important thing I wanted to say is they gave me a loan even though my credit score went down, and I believe they were looking more on how I paid them back in the past then they were worried about my credit score. I really got to say they are willing to take a chance on the previous customers and that's what makes me go back, never had 1 problem with them and That's a big plus.",4

James Bell,I went to the Slidell office Bernie was very helpful and knowledgeable the process was fast loan was approved in about 15 min and money was in my account in about thirty minutes.after they posted this review I was reading others. It makes me irritated when you read something that dumb people post claiming that the reason they got denied was possibly because the shade of of there skin . When actually they were denied because they did not have income and prob had bad credit or low credit score.,5

After letting someone else drive my vehicle there with me in it due to a broken ankle and waiting over an hour. I was told my adopted income could not be used because my daughter will be 17 next month. Another issue the portal wouldn't upload my information and their fax did not work. The lady keep saying we will work something out. Then once talking to her manager came back with there is nothing we can do for you. Maybe it was my complexation but I find this as wasted time and HORRIBLE service. I would not recommend them to anyone.,5

Just dont like the personal questions concerning my assets.  example: I need answer as to why you dont want to leave your collateral as an option for a secured loan.

customer,"Shannon is a true blessing to me. She answered all my questions was super patient with me and explained everything clearly to me. She is a burst of sunshine in my gloom. I had a balance with GM financial that I only had 9 payments left. But, the payments were kicking my butt. While I was honored with this loan from OneMain Financial I know that I took on more months to pay off this car. However, it is a blessing to me to have lower payments by 135.00. Now, i can sleep at night with no worries and work on paying this loan off early and this is going to help me build my credit. I was also giving a portion of the loan to pay off more debt I HAD🙂 Again, Shannon is a true blessing to me. I thank you all for helping me work through my debts.",5

Great people, great service, and fast easy process.  Yes the interest rates are higher than a bank maybe, but One Main looks at more than just a credit score when they loan a person money. They seem to look at the person and their ability to make their payment also, not just the credit score.",5

Marguerite B,"I was very happy to receive a loan unfortunate about having to use my vehicle but  this is a great opportunity to rebuild my credit with the loan i have 5 stars up to the first of April. I was contacted by the local office saying i was pre approved to get more money because in 3 months had already paid 1000 more towards principal.so thought it was a no brainier. I could get refinance because I'm paying the highest amount which i don't understand because it says on website interest rate would be lower with a secure loan but that's my fault for not looking better. This is  long sorry but I wanted to refinance to get a lower rate the rep at my local office pulled my report and said declined ok that was it. Another inquiry and it was obvious she did not look at my file because she was bringing stuff up on my credit report that i had already proved when I got the first loan it was etc. bottom line One Main offered me to get a few more dollars so i believe i could get a few more bucks if they would lower interest rate. I dont think this person at my local office reviewed my file. By then I was furious asked for a email our contact so i could ask why this was allowed this was on a Thursday said would call back Friday well no call its been 6 days going to call office today doubt ill get any help the have title and my signature so why would they help I hope I'm wrong will change review and let yell know thanks, going to GOOGLE now to leave a review",5

Allison Green,Because the person that helped me gave me all the information I needed and had excellent customer service.,5
Tina P,"I am a card holder of One Main Financial Bright way and though the representatives were courteous I am disturbed due to this credit card and loan company not having anything in place for hardship. Though it is to rebuild your credit during this Covid pandemic era many people have lost their jobs or have become disabled therefore their income is none or has decreased tremendously. I pay my card on time every month and at this time when I need assistance in order for my credit to not be affected and to relieve my mind at least for one month, I was told there is nothing they can do to accommodate me. I was like WOW. That is not real. I called two other creditors and they both had things in place to help those who are affected. The first representative I talked to just left me hanging and the other actually informed me that they don't have anything in place, but I could ask for a one-time late fee removal from my account. I gave a 3 because there is a button that states help but this is not helping me at all. You all need to put something in place for hardship. I know there are many people who feel the same way I do. I am being honest but it is like saying everything is perfect which it isn't so a company must allow for unfavored circumstances to protect themselves and to show the customer that they do care. I am so done with this creditor when I obtain another job, I will pay this card off and cut it up.",5
Glenda Snowden,Everything went fast and smooth got more money than I expected and was happy with Debby,5

An hour later I got the additional funds deposited in my bank account and the next day I paid off all of my credit card debt to zero. I found out about OMF from Experian afer I was approved for a AMEX card with 300.00 limit and added my wife for an additional card.

Cathy Marks,"This experience was the longest and most time consuming loan that I have ever had to go through. We started at 11:45 am and it was not completed until 9pm! We went through the multi-step interview process of setting up the email, the profile, uploading all the information that was needed (DL, income, insurance). After that it goes for review. Each time we spoke to someone we were told it would be about 30 minutes and someone would call back. That process went on from 5pm to 9pm! All of the information had already been submitted. I have never gone through the interview process with another loan company until this. I had actually been told by the car salesman that we were approved by just after noon. So, why it took 9 more hours to finalize is amazing! I told the person on the phone with OneMain that we were already approved, had the payment amount, percentage rate, so I was confused why we still had to go through the ""interview process"". We finally left the car lot at 8pm (which is an hour drive home) and just waited for the rep from OneMain to FINALLY call us to finalize. We would not recommend to anyone to go through all of that process!",5

Agata B,"So i felt the need to come back on here and just say even though i feel this company is awesome, well we just didn’t feel they actually went out of their way the 2nd time we needed them after an unforeseen incident came up! Ofcourse we weren’t able to have the first person we dealt with again, and we feel that would’ve made a huge difference in how we felt overall! It had nothing to do with us not getting approved for a tad bit more, but it def wasn’t the same experience! Even though there was no reason whatsoever we shouldn’t have been approved, i mean seriously! But after explaining why our first pmt would be late it litterly went down hill from there on how it seemed we were judged! Then after setting a new pmt date it was firmly told to me we would have to pay a late fee which was fine, but because of my stressful situation i got the dates mixed up and when i called in plenty of time to explain and change the pmt date by a week the lady told me it wouldn’t/couldn’t be changed again, so it bounced like i told her it would! Obviously we didn’t get off to a good first start, but we also didn’t expect a break in plus other things! We did communicate, but def wasn’t given much respect! I’d given anything if we could’ve had our original Loan Manager that did our Loan! OMG she was just so awesome and even though other folks were nice, it just seemed like we were bothering them more with our requests and explanations! I’m just sayen! But had we been approved for that “tad” bit more it would’ve made such a difference and would’ve saved a lot of unnecessary stress!",5

That's my 5 star review. We all put our pants on the same way everyday and they made me feel like there's hope.. I am thankful for your kindness & Help .. Sincerely , Melissa Benthagen & Baily",5

Des,"OneMain is nothing more than a predatory loan company. They're very willing to hook you into a high interest rate loan initially, then abandon you, even if you're a good standing client with zero late payments. They'll also send numerous teaser mailings and phone calls, and then decline you for additional funds, even if it's less than your original loan. DON'T I repeat, DON'T use OneMain unless you want a high interest, predatory loan.**Don't get me wrong, I was not forced to obtain the loan and I take full responsibility for it, but I expected better customer service going forward**Also... be careful if you're a ""Credit Karma"" customer because they promote OneMain as a reputable loan company!",5

Furthermore, when I called in regards to finding out when it would fund, I was told one thing, and One-main did another.  I cannot trust this company, I cannot trust their policies, I cannot recommend them for anything including taking out the trash or mucking out horse stalls.",5
Troy F,"I have been a customer of One Main for a while and was very disappointed at being denied a car loan.  I was considering taking money from my retirement funds and ending my account.  But Victora in the Martinsburg, WV office is the best. She is kind, considerate,  understanding and even in the  worst times, she maintains a positive vibe. I am still a customer because Victoria treats me like a valued customer despite being denied a car loan. The people who denied my loan disregarded my 28 years as a State employee, Covid, I broke my arm and was workmans comp or that I have never paid my loan late (circumstances that would cause a person to need added monetary support). Victoria is a rock star.",5

Karou Fox,"Working with Rebecca was frustrating. Every call I was asked the same question at least 3 times. She said both of us would need to be available at the same time to close online. She asked me if 9:00am Monday would be ok. I said yes. She ended up calling at 9:23am instead. My husband said he would like to come in to sign, she stated that it was ready to be closed online. We went thru the signing process, but she said my screenshare wasn't working. I went thru the documents as she was explaining to my husband the co borrower, and I was signing with him from my phone as the borrower. When we got done, she said she had to go over the same thing with me because the screenshare wasn't working. I told her I already signed it. She told me that I was wrong because the screenshare didn't work. Then she said we could come in and sign since we were taking so long. My husband asked to do that from the beginning! She put me on hold then came back and said my documents were signed. That is what I told her before. I have gotten 2 loans from One Main previously and this process took way longer than before and was not as straight forward, the back and forward with supporting documents. Process started Thursday evening and didn't close until Monday.",1

Elizabeth Ann C,"Agent first represented terms with a secured loan. When I accepted I called back and was told they had quoted unsecured and changed the terms. Then at closing with the documents in front of me the agent represented an 18% apr in terms- after going through everything it jumped to over 23%. Finally after running back and forth on hold I was told the first APR was only the option if I picked all their additional loan insurance products and was a system error the agent had never encountered before - but that made no sense because when I asked about what it would be if I picked the products the terms changed again. Finally at closing after declining everything again I was told “well looking at your job history it looks like you’ve been at your current job for less than 6 months. When layoffs come you could be the first let go, are you sure you don’t want our unemployment insurance?” It was pushy and misrepresenting throughout the whole process. And for One Mains reply below- it’s what your agent told me about why the rate jumped from 18 to over 23 during the signing of the loan. She told me one thing, and something else was on my computer screen and the reason she gave then resulted in a third set of new numbers. Total bait and switch, all during the closing call.",5

That they would pay off the balance on my $3000 Unsecured Capital One credit card. The balance was only $150. Also they opted to refinance my 2015 Ford Taurus Limited with balance $6000  and scheduled to be paid off in 14 months. Then they would give me $3000 and keep the title for 60 months with me paying them $308 per month (for 60 months). To me it sounded like a worthless deal, I declined.  Don't trust them",5

Evan R,"I was told that I was qualified for a loan (12k) they just needed to verify my income. I am not sure who does their mathematical calculations, but they took my income and decreased it by 40% which took my earnings below qualifications. They should have run the credit AFTER verification of income process. That would have saved 2 days of complete frustration, plus a hard hit to my credit, which is 698 with perfect payment history for 4 years. My loan offer dropped by 10k.... shop around before settling on these guts.",5

Donald B,I had a horrible experience with my local one main financial branch. They took what seemed like forever to process my application. Everything I called to check my application status they required additional information which all could have been asked for at the initial phone call. They sent the loan money to the wrong account I had to wait until my bank sent the funds back before they could cut the check. All together it took about 10 days to get a loan when it should have only been about 2 or 3 days at the most. I will never take another loan with them or refer anyone else to do the same.,5
William R,"I do appreciate what they did for me, help me when I need money the most, thankyou  very much.",5

Edward K,"I was told I could use my vehicle for collateral. I asked for $5000 but was told the most they could do was $4200. I provided all the necessary paperwork, they even had me change my insurance so they could be put on the title. Long story short I get to my appointment and after an hour waiting, I’m told sorry we made a mistake you don’t qualify but if you pay your vehicle off, come back we can help you! Wow what a slap in the face",5
Brian,"I wanted to purchase a home 2 months ago. To get approved, I needed my scores at 750 to 800. I was in the high 500s, I had too many negative remarks and hard inquiries so I needed a fast credit repair help. I read a review on a Credit Specialist stating he could get it done ASAP. I reached out for help. After 3 weeks, they cleaned up all negative remarks including the hard inquiries and boosted my scores to 765. I got the house after 1 week and all thanks to them. I thought someone out there might need their help:(fixmycredit  @ writeme D0t com).",5
Scott S,"Services provided by regional office were professional, courteous, accommodating.",5
customer,Fast and friendly service. Very professional staff and knowledgeable,4
Carol D,"Onemain is a hoax, they are using their information on credit karma stating they can do a loan with low credit score, as an excellent opportunity to get, by using your vehicle as collateral, but if they have to pay it off and use the equity to pay off other debt, so you can have one payment. But they said no, they will not pay off the vehicle and use the equity towards your other debt. So what they advertise is a hoax for people like me whom really needs the help instead of filing bankruptcy.  I have a steady income from retirement pension and currently got hired for a new job and just waiting for the start date. So in my opinion this company does not help people whom really needs it and uses your credit karma for falsifying their information.",4
Diana B,Excellent experience. Process was quick and above expectations.,5
Carol N,"In a perfect world, I would not need to take out a loan.  Unfortunately, I did have the need and I worked closely with Christine of the Royal Palm Beach office.

You made my day and you're amazing.",5

Carol Williams,The loan representative/employee was very helpful/knowledgeable & very professional...Face-2-Face is much more helpful & easier to understand...,5
Marilyn W,In all it was horrible why because the people should be more nicer and considering others feelings because u never know why people snap and what they're going through at the time when your steady getting smart at the mouth and talking over them as if you're the only one that knows things. Tyra was a handful and the way that she talks at you and cut you off very sarcastic i guess she only looks for a check don't value the company's oath. I say count ur days young girl because they will be replacing u soon with a computer.. I'm pretty sure if we weren't over the phone it would've been more nicer In-person.. Funny part is I never had to go through this treatment when they were Springleaf. Brandy I guess has a higher pay now she don't deal with the customers but instead send us through to the people that will run their business in the ground.,5

Once we done the loan I did see the $499.00 went into my account then I noticed that the payment went through on 2-28-2022 of $390.13, so I called to see if it was an error and I was told it wasn’t an error, so I only received about $100.00. Your employee should not lie to customers saying that you will not have to make a payment and then have to, that seems like a lawsuit, I’m not happy with the way I was lied to, I’m looking in to see if this is against the law.",5

I can onlybtell the truth about a place where they call me by my 1st name, they never dropped the ball and they followed up with me during a real busy time in my life... they are beautiful people and it was such a pleasure just asking them about all their services... they rock at everything and their mobile app is so easy and they communicate and explain the whole process so throughly that I felt great from beginning to the end and even after...

They are unprofessional, do not have a clue on how to review your account, cannot answer intelligent questions  are abrasive...... basically SIMPLETONS!  If I had a choice, I would never have done any business with this wanna be lender.

Charlene T,Do not use this company if you EVER want them to actually send you your car title. I paid my loan off early and it has been MONTHS and I still don’t have a title. Funny how they keep calling and wanting me to take out a new loan and they can’t even complete the first transaction. I called the county clerk like they told me to so I could get a replacement. THEY STILL HAVE A LEIN ON MY TITLE!!!   I pod this off months ago. So I call and they say “oh the lean was put back on the title in January I don’t know why I will mail it to you”. 4 days later I get a lien release letter no title and now I have to take off work and go down to the county clerks office and get a replacement issued that will cost me a replacement fee. Not to mention taking off work. I did everything I was supposed to do. Paid on time or early and even paid the loan off early and so now they have my money and my title. I am filing with the BBB next and the attorney general. I should not have to go through all of this to get the title to my vehicle back when I met all the conditions of the loan.,5
Margie W,"Great people to work with.  Loan approval that day, money in the bank the next day.",5

John S,"I contacted ONEMAIN FINANCIAL 2 weeks seeing the advertisement on Experian. I applied for a loan to consolidate my debt. Through many phone calls the rep Derrick said, I needed a co-signer because of DTI. I knew they pulled my Experian but no other report...yet. I reapplied a 2 weeks later with a co-signer, and he worked out, but they wanted to pull my report again. Ok, then my Equifax because of the co-signer report was pulled through Equifax. I manually unfreeze the report, they said they couldn't access the information. I called Equifax while they were on the phone and the Rep said it was unfrozen. The manager said to unfreeze it permanently not temporarily. I said why? She said you can freeze it right after. I said i don't understand why you need this report but ok. The Rep took the temporary freeze off. Derrick called back and said do you have a freeze on your Transunion. At this point, I said why are you needing that credit report? He never gave a straight answer. He said I have you almost done. I said if you have to have that one too, never mind. I ended the call. 2/26 the very next day I check my credit report and I have (3) inquiries on my Transunion report, I have (2) on my Equifax report.  I have no idea why that was necessary and why so many. 2 of the inquiries were 2 days back-to-back (2/22 and 2/23). He never gave a straight answer to why they needed to pull from all the bureaus. Needless to say, I withdrew the loan application because if the manager or the loan rep can't give a simple explanation on the process to a potential customer well I don't think that company needs my business. I hope someone addresses this because its really unnerving to know that I have 5 inquires and no explanation to why.",1

Christopher J,Very professional and understanding staff.,5
Gary H,"Update: OneMain disputed my review asking me to remove employees’ names. I did. It’s noteworthy, however, that they did dispute the rest of it. I guess they realized they can’t dispute the truth. OneMain uses deceptive practices. It’s a bait and switch operation. They offer great terms then when you talk to a real person at the local branch the story changes. Beware. Branch manager [Name Deleted at OneMain’s Request] in Orlando literally called me “a moron” for believing the information on their website. [Name Deleted at OneMain’s Request (different than previous name)] kept talking over me when I was asking her legitimate questions. I originally included the names of the people so that others may be cautious when dealing with OneMain Financial but they complained so I removed them. Just don’t trust any of them, I guess. They collect a lot of personal information and have shown they are untrustworthy. Protect your identity and don’t hand over your data just so they can changed the terms of the “approval”. They posted the same response to my review as they post to every bad review. It reeks of feigned customer concern.",3

Mario O,"Horrible establishment!  I am having a hard time financially as well as personally. My husband is extremely sick he may become a quadriplegic. A guardian angel whom would like to remain anonymous made a payment for me. On the fourth of this month One Main Financial did not try to deduct their payment from my account because it was already paid. If a payment wasn’t made I would have had an insufficient funds fee and my statements would show that they tried to deduct the payment. Because the payment was made it showed as paid until 7 days later, only then did they try to deduct the funds from my account and then I was hit with an insufficient funds fee. Had they try to deduct the funds on the fourth I would have then been hit with an insufficient funds fee and it would be on my statement. The payment was made so the automatic deduction was made because they already had the payment. They are trying to get a double payment or get me to disclose someone whom would like to remain anonymous. If I don’t tell them who this anonymous party is they are going to ruin my credit or get a double payment. I am disgusted! At this hardship time someone tried to make my life just a little bit easier, but no! These scoundrels want more money that I do not have and do not owe them. If a payment was not made on the fourth as agreed my bank statement would reflect it. I just shows 7 days later only then did they try to make a deduction. I’m on disability, my husband is ill , facing permanent immobility and I guess I’m ripe for the picking to get extra monies.  I would beware of an institution with absolutely no integrity!",5

I asked her where I was supposed to go and she Told me to go to Lowe's Home improvement, 200 yards away.  Im there to get an additional 5k for a family emergency to add to my 4800 current loan at 27% and I can't use the restroom?  Talk about customer service!  This Lady broke the mold.

Terri R,"I am writing this review due to a unforgettable experience that I had with the Onemain financial office located in Garland Texas. I can truly say that customer service and qualified help is truly lacking in this office. I called in to the office, regarding a co borrower application which I was aware of when I called explained that my co borrower would be calling in at a different time with their info due to our different schedules. The short version of this horrifying story is that the young lady ran my credit without the coborrower information and when the co borrower called stated she would be unable to process the application until I called the credit bureau to ask them to remove the inquiry. This office refused to rectify the situation. I ask what I’d the point in stating you have a co borrower unless you add the information. I contact the regional manager Tim several times in which he basically told me his exact words were “ Okay okay so you had a bad experience I get it” , but did nothing to rectify the situation. The right thing at the very least would have been to call the credit bureaus to rectify their employees mistake . All I got was passing the buck and the manager Autumn stated they don’t do anything that involves the credit bureau yet they are running credit applications. I would not recommend this branch to anyone . They don’t care nor are the individuals working for them qualified. When I ask the young lady who ran the app several questions her answers were she did not know , so why have someone working with sensitive information that doesn’t know what they are doing. I will be filing a complaint with the Attorney general as well as other reporting agencies.",5

HAMISI,I’m a satisfied customer,1
Charles T,Process of approval worked wonderfully - however very disappointed in the process of recieving funds - not sure what the root problem was because they cannot explain why it is taking over a week to get the funds.  Bank transfer did not work an still waiting for the paper check.  Trying to get an explaination or resolution was told the manager would call me back - NEVER happened.  Everytime someone said they would call back - NEVER happened - phone system to get through to the location was hard to get through.  But they never called me so had to go through this hassel... BTW am still waiting for funds some 7 days & they advertise in mass email that it could or would happen within 24 hours.... Am a returning customer and in good standing so having 2nd thoughts of using them again but was forced to in order to get funds for medical purposes an now am going to miss some of my needed medications!  Very disappointed now unhealthy customer.,5

Michelle F,"(The Tustin, CA Office)I've been a client for the past 4 yrs. Always made my payments on time and wanted to do a debt consolidation loan using the balance I already paid down. Thinking this would be a good and easy thing to do because I'm a current good paying client, it wasn't. This company flat out declined my loan because of their ""MADE UP"" underwriting guidelines. My pay history on my credit report is excellent and they still won't approve me for a $5000 loan even though I make over $220k a year and own a home. Is this how they treat all their customers or do they have  unqualified people making bonehead decisions creating rules as they go along. I've been disrespected and will never do business with these people again.",5
David R,The office staff was very friendly and helpful. Office was very clean.,5
Paulette G,I am going to add my review on yelp and on FB about the really awful customer service I’ve received with OMF - this is now the 3rd time you guys have caused a NSF with my original bank and I never receive a resolution that is in my favor because I receive a excuse “it’s the system” - that is not a resolution nor is it going to work for me and ultimately not for OMF - I’ll refinance with Mariner Finance because at least they tried to keep their customers happy and worked hard at it - OMF - just is second rate!,5
Tina S,"Stay away! One Main are loan sharks. They specialize in predatory lending. I have reported them to the state auditor and the state attorney general to investigate. They enslave you by charging you interest daily. When going over disclosures, they talk quickly over these fine and important facts. Go anywhere else if you can. They will bleed you dry charging you 28% interest. On one statement I looked at only $3.28 went to principal on a $600 payment. In 30 years of banking experience I have never met a group so unethical.",5
John L,Don’t lose you time High interest rate and perfect credit,5
Gabriel F,"Honest, quick, easy, friendly. Money was in my account fast.",5
Lyle Banks,"I drive many miles a day for work and needed to quickly empty my bladder before signing the documents today but the lady at the Broken Arrow, OK location said her bathroom was not for public use due to COVID. She was not even our lender. Steven, our lender, said I could use the restroom. But she spoke up and said, “UM…remember that email that came out a while back?” So before I could sign my papers, I had to leave and look for a place to use the bathroom. It was almost 4:45 and she knew if I was not back by then, I was not going to get my loan. She is pretty wrong for that. I made it back with four minutes to spare.",5
Phillips Ashley,"I hope this review is seen by customer service representative at OMF so that Justin Mendoza receives notice that I as a customer really really appreciated that he would not let me give up on resetting my online account. He was well spoken, patient, professional, and would not give up on getting my account back for me to see online. I said after about 15 minutes, Justin I'll try some other time and he politely said, no matter how long it takes I will figure it out and get you back online. Justin did just that 😊 I give Justin 10 stars 🌟.",2
Carlos G,I had a great experience with One Main Finacial. I believe it was Michelle that helped me and she was very pleasant throughout the whole process.,5
Jeremy B,very unhappy with my experience.....after three days of sending them all the information they wanted......they told me i was approved and the money would be sent to my debit card the next day.....i received nothing and when i finally spoke to someone on the phone (not the person) I was dealing with I was told I was denied with no explanation.....by the way I have excellent credit and i'm employed full time.,5

Valerie C,Unfortunately they were unable to help me. No problem. They told me congratulations I was approved they just needed to verify income. I tried explaining special circumstances the agent Adriana was not willing to to take time to listen. This is a zero based credit agency. Thankfully I was able to move to an agency based on credit and get an approval and they considered all income and was considerate of all income as it is still based on me and my previous work years. 5 days vs 1 day and I never had to chase the other company down for an answer.

John M,was very nicw when i went to the brance to get my personal loan was very bice peoplw,5
Dion,"This place is very awful. Specifically Honolulu branch. I'm getting emails about loan invitations with no impact on credit score, but my experience was the opposite. I wanted to buy a new car, and my credit history is about a year old, but i got no debt with a good credit score. I applied with them, and they said they couldn't give me any offers without a hard credit check. I consented to it, it lowered my score, and it was all for nothing because the offer they gave me, was to put a lien on my car, and give me a loan for what my car is worth, under 26 or 44 percent a year, i forgot which one. First time I applied was for a personal loan, and i thought maybe I'd have a better offer if we went through the process as an auto loan from the very start. I thought they wouldn't have to do a hard credit check since they already have one of those of me from less than a month ago already on file. I also thought auto loans were more generous since they lien the car they are buying and aren't in as much risk as a personal loan. Well, they said AGAIN they couldn't do anything without a SECOND hard credit check, they gave me a second hard credit check in less than a month. I got a call back from an old lady in her 65+, and she complained to me, to my face, about how the high number of credit inquires make my credit score invalid. Then offered me the same deal, to put a lien on my car, and put a lien on the car they are buying, under insane interest percent. In summary. 1)They made credit inquiries count not 10 percent for what a credit history is worth, but 100 percent. 2)They gave me two hard credit checks, meanwhile their parent company promises no hard credit checks. 3) they have old people employed whom are senile baring any professionalism they are supposed to have. Like not complaining to the customer about the customer. Like not insulting their file and claiming their credit history is worthless. 4) The options for no credit history/credit building customers are absolutely abysmal. Insane interest rates predatory loans, secured by customers own wealth. What is even the point? OneMain financial, didn't help me, talking to them only wasted my time and did damage to my credit report. What a dumpster fire.",5

Here's my issue...he should've gotten the $100 for sending me there but HE DIDN'T . First they gave the excuse that I signed my loan before him ( I signed the same day 3 hours before him because he works). so then they were going to give it to him but then Shane wouldn't answer the phone. Now they say because mine was a payoff? it doesn't count??? Come on!! They're making almost 10 grand between us in interest and they can't honor their $100 referral bonus???  RIP OFF How can ya trust this company now? So petty...update...avoid ""bobby""(?) ..she talks a good ""hey, I'm down-to-earth, you can trust me"" game, but as soon as you sign the papers...she could care less about anyone...it's months later and I'm still fuming. I could kick myself. This is how they treat a veteran? Grrrr.",5

HEATHER,"I was very pleased with the agents & was approved for my loan, then upon closing the loan the dropped my loan amount by 1/2. I was ready to take their offer until the agent asked me if I had any questions, so I asked her what was the reasoning behind the lower amount. She broke it down for me & they had me me getting paid from my job at less than 1/2 of what I make a month. So she recalculated the right income & my off came out to be $500 short of what I was originally approved for. Overall I’m very happy & would of given 5 stars if it wasn’t for the wrong amounts of my income to what they offered. Thankfully I asked that question so everything was corrected while I was on the phone.So One Main Agents please listen to the answers & type the info in correctly & double check all the documents you ask for to what you type while doing the application process then double check it before you give approved loan amounts & all other info that goes with it before asking the person to choose their loan options! Thank You for listening & giving me a chance to build my credit! I look forward to being a client!",5

Sandro G,"I applied for a loan with OneMain Financial over a week ago. I was told I would qualify for a $24,000+ loan and it would take 2 business days. 6 business days later and after numerous back and forths with this company asking me for repeats of uploads of documents I was approved for a higher interest $17,000 loan that does not meet my needs. I would never have allowed them to hit my credit for this and I would never have allowed them to waste over a week of my time to lead me on thinking they were going to give me the loan I needed when they had no intention of doing so. They are not honest, they are pretty incompetent at handling documents, and quite inefficient. I am very sorry I ever engaged them in the first place. I will not ever use this company or one like it. Very dissatisfied.",5

And keep trying to sell you that if you use your paid car for collateral the rate would be cheaper but would not tell you that rate or how much you would save. I am using my loan for medical bills until my check arrives soWon’t be stuck with the 33% rate for long . But to all BE CAREFUL WITH THIS COMPANY could place you in a bigger mess.,5

Have changed my last name, have not had any mail forwarded to me from old address and yet they must be using my SS# to track my new address and send me solicitation when I have asked them to STOP.  I WILL NEVER EVER do busy with One Main Financial again EVER.  They were okay when I lived in Illinois.  When I relocated to TN with my job--THEY WERE AWFUL AND SCAMMED ME OUT OF $1,000. IN 7-DAYS.  Now I have relocated again with my job to another state and they are still sending solicitation even though my last name has changed.  I even called them to stop solicitation and they are so desperate--or intentionally annoying because I wrote a TRUTHFUL BAD review IN 2018 of their Memphis Kirby store location.  There should be a negative option for review.  From me they get a negative -1000.",5

Aaron C,"This review has it's ups and downs,  highs and lows. From the phone to phone aspect of things much improvement could be done. As far as communication goes I might as well have been trying to carry on conversation with Helen Keller. I was given wrong information, no information and lead through this process that had been completed days prior. At one point I was told that the closer who was assigned my request and was suppose to have had already contacted me in regards to the closing no longer was employed there. So my  process sat idle for who knows how long. I requested to close with the next available agent. The reply was that they would have to review my  loan application again and reassign it. At this point the cash that I needed for time sensitive issues had already been gone with the wind. At this point I am not pleased by any means. So I say to myself, #%*€ this ÷@$£! I am going to handle this directly in person. I arrive and am greeted professionally, my loan processed on site and a check handed to me. The guy in the office was experienced and understanding. Now the check I received is a whole different issue. After deposited into my account I am told it will be available in two business days. Which has turned into a nine day predicted wait time now. I still have not gotten to withdraw a cent of the loan and it is annoying as #%€÷!",5

Michael A,"Borrowing money these days is not easy.Groups of companies have websites that people can use to check their credit scores, decide on where to go for a loan or credit card. My credit is getting better. I was happy when I was able to pay off a loan. To my surprise and dismay, my credit score dropped! No one seems to understand that paying off a loan gives the borrower more money each month to do things with. And a bit left over to add to the savings account against the next emergency. One Main Financial gets it. They understand that being able to receive a sum of money helps to pay the rent, clear up an old loan, and have some left to buy groceries. A timely process that results in a rapid deposit of funds helps to avoid late fees elsewhere which renders the loan useless. OMF works with the client, understands the needs, explains the requirements in simple terms. They get the job done. And they stay in touch.",5

We also did not have enough money to completely pay our current bill at OneMain Financial. I Tried to borrow money from My Siblings but No luck. I went to OneMain Financial and Honestly explained My problem with money. I was Expecting, Maybe to get some type of Deference maybe an extension on Our payment date. What We got instead was Someone whom went out of their way to ensure that our Loan was redone. We Not only received a Lower Percentage on our loan, We received some Additional Christmas Money And Pay at a Later Date!",5

Casey Vigus,"Although the representatives all were very cordial and professional, the process, the portal and everything about getting this very small loan processed was horrible.  Every single time I was asked to provide a document or a signature, I did, but what took place following that was more and more requests, rather than just explaining it all at the beginning.  No one ever mentioned that the title document had to go to FedEx.  The requests and requirements seemed to never end. It was to the point of complete and utter frustration.  I want to get this loan paid off quickly and hopefully not ever have to go through this again.",5

Then they increased my amount didn’t tell me. And still haven’t paid off my title loan! So now I owe like 400 in interest to them! No communication. I’ve had a few loans with them but inside of a store, over the phone is bad. Now inside of a store is slow no one responds!",3
Khalil A,quite possible the nicest people you could ever work with! They were so helpful explaining what I could do and what might be most beneficial. We had a good experience putting this loan together and when it is paid off I won't hesitate to come back to them for future help!,5
shannon harrell,"Customer Service was great!!! The lady I talked to walked me through everything when applying for the loan and was very patient. She worked around my schedule which was awesome!!! You will need a computer when going through the final steps to get the loan and the process takes approximately 30-40 minutes. I applied for 3,000 to begin with but it turned out I was eligible for 5,000 so I took it. They also offer a credit card at the end of the loan with no monthly or initial fees so I also got that. What really stood out to me is they offer insurance on the loan(costs about $180 I think), in the event I die my family doesn't have to pay the loan back which is awesome, no other loans I have ever got did that. I also signed up for that, whats an extra 180, also they give you the full loan amount and add any additional fees or service fees to the total loan amount. For 5,000 plus the additional services I signed up for and after fees the total I need to pay back before interest is around 5,300.",5
LaDonna Rice,It was the easiest and best interaction I have ever had.  I would recommend One Financial to everyone.,5
A George,"Called them about a loan and after providing income details and even having a co-app we were denied for the loan. We had sufficient income too, Highly recommend using a different company for a loan as these people just want to profit off you and rip you off. Spoke to Montavious and he said there should be no problem but denies us the next day, very unhelpful .",5

Paul Wilson,"I have dealt with the One Main branch in North Platte Nebraska for several years with a couple of different loans and I feel they are truly great!

I have called this company with no where else to turn during financial need and they have been there for me. I highly recommend this company and staff!!",5
Tony B,The biggest issue seem to be the lack of communication from the staff members. It took multiple calls  by me to get status updates. Had to go in person because I was blind and I had to have my husband sign papers.,5
James R,it was  a real easy process to go threw they did a grate job thanks,4

Gracemary,"We have wanted to begin paying our mortgage after being in forebearance. We have been in contact and spoken with several people since July. We were told that they would be rewriting the loan. Although we receive their mailings at our at our current address, our loan package was sent to a previous adress in another state. We were told that it would be resent and it wasn't. Two different people promised it would be corrected and it hasn't been.  We were also promised a phone comfirmation and that didn't happen. After begging for months for an avenue that would allow us to make payments, they reported that we were a year behind on our morgage payments and reported it the the credit bureau. It has ruined our credit. We tried to be a new car and couldn't because of that one hit on our credit. We wrote to the CEO and his executive staff and received no response. The only things we know to at this point to request intervention from a government agency or take legal action. We have damaged financially.",5

I was told due to the state the loan was taken out of Is why..but even after speaking to a rep from the actual company they said there was nothing they could do.. that $200. Interest they charged for paying it off early could had been used for Christmas for my grandson we adopted..And they just repeat themselves over and over how there is nothing they can do about it other then make you pay extra for paying them off sooner!,5

Bombas Customer,I called the location to start my loan literally minutes after they opened at 9:03 am. Sat in their parking lot until 10:30 since they were apparently in meetings. When I didn’t get a call back I called them to hear that the person handling my loan was on the other line and they would have him call me back. I continued to sit in the parking lot and wait. Every half hour I called back until I finally reached someone at 1:30 pm. They stated it would be just another minute and they would contact me to get started. I continued to call every half hour until 3pm when I got frustrated and walked in. They started my loan then told me to go wait outside again since another customer had just walked in and needed their attention. I went back outside and waited until 430 when I came back in. They finally finished my loan at 530pm. I literally sat at one main my entire day. I had to drive 65 miles to get there. Then 65 miles home. Not my best loan experience. They wouldn’t even let me use their restroom when I told them I’d been waiting literally seven hours for service.,5
Jerry R,"I appreciate One Main, but this last time was very frustrating.  I had a scheduled time and though I was there early, my loan officer was very late getting to me. Then during our time, they were not only working with me. It was not the level of customer service I have had in the past.",5

When he found my paperwork, I was bombarded with questions about needing more money than I requested, if I wanted to use my vehicle as collateral, which I already told him I didn't. Then I was transferred to a manager, I guess, and went through the same bombardment as I went through with the agent. Had I not already been approved, I would have gone somewhere else.",5

Victor Tyler,"My experience with one main has been the worst, to the point where i have to get a lawer, they repo my dads truck yesterday at wal mart left them on foot, when we got the loan i put in for collateral a truck witch one main bought from the bank because i still owed 17,000 on the truck, it was valued for 14,000 three years ago, with interest of 18.19 we paid three years straight 640 monthly on truck, well the 17,000 never went down on till this day they want to tell me that i still owe 17,000!!!!! i asked for a pay off on truck loan and i told the lady three to four times that it was for the truck loan, she told me yes maam she looked it up and she read me the information on her screen witch was the trucks information then i asked her why has the amount owed not gotten down if i had been paying for three years, she didnt know what to answer me because she was also confused, then she told me about the pay off payments tht i might approve for it and that she would just have to verify with her manager, i said ok later on that day she called me back that they had ok the three payments of 1500 for three months and i would be done with that loan, i repeated myself again three times to make sure it was the trucks she assured me that it was and she went over the information about the truck agian,so i was so happy because finally this nightmare was going to be over, after gaving two payments they call me and tell me that the truck was getting repo becouse of none payment!!! i told them and sent my recipient to them, well they put them toward my other loan that i paid 250! why would i pay on the smallest one instead  of the big loan? they had no answer the lady that set up the payments and told me false information would not answer my calls and everytime i asked to talk to her she denied my calls, so i talked to the repo manager and this is what she told me ""why would we agree on three payments of 1500 when you still owe 17,000 she said no way i asked her why i still owed the same as of when i stared three years ago, she also did not know what to say, so i asked her to investigate the calls please by this time i was in tears because my husband had lost his job due to covid i have three kids, house, bills, food, and car payments to pay on my own, that is why i was so happy and relieved that one less was going to go away, but no they did not care of my situation and the fact that i struggled so much to pay the two payments of 1500, i asked whats next she said they where going to hear the conversations and i had with both ladys telling me about the truck, she even told me in a very rude way that if they called me and i did not answer THE FRIST TIME they called that they would discontinue the investigation unless i got back with them right away and that she didnt know when i would get that call she gave me in between three days frame, i told her i work i cant be attached to my phone during work hours, she did not care at pretty much saying not her problem so what i did i would call twice a day for those three days and who ever would answer had no information at all about the case! so i did not hear from them at all those three days and till this day i still dont know anything, ALL I KNOW IS THAT THEY TOOK THE TRUCK, WHEN ALL THIS MESS WAS THERE FAULT TO BEGIN WITH! I ALSO LOST MY JOB DUE TO COVID MY HUSBAND AND I ARE UNEMPLOYED and one main has caused me so much stress this COUPLE of months an the last three years being with them have been the worst experienced i have ever had in my life, NEVER AGAIN!!!!! its ok god has not LEFT OUR SIDE IN THIS VERY DIFFICULT times our family is going through and i am sure he will also put in my path the right lawyer that will help us, i CAN'T sleep just thinking of this horrible situation my stress level is so high,they did not even let my parents take their belongings out of the truck, not even a notice they walked all wal marts parking lot looking for the truck and my mom has just gotten a total knee replacement recently thy are older, kind people, NEVER  HAVE I EVER KNOWN PEOPLE TO BE SO UNCONCETERATE  OF OTHERS, I DID MY PART BUT FOR A COMPANY TO STEAL MONEY OR ROB THEM BLIND IS NOT OK, ESPECIALLY IF WE TRIED TO DO THE RIGHT THING!!",5

I was already a customer of OMF and my loan specialist, Gladys Palacios was excellent. After coming into the office to sign papers the original amount I was told I could  to borrow went down. Even though with the the lower offer it worked out great. If it had not of been for the extra mile Mrs. Palacios provided me by requesting more from the lienholders even after the decision came back, I would have not had a second quote which helped me out tremendous. So Thank You Gladys .. on going that extra mile even after I overheard the other ladies in the office doubt the approval and had it been them wouldn't have tried, you got it because you tried and I cant thank you enough. Thanks for being that breath of fresh air in the staleness.",5

Aliyahsmom,The process was quick and easy. I applied online/the response was immediate. I had my doubts because I’ve been hacked before AND my credit was less than 600. So to have such a quick response was scary for me. But I continued on/the worker was courteous (but so are hackers LOL) he asked me questions/he said come in/I was floored but it had to be real. I went to the office OMG! It was real! He offered three options/advised payments/I thought about it/and went with the higher amount. I was crying because I had so many bills that needed to pay pronto!!!I thank God because this was an answer to prayer! Not gonna lie! I enjoyed every minute of spending the money on bills! It’s been quite a while since i had that much money to spend. And here’s the beauty of it: 17% interest over a 5 year payment plan. AWESOME! Process and worker,5

Joe thoroughly explained to me the Home & Auto and Silver plans that I had to enable me to better understand what coverage I had.  Nessa and Joe combined did a great job for me today!

They told me that they needed my car info in the case that i totalled my car, that they would receive some payment towards the loan. I had NO IDEA they were moving my loan from my current bank to their lying, cheating, disgusting interest mongering bank. When i called to speak with the office manager, he said ""Well, you signed all the papers"", and then wouldnt accept anymore of my calls, or return them. SOOO glad i got my money out of there, and would warn anyone else to stay away,,,as a matter of fact RUN!!!!",5

Dana Haney,"As a renewal customer, I appreciated being able to handle the entire application process, and ultimately have the funds deposited into my account, digitally, rather than having to traipse to Staten Island to present documents and sign papers (as I had done five years earlier).    In a series of phone calls and e-mails, representatives explained the procedures, some of which were unfamiliar and difficult to me.  Overall, the representatives were polite and helpful, and we got the job done.  Occasionally, representatives seemed exasperated with my confusion or took it as lack of willingness to cooperate, and suggested I either come in person or withdraw my application.  In fact, I set up an in-person appointment, but was later called by a much more helpful representative whom I knew only as ""Mark,"" who guided me through all the stages.",5

Lisa R,Everything was cool with associates Porsha & Teran being their usual delightful selves but James never spoke to me to my knowledge & Chris seemed peeved I was revoking the new loan & remaining with my old one. I was never even offered a seat the entire time I was there & that was like at least 30 minutes & I was tired & have lupus. Maybe James & Chris were having off moments but I really think my changing my mind about a loan didn't sit well.,5

You are definitely a credit to your industry and a great resource for the people of Belvidere.",5
Franklin S,"The process of getting a loan through OneMain is incredibly simple. I recently re financed and was literally able to complete everything all in one day.

So when they called from the mason city office I told him I wasn’t happy that he went behind my back and told my insurance I needed full coverage. He replied Oh no you don’t I will get ahold of them” BAM WHAT COMRS IN MTHE MAIL TODAY A BILL FOR FULL COVERAGE ON MY CAR.,5
James P,"Great experience! Simple, fast, and very friendly staff.",5
Ms.Keke,The OneMain Financial co I am dealing with did not give me clarity as to Why I was given an interest rate SO much higher than 75% of customers or people with similar credit scores according to the credit rating based on vantage score 3.0. And based on all of our household income. So many offerings sent to receive additional money. Interest rate is awful. We are faithful in making monthly payments and borrowed in faith expecting the APR to be extremely fair and yet do not understand why more interest was deducted and received by company at the beginning of payments? COVID-19 has causes us to inquire and ask about payments. Still discombobulated in comparison to what advertisements says.,5
Derek M,"I was excelente, i am very thank you,",5
Agustin R,I was approved for a loan yesterday and I cannot say enough about the Bryan store in Texas. From the very beginning (phone Call) I have never had such professional people treat me the way that the trainee and the new manager treated me.

Jose D,"I've used One Main Financial while living in my previous home and they've always been so helpful in a time of need.

Edwin P,"RUN!!!!!!! Do yourself a favor and avoid this fraudulent company at all cost. Not only does OneMain do unauthorized withdrawals from your account after they receive their payoff. They do not communicate within the organization as one. Extremely poor service and zero effort to fix a problem they created. They place a 14 day hold on the funds before returning and give zero Sh!@t about you as a customer…...Oh did I mention I called two weeks prior to the due date to cancel the payment. They documented my conversation as wanting to do another loan, because extremely high interest rates are awesome lol.",5

David Collins,"Auto Loan, Everything went very well.",5
Patricia R,"I'm convinced these reviews are lies. I was approved for a rate and sent congratulations documents etc. The software would send me automated requests for documents I already submitted, automated request and told there is a link in my email and there wasn't an e-mail. Instead of the company contacting me and saying there was an error, which I've never been denied before, but I had to contact them and was told that I was not approved. Wasted my time and I could have went with another company immediately instead of wasting my time going back and forth with this company. They wanted me to use my car as collateral. Negative! I've never had to and the loan amount didn't warrant it. So, not a professional experience.",5

Mary C,"I received an email for me to apply for a loan, I completed a pre approval that stated I was pre approved for a secured loan up to a certain amount. I work for a very large financial institution so I am very familiar with terms and conditions. When I received the email for pre approval it states if I want to move forward with application to click on ""submit application"" button. Once submitting it displayed I was approved and need addt verification information. When receiving the email it ask for a car title for so I called and spoke with a agent who advised me that I would need a car title in order to move forward with the application, I advised the agent I did not see anywhere before applying that I would need that or I would not have applied. I do have a vehicle but it is not registered in my name. I asked the agent if I could have the hard inquiry removed from my credit and she transferred me to the credit bur department that was closed. The next day an agent name ERIC from the Lil Creek location in Norfolk, VA  called me and asked if I wanted to move forward with the application, so I explained to him the same thing I explained to the agent the following day. ERIC begins to tell me that I misunderstood or I over read it.  When trying to explain to ERIC he continued to over talk me and attempt to rush me off the phone. When asking ERIC if he could allow me to opportunity to speak he continued to over talk me and I requested for a Supervisor when I got Keira Lewis who got on the phone and did not one time acknowledge my concerns or show anytime of empathy. She came on the call with the same intentions as the previous agent and that was to place blame. I do not work for ONE MAIN FIN and I do not know the policy or terms for the institution. No where within my email was there a disclosure that advised I needed a car with a title in my name to apply for that loan! I would like the hard inquiry to be removed from my credit report and I am now happy that I don't do business with a company who has such unprofessional associates, I am dissatisfied will how I was treated. The moment that I said I did not want to move forward the agent did not care about anything else I had to say. I should have known anyway by the amount of phone calls I received asking me to continue applying!",5

Craig,"I moved and my loan was transferred to Surprise AZ. I applied for a 2nd loan to pay off loan #1 at a lower percentage. I provided all of the documents she asked for. I kept getting emails to provide what I had already provided. After several of those, I left a voicemail stating to withdraw my application. The next day I got an email from branch mgr Virginia for documents. I called. I was speaking and she spoke over me. I told her I am still speaking. She had the nerve to say to me that I am being unprofessional! I educated her that I dont have to be 'professional' since I am not working and I am the client. She is working and SHE needs to be professional. She accused me of cursing at her. I had not. She stated she would deny my application. NO she doesnt have that power and I asked to withdraw. The app is sent somewhere else. She hung up on my call at least 5 times. 2 days ago a police officer came to my home sent by her. He was amused and told me he knew I had no intentions of going there. Why would I? Not only do I NOT want to do business with her or One Main Mess, but you cant deal with a snowflake. She doesnt have any financial background as she was a clerk in a pharmacy previously.",5

Dewey C,"I was approved for a loan.  I was told you have 7 days to cancel the loan with no issues.  Well,  I called 2 days after I accepted the loan to cancelled. I asked if I could return the loan money deposited in my account and was told yes but I needed to return the car payoff money as well.  I inquired further of how to do that.  I was informed that a stop payment could not be done.  I would have to intercept the check mailed to the previous lender.  I was told the previous lender could not mail it back and all of this needed to be done within the 7 day window.  No further guidance was provided and I felt overwhelmed.  I asked when would the check arrive to the lender, I was told “ummm we don’t know.” So, things aren’t as easy as they said it would be.  I feel I was mislead and their policy of the 7 days was false advertisement.  I am now stuck with paying off a loan that i no longer want.  I changed my mind and was told before I signed the documents I had this option.  I was emailed that I could cancel at anytime during the 7 days.   So don’t believe the 7 day rule…it’s a lie!!!  I updated my comment because it wasn’t clear.  But I hope this provides some clarity.  I will pay this loan i am stuck with in less than 6 months and will never do business with one main ever again and will not recommend due to this company being deceptive.",5

Anonymous,"The young lady who handled my account was very helpful and understanding of what I was going through. She stopped to listen to me and went well out of her way to remove the “itch” of panic from my system. Where the two banking institutions that I have been dealing with for more years than I care to remember, would not even consider me for what I was asking for, one of them said,” you are living on 64.134% of your income now so we can’t help you at this time!!!!” I can’t thank you and her enough for the faith and patients to help me in my time of need and I do/will recommend this institution to anyone else who has a need for your services!!!!…🙏🏿💯👍🏿🙌🏿",5

DD Russell ,"I have worked with OneMain for years and when I say years I mean close to 7 years. This is the last loan I will ever refinance with them. It was like they couldn’t get their *bloop* together and have a lot unrealistic standards that have been put in place in the last year and a half. I stood in line at the courthouse to get a stamp on child support papers that were signed by the judge, because they “needed” the stamp. I had to submit my child's birth certificate because her birth date was not listed on the papers. They didn’t count about $1900/mo in income because “it didn’t count”so the “system” was telling them my debt to income ratio was not optimal. This loan would have saved me $500/mo, but oh well. I guess the “system” knows my financial situation better than I do. This was the most disappointing refinancing I have had with them. Despite that, I love One Main!",5

On Tuesday I called and the lady was rude with me and said someone would call me back I tried to tell her that's what was said on Monday. Tuesday evening I went up to the and was told to come back on Wednesday and the manager would close on my loan. He never gave me a time until I called at 1:00 to see if it was another delay and he said he would meet with me at 4:30. I have had loans there before but never with so much delay and no calls back. The manager said it was because they were so short handed and so busy. I had a water leak and water was running for 3 days.,3

Linda T,"I would not recommend this company. I am in the military and currently stationed in Guam. I applied for a loan through this company as I had gotten a pre-approval letter from them. I used my parents California address as my address here in Guam could not be excepted. Over the course of 3 days I spoke with a representative and submitted all documentation needed to get approved and funded for the loan. I was told I was approved and given all loan information. When I called on the 3rd day to finalize my loan, I was told my information was still being reviewed. I waited on the line for a bit and the lady I was speaking with came back on and told me they just needed to verify my address. She asked if I had any proof of residence such as a bill and I explained I don’t currently live at that address but I can provide mail from there. She then asked what my actual address was and I provided my Guam address. She then put me on hold and when she came back told me there was nothing she could do for me and I could no longer get the loan because I was not currently living in California. I told her I could provide a bill in my name from that address but she stated “it’s too late, because we already know you don’t actually live here”. So after being approved, submitting all paperwork and even having proof of residence I was not afforded the loan. I’m my opinion this is crap. I had proof of residence and just because I do not currently live in California I shouldn’t have been denied the loan. I would not recommend this company or apply for a loan through them ever again. Beware!!",5

Rich and Anne,I would have never applied for a loan if the minimum value of the vehicle being used for collateral had been disclosed. After I applied I was told my car value was $200 short. Since I had the hard inquiry on my credit my brother offered to co-sign. Because of this One Main changed my loan offer and said they would have to refinance my brother’s existing loan. They wanted to add my loan to my brother’s loan and exponentially raise his interest rate. What?!? It is so unheard of I thought I misunderstood. Nope. They really wanted to make me responsible for my brother’s loan as well as raise his interest because my loan would be included. I am still in shock. Who does that?!?,5

If I found my paid workers were treating my customers like they did!!!Anyway to end this story I gave them 3-great cars that are paid off for collateral and they said they couldn’t get me anything so I went elsewhere and got my loan for 17apr interest and a new 2018 Mercedes Benz 300 4matic I’m a HAPPY CAMPER Now!!!!

Dusha Soul,"I had a loan with Beneficial before they were purchased by OneMain. My interactions via the website were frequently painful. I even had trouble paying off my loan early. The site rejected my payment. Even after several bad experiences, I considered getting a consolidation loan through them only to learn that they no longer allow customers to use home equity as collateral. While I understand this (partially) from a business perspective, I've never seen it first-hand and was quite disappointed. Now, collateral has to be in the form of a car or some other form. No, thanks!!! For many of us, real estate is the main source of collateral. And I found this interesting, since it was collateral before paying off our second mortgage. Terrible. Predatory. Unprofessional. Disappointing. Sayonara, OneMain. Never again!!!",5

Steven C,Communication was very tough during the entire process. Each call I am told something different. Even when calling in to clarify was difficult. I was never called back at the time I was told and ended up closing a week later. I was never updated on numbers until the end of the loan which was lower than I was told. Very frustrating process. The funds were deposited fast and that was all. Even when asking to do bi weekly it was put as monthly.,5

Patricia H,"I applied at this loan institution and received a loan. I was getting shot down at traditional banks. I want Georgia residents to be aware that I was told it was company policy that regardless of credit history, GA residents receive 35% interest and 35% is what I was charged. Thinking this was an extreme rate I looked up GA statute,  GA Code § 7-4-2 (2017) . And it says the ""(a) (1) (A) The legal rate of interest shall be 7 percent per annum simple interest where the rate percent is not established by written contract."" So even though this company did give me a loan they ( IN MY OPINION)Should be used as a last resort.",5

John L,"We were approved for an unsecured loan.   From the get go, we provided them with all documentation and made this clear.  They had provided us with both an unsecured and secured options.  We didn't want a secured loan,  as it was just temporary, to get us through a brief time of tight finances.  We voiced these things to them; told us everything was set to sign; set up an appointment, that they attempted to cancel on us, while we were in the parking lot; and then told us everything would take longer because they needed to search out more options that they could offer with secured loans.  We again,  tried to voice that we were disinterested in a secured loan.   They seem disinterested in helping people and have extremely high interest rates (30%).  Credit cards have better rates.   Our credit isn't bad, and we were just approved for a refinance  at 2.65% interest rate.   This place is an unprofessional joke.  If negative stars were an option,  they would get a -10 stars.  I've never dealt with such a poor and sleazy business.  We're taking our business elsewhere.  Word to the wise,  just because an overall financial institution provides high ratings, doesn't mean that the individual branches produce those results.  Look into your local financial branches,  as well.  That's one mistake that I'll never make again.",5

Cathly T,"Extremely disappointed with the way the Executive Office of Customer Care handled my complaint. I was misinformed by an employee from one of there branches with the end result being a late payment on my credit report. Granted I have never been late with any payments with this company, or any company at that. I was told by one of their reps I would be able to defer a payment after explaining to them I just started a new job and my pay schedule is a bit off. They offered me a later date to make my payment and my question to them was ""If I do this deferment will this affect my credit score? if so ill rather just bite the bullet and make the payment"" The rep said ""NO this deferment is in place to avoid that very scenario"". That was False. I am currently trying to dispute this matter which will probably go nowhere because the calls between customers and the branches are NOT recorded. (side note if making any arrangements you should self record the conversation because it'll be your word against theirs). Extremely disappointed.",5

I have a question  about the mandate of  electronic checking when the previous loan was set up and handled by a hand written routing number and a bank statement. In my opinion I believe that  in consideration of all payments being on time and without incident there should have been no reason to  require this but to grandfather it in. It  cost me a trip and another day. I have to say I was planning on starting on line banking  anyway  just feel it shouldn't have been required at that time. Could someone give me insight on this necessity? Overall  I was pleased and I got what was needed.",5

If I choose to do business with OneMain in the future, I do not want to work with this agent.",5
Marley Slotkin,"Communication between your representative and customer should always be complete and professional. The representative “J” first did not inform me that they had relocated offices to an unnumbered building with no signage. Made it difficult to locate as well a find parking once I did identify the building. She also kept referring to me an “Hun” or “Love” which I find demeaning and I know other people will as well. I have many years of working with customer experience teams and this should be rectified. Address the customer by name, preferably Mr or Mrs. unless otherwise directed.  It shows respect.",5

I was impressed with how easy it was to sign online from home after less than 30 minutes of applying and the next day my check was deposited into my bank account. I had a great experience  with OneMain Financial, so much easier!Doug C.",5

Due to the way my pay stubs are set up through my employer, which is once a month but we can option for a flat rate bi-monthly and my pay stub list it as an advance, by doing this it seemed that the bottom line monthly amount wasn’t sufficient for the loan. Tina Scott (Branch manager) worked very diligently in making sure and explaining how my pay stubs were set up and that I did qualify for this loan.",5

Mary M,Where do I start? I got into the office and was helped by one girl. She sat us at the computer and told us she would be right back. Then 30 mins later we watch her walk out the door and told her co workers she was going to let her dogs out. So then we got another lady helping us. We sat in a room for 3 hours without anyone coming to work with us. We never finished paperwork til after they closed because they were not helping us. But that is not all. After filling out the loan and getting the check a week later I went to the DMV to get tags for the car i bought OneMain  still had not brought the title to the DMV. I called and was told the manager has not brought the title to the DMV because she was off. It had been a whole week why did it take me calling to get someone to bring the title to my car to the DMV. The girl who told me she was bringing it to the DMV said she would call after she brought it and she never called me. So i am wasting money on insurance for a car i can not put in my name since this company will not bring my stuff to the DMV. The pervious owner cant take the car off his policy until the tags are turned in but cant turn the tags in without the title changing names.. DO NOT RECCOMEND!!,5

I put her off to secure the second half of my roof cost from a family member.  She continues to harass and Followup, again no worries just doing her job. Loan sharking @ 26% is a business, I was willing to pay due to the need for a new roof!  Finalizing paperwork and she tells me that I don’t qualify.  ???  These are the same exact numbers we talked about when you approved me a week ago!!  Now I still only have half my roof cost.  These people are ridiculous!!  Do not go through the stress!",5

Tracey W,"I am a returning customer since 2012 and have an excellent payment history with OneMain Financial, Albemarle, NC branch, good credit, low debt and long term employment that I've had to take a TEMPORARY medical leave from. Even though I am still employed and receiving short term benefits and returning to work in 2 months, I recently applied for a unsecured personal loan (my 5th time with this company) and was surprisingly denied. The young man assisting me with the application was very nice and professional but appeared to lack knowledge of other options that could have been considered and offered to me in order to get an approval. So, with a credit rating down 3 points, I had to go elsewhere for the personal loan. (Other options were offered by a different lender and my application was approved in 30 minutes, by the way) At a time when so many people are really in need, I find it so sad that loyalty and good-standing obviously means nothing with some businesses even though statements like the following are on their websites:""We’re not like other lendersBecause you’re not like any other customer. You have your own unique questions, needs and goals. That’s why we look at more than your traditional credit score. And we’ll work together to help you find not just any financial solution, but one that works for you.""",5

Raymond W,I thought it was kind of weird that when I got there and sign all the loan papers that you didn’t get the check that day they ACH to your bank account. The problem that I had is that they were supposed to ACH to pay my car off and here it is September 7th and it’s been since August 28 and my car still isn’t paid off and my payment is due today. I called the branch yesterday and Joyce said give it 10 more days which makes me nervous. I don’t pay anything late. I don’t want that on my record because you guys can’t seem to figure out how to ACH my car loan to pay it off. I will not do this again.,5

Richard O,"I was very off put by Danielle who was assisting me with a loan application in a Virginia branch. The phone ID said from Falls Church, VA but I don’t see any One Main Financial branches in Falls Church.  Since I did apply for a loan with this company I wasn’t worried cause I know many people work from home right now. Anyways, I was told I could get a loan and then after submitting financial documents I was told they couldn’t loan the full amount anymore. I applied with my husband and so that seemed strange. We provided more information and then today I was told we couldn’t be serviced any longer. It was very abrupt and when I asked for a reason I was told an issue with paystubs. My husband and I both provided those so this felt like an excuse. After asking for specifics I was simply told sorry but the loan can’t be processed at this time. Now I’m just annoyed with the situation. Sudden changes between each phone call with new stories and situations and then all to get denied for a reason they couldn’t verify? Not impressed with this company.",5

Walter J,Lisa at the Hiram ga  branch was an absolute joy and if it wasn't for her I would have turned right around and walked out. At the time I needed the funds but I very nearly declined because they based the loan on credit rating from Experian at I think 489 when it was actually 604 and I pulled it up right there in front if the branch manager who stated that wouldn't matter and since they already had it written up she wasn't going to change the interest rate. She said take it or leave it. Since I was basically under pressure I had no choice. Now let's just see if anybody corrects that.,5

Patrick S,"I had terrible experience. Everything started great. I had applied for financing on the dealers website. A day later I was advised by the dealer that I was approved. The salesman at the dealer provided me with loan details such as rate, term, and payment. I accepted it. I advised  the dealer I would return 5 days later to process the paperwork and sign for my new motorcycle. The rep from the dealer advised me to call OMF to make sure there wasn't anything the bank needed. When I called I had a pleasant conversation with a OMF representative. He advised that he needed additional info and I immediately supplied the docs that he needed. He advised that had everything. Great! I advised the OMF rep that I would be heading over to the dealer on a Saturday, and the OMF rep informed me that they would be ready to finalize the loan on that day. On a Friday the OMF rep called me and said that he had everything ready to finalize on Saturday, he advised me of the times that he would be available. So I arrived at the dealer on Saturday at 11:30am, I spoke with my salesman, he brought out the bike I was interested in. I went for a quick test drive and then I told the salesman let do the paperwork.  I knew I was going to buy the bike. Nothing changed as far as price and terms. We started the purchase oder around 12pm. John the salesman had all the paper work in order. I signed everything and he uploaded the info to OMF's online portal. John had a hard time reaching OMFs reps, to confirm the paperwork and review. 3 hours later OMF finally reviewed the paperwork then put me on hold for an additional 30 minutes to go over the loan agreement. When showing me the loan agreement the numbers were wrong. OMF had informed the dealer how to submit a PO to them but OMF got the numbers wrong. So I had to wait another 30 minutes for OMF to make corrections. I was at the dealer for 4 hours waiting on OMF to handle the process. After what I thought was going to be a streamline process since they had everything as far as my docs. The dealer advised they would never use OMF on another customer and I for sure will not take another loan from OMF again.",5

Venita B,"My experience from beginning to end was absolutely amazing!! The only issue I experienced was trying to upload my documents. After several attempts, I just called the office and they said that this had been happening to several people. So they just said come on to my appointment and they would do everything there. They were just trying to keep me from having to be there for a long period time. But, the whole process didn't take long at all. I recommend to anyone who is looking to consolidate (as I did), or whatever your financial needs are, to definitely make OneMain Financial your one and only choice.",5

Bryan L,Overall I would say my experience was just ok. The rep assigned to me was not empathetic to the fact that I was at work at the time of her calling me. When I asked if there was anyway I could call back when I was on my lunch break she proceeded to tell me that she was not going to be around at that time and therefore we had to finish at that very moment. This was very inconvenient for me being that I had several patients to assist at work and therefore I had to put the rep on hold a few times in order to tend to my patients and felt forced and rushed through the entire process. When I got back on the line it sounded as if the rep felt like i was bothering and inconveniencing her. The rep's tone of voice was not welcoming or friendly.,5

Charles S,"Today I went into the office because after repeated attempts to talk to someone on the phone, nobody is getting it. I have a loan through one main. Never been late, have actually, always been ahead of schedule. Recently I was off on medical leave. I forgot that I had insurance that covered my payments. Made a call and got paperwork filled out and sent back into the office. The girl I talked to stopped my automatic deductions out of my account. Well I hadn’t heard back, so I called and she said as soon as she heard anything she would call me. In the meantime, they keep trying to deduct money out of my account causing overdrafts. 4 to be exact. If I’ve applied for my disability through you why would you do that? I call back…. She said she put another stop on it. So today when I go into the office…. They basically tell me that I hadn’t made any of these calls. They have no record of them. And yes they back paid me for my payments, kinda…. They paid themselves! Thanks.",5

I also met Mark, her assistant for the first time. and he is as real as he sounds on the phone.  It's a joy to do business with this Bardstown location, even though I have a local office where I live, I will travel 50 miles r/t just to wok with them.

Carolyn Green,"Great agents! Ehh process!The agent(s) that I worked with were great!! They were knowledable and helpful. Also apologetic when they had to have me leave three different times because of needing different information.The reason for the average rating is simple~~your company makes it very difficult for someone that has a PO Box for a maiiing address to get a loan. I have received mail at the PO box for over two years now but it wasn't good enough hence the reason I had to leave three different times. ALSO, my car titie, which was issued with your company name, was not good enough for my physical address which was printed on the front of the title. That being good enough would have made the loan process so much quicker and saved me a lot of gas and trouble having to go and get something else with the physical address. Something you all should really consider using.Again, Agents great! Process not so much!Karren Mitchell",5
Jesus G,"It was incredible, described all. The opposition that pertain to your company. Thank you for outstanding job.",5
Michael Gallagher,"Tina at the Catonsville branch was amazing. The entire process took less than 24 hrs. from the beginning  phone call through having the funds deposited in my account. Tina was very professional, courteous and took me through the whole process from the first phone call to the last signature. That lady deserves a raise. I would send anyone that was looking for a loan, One Main Financials way because off how your employee (Tina), represented your company and treated me as a person not just another customer in a long line of customers.",5

Took over 3 weeks to complete my loan, original loan processor went on vacation with no notification to me leaving my credit to be double pulled as well as my entire loan to be redone by someone else, and my loan amount changed from original pre approval.

Timothy P,Working with OneMain Financial was a dream. Everyone was very helpful and courteous. Easiest loan process I’ve ever experienced. Funds deposited within minutes of approval. The only negative was a $300 fee they don’t tell you about. Their  interest rate was high even for my credit rating. But I needed the money and they were there when I needed them.,5

I was also glad to see my interest rate approximately 4-5 interest rate points lower than my previous loan. My money was probably transferred into my account for a mediate use. The only thing was when both Persons left the room seemed to be a bit long of a wait, that’s my only negative part of the process but overall it was fine",5

Joey G,I received a loan from your company for 4000. Only got to keep 900 because some balances had to be paid first which was fine. What I don't like is that my loan officer told me these balances would be paid in a week. Well after the second week I called your office and a different loan officer told me it takes 2-3  weeks. This is not good customer service. Please make sure your loan officers are giving out correct information. Thanks,5

Vanya K,"Amazing company. The whole loan process took 2 days to complete and they tell you your money will be loaded in about 2 hours and I had mine direct deposited to my debit card in 45 minutes. I also didn’t have to make a payment until 2 MONTHS after the loan was received, which was amazing I really had time to get my financial situation sorted out before having to worry about making another payment towards something. Highly recommend. And the best part is you don’t even have to have amazing credit to qualify for this loan",5
Victoria P,"Carlos in the Corsicana, TX office was very professional yet relatable. He wasn't ""pushy"". I was approved for a higher amount than I needed. Which gave me the opportunity to take care of some additional things; but I wasn't sure exactly how much I needed. He told me to think on it and get back with him. I appreciated that. Paperwork was seamless and user friendly, he guided me through each document and wasn't impatient when I choose to read some documents a little closer. Overall, a great experience.",5
Janie R,"I needed a loan for a car. I got approved pretty much on the spot. But, let's just say it took a day. I was assisted by Jessica. Who in my opinion is second to none.

Richard S,Excellent service. Very courteous and fast. Was in and out within an hour and my needs were fulfilled.,5
Tangie H,The representative that assisted with my loan was great until it came time to receive funds. He attempted to send to my debit card and that failed. They attempted direct deposit (ach) and that failed. Then they cut a check and it still hasn’t posted due to some sort of failure of them to release funds to my bank. This info is according to my financial institution. It will now be an additional week before funds are posted. The representative that assisted me received minimal to no help from higher up. I appreciate the fact that he attempted to assist but the failure to make my funds available in a timely manner is what drives my 1 star rating.,5
Hubert J,Very smooth process and friendly agent. Overall experience very good,5

Tom T,"Over all, I'd say an easy process. I work non-stop, so it's hard for me to go in places. I love that I was able to do this all over the phone and online. I got my loan money the next day, I was able to immediately consolidate as much debt as possible. The terms are pretty okay, the rate could be better but my credit is pretty bad at the moment after a several years of bad luck I'm rebuilding my life now. I like that there's the option to refinance and it could lower my interest rate, at a later point as my score improves. Staff is super friendly and definitely helpful. I'd certainly recommend this place. The mobile app is great, I can keep track of my loan and make payments from there, and with auto pay I don't have to worry. If I forget, it will sort itself out. It truly was a blessing and honestly, I don't think I'd be able to achieve my goals for the future without this assistance and I genuinely do appreciate this help. It feels like a second chance at life and has really made rebuilding from all the struggles so much easier and faster. Thank you, OneMain Financial.",5

Assistant manager Elaine G. Was wonderful. We touched base on my desired needs and whether I needed something short term or a little longer. The whole experience was awesome.

Julianne Ciechoski,At One Main they understand people with low credit scores deserve a chance to improve their scores by giving them a loan. Thank you for taking a chance on us we won’t let you down!,1
Francis D,I found this loaner on credit karma. And I can definitely misleading/ possible scam. I questioned the one rep about the preapproval. I got approved for 12k and 17k if I put my car up for collateral. When I was talking to the guy he kept asking me about my financial situation. He went as far to asking me for my awards letter. When I said I got approved for the 12k without he said no most we can give you without that letter is 8k. I declined the offer and told him I do not have a computer at the moment to even send him the awards letter. Not once was the approval of 8k was mentioned on the site. And they were directly connected to my bank accounts. When I got off the phone I thought it over and decided to send the award letter via cellphone. Once received the rep told me he will call me before 3pm with the amount I should receive it’s now 7pm. And didn’t receive that phone call. So I went online to check my status and in clear writing I was denied. I don’t know what they are looking for but I would watch out because to me this is personal information you are basically throwing at them as well as what you have on hand in your accounts. I hate that reps for this company are out there lying about approvals. I will never reapply with this company again. Then for running my credit by the way before receiving all my information that was a red flag on its own,5
Tanya Hunt,"I had a great experience very fast,very very friendly, I will highly recommend them to my friends and coworkers, Thank you  !",5
Maurice Smith,"I can go on and on about the technicality of this company, like how they are easy to contact, have great online account management, and good loan products. But i would really like to focus on the customer service experience.COVID aside, the last two years have been hell for me. Between crippling depression, having to move in the middle of a pandemic, skyrocketting student loan payments, and now a stroke, I have struggled to keep my account current. Historically, I have had issues with controlling my finances. I dont have the best credit and recently learned that is because i apparently have ADHD. Long story short, each time I have called this company they have offered solutions to keep my account current. Sometimes that means a change in loan terms like extending the length of the loan, or having to make double payments, but they have always given me an option to get my account and my life back on track. And not once has a rep pressured me or tried to force me into something.When I am depressed i tend to focus on basic needs and let everything else fall to the wayside while i focus on keeping my head above water.I had a stroke a few months ago and called today to figure out what i could do about my account that was 6 months past due fully expecting that they would simply write off my loan because it wasnt the first, second, or third time I asked for help.Dontcha know the woman on the other line empathised with me, cut my payment in half, and gave me new loan terms I could work with while I pay off ER bills.Not once have I ever called this company and was made to feel less than because I couldnt pay my bills. Not once were they unwilling to help me. I swear by this company. If you are on the fence about loan products from them, give them a chance.",5
Xavier,"Great experience,very polite agent assisted me.will recommend anyone to try one main financial.happy customer",5
Monica B,"Fast, easy process and funds were delivered the next day",5
Frances D Featherston,Waste of time! They want several documents sent up front and did not even screen my particulars until after they got them. Then I had to call them and answer questions they had directly in front of them. They hold everything against you to include cars that other folks pay for just because your a co-signer.  One car is a lease my sin pays and one is paid by my husband through his business account. Yet even though I’m a co-signer I get I could held responsible for them but then they could also be collateral .   I could have afforded the loan payment even though their rates are higher then others but wasn’t given the chance. The lady I spoke to did a lot of umms and okays and acted like she was hiding something and could see what she was looking for in my statements until after I answered her questions but she seemed nice.All I gotta say is why make someone send you all this documentation first before pulling a credit check when there’s no benefit from it.Just tell someone your approved or not approved.,5
Sharon Hollins,I wish all agencies were as nice and professional as they are including expeditious!,5
Amy Diaz,One main was responsive and fast helping us with a consolidation loan. The representative was amazing. Thank you!,5
Vin Rosé B,"I inquired about a loan on line, and Cindy called me.  ?She was very resourceful and helpful.  She was able to let me know right away what I could ask for, then she sent an email of the documentation I would need.  I was able to do everything on line without going to the office.  Once I was approved, Cindy called me back, at my convenience, and literally walked me through every step to complete the application.  And true to her word I had the money the next day.  My son is also a member of OneMain Financial. He is the one who had me apply in the beginning.  It is very helpful for unforeseen expenses.Sincerely, Teresa",5

Jamie R,"I applied for a small loan in early July. I worked with a guy name Lamont. He took me down a very long rabbit hole. I scanned all the documents he asked for except for my SS card which I had lost. After a month I was told by a new person, Vanessa that I had timed out and had to apply again. By this time I had received a new SS card and scanned that in. She told me scans were not acceptable and I had to take pictures with my mobile. By this time I was boiling mad. She did give me the number of a local office near Albany, N.Y. I talked to a gentleman named Mike. He had me approved and funds transferred to my checking account in less than half an hour. So five stars for Mike and none for Lamont and Vanessa. Very poor service from your central office.",5

Gary U,"The first person Jessica that I worked with was nice, but obviously extremely inexperienced. She told me I did qualify for a 10,000 dollar loan. She didn't tell me that I would also need to put full coverage insurance on my vehicle, that she used a roundabout estimate of my income that was much higher than the paystub I sent her, or that the qualification wasn't finalized. Then after having me drive an hour to get to her twice, she told me it was actually only a $3500 loan because she used a higher estimate of my income instead of the paystub that I initially told her I sent to her. I also caught covid and delayed our meeting by a couple of weeks and I wasn't informed the loan offer would expire and I'd need to give her more information. Not that it mattered because she didn't initially use my actual income for the qualification and she didn't tell me it wasn't an official offer. So after a week of headaches we canceled all of our plans and regretted spending the money we did over the past few weeks because we counted on her word. She then gave me 5 days to decide if I would take her new much lower offer and when I called I was told she was on vacation. The next guy I dealt with was super nice and walked me through closing and gave me the option to do it over the phone instead of driving an hour a third time to be there. He was also very thorough! I didn't need to use my car as collateral or jump through all the hoops she sent me through  and am much happier with the outcome despite being disappointed that a lot of plans were changed from counting on what we were told.",5

Zach Justice,One Main Financial doesn't deserve any stars!!!! This company is one of most discriminatory and racist companies i have ever seen!!!! They also tampered with my account without my consent are permission!!!! Which is a federal offense!!!! And their business procedures and practices are very corrupt and shady!!!!!! The people involved in this discriminatory and racist lawsuit as well as the account tampering and the harresment and inmidation tactics. The people involved in this scam and cover up is one Racist Customer Service supervisor Jackline Schrader and Onemain Financials executive team and also one of the higher executive team is Mark Kilchenstein Vice President/ Chief Customer Officer. He tried to use bully and intimidation letter tactics on me. And they wont work on me. He should be fired immediately!!!! He does not have the customer service skills to be in this leading position!!!!!!!Mark Kilchenstein Vice President/ Chief Customer Officer should be fired immediately for these charges!!!!! He is a total disgrace to this postion and Onemain Financial!!!!! And also Jackline Schrader Customer Service Supervisor should be fired immediately for her discriminatory and racist slurs she used on me and my account situations!!!!!These people are a total disgrace to thier postions and SHOULD BE FIRED IMMEDIATELY!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
Spencer L,They were very helpful thank you Theresa Vanek,5
Great customer,"Absolute waste of time. These folks actually pull an hard credit and approve everything then come around to make every excuse to take back their decision. They lied about how much my wife and I have in income and they decided to use my business income as the reason. All we was doing was consolidating our bills. If you use this company, right now is not the time to trust them to screw up your credit.",5
William M,So they do a hard pull on my credit and say I’m approved. But since I went back to being self employed this year and don’t have a full years tax return being self employed THIS year they decide to reverse their decision even when they go look at my deposits into my bank account for the last 3 years. And even tax returns from prior years showing employment. Absolute bs. Now I have a hard pull on my credit report for absolutely nothing. Thanks for wasting my time. How can you approve someone and then LATER ask for documents. I think you need those prior. Wouldn’t you? And mobile deposits don’t look as good as direct deposits. Apparently money isn’t money these days.,5
Jane Schier,This place is very worst place in the world customer service is bad horrible and greedy for money very high interest rate in the world and steel the personal information very bad experience with them never ever will be business again and never will recommend to any one please stay out of them if any one read this my review,5

Very easy to apply, and to get the money, and the payments will be auto-deducted from my checking account so I dont have any worries about remembering to make the payment.",5

Ann,"While I did ultimately go through with the loan, the experience was far less than pleasant.  I initially applied for a $12,000 personal loan.  When my application was going through, it was requested that I send more documents, verifying my income.  I called the local office and they told me that an award letter from my VA counselor would be perfect, as well as letting me know that as soon as I did that I would have the loan.  She confirmed the amount of $12,00 unsecured, but I could go with $18,000 if I wanted to put my car against it.  She stated that she was unable to email me the offers to review, which I should have taken as a red flag.  I sent in the letter from my VA counselor and was then informed that that half of my income wasn't allowed to be considered, and I would only be able to get $10,000.  It felt a bit ""bait and switchy"" but I continued.We did the online ""virtual closing"" where I shared my browser with her.  When the optional product of the life insurance came up, I initially declined it.  The agent put me on hold and the branch manager joined the call.  She stated, very plainly, that I was REQUIRED to purchase this insurance, and that I would not be able to get the loan without it.  I expressed that I already have private life insurance, and she stated that this wouldn;t be acceptable as ""private insurance takes too long to pay out"".  I was then given back to the agent and told to accept the insurance if I wanted to continue.  I was also signed up for the automatic payment program.  I said that I didn;t wish to do that and the agent made it very clear that I was REQUIRED to enroll in it if I wanted the loan.Later, during the signing portion, I noticed that not only was I NOT REQUIRED to purchase the insurance, but that was also not required to be enrolled in the autopayment.  When I brought this up, the agent said ""We can start over and unselect those items, but I'm sure it won't go through.""  I felt manipulated, lied to, and pressured by the agent to get these additional add-ons.  I would be willing to bet that the agent/branch manager get some sort of bonus or kickback if they sell x-number of additional products, and I don;t appreciate being lied to to make that happen.To top it off, the link that was emailed to me, after closing, that would have allowed me to view the forms I signed was inoperable.  The link asks for the last four of my social and a PIN.  I was never given the PIN, I assume the agent has it in an attempt to make it harder to call in and cancel the insurance as well as the automatic payment.  I called and inquired about getting a printed copy.  They made me drive 45 minutes to their office as they wouldn't email or mail them.  I have them now and will be canceling both items tomorrow.I will not be recommending OneMain Financial to ANY of my friends, and I've already told my wife that this is the only business we will ever do with OneMain.  Didn't Wells Fargo get in trouble for this EXACT type of behavior?",5

Allison,Honestly we were told the underwriter looked at our plan application and approved us. When we arrived we started late. Then we found out they waited for us to arrive to enter the collateral vin information to then change our terms after about 10-15 mins. Then the orders that showed up to sign were wrong not once but THREE times and we finally got out of there about 80 minutes later with a completely different loan amounts and terms. We felt we were told one story then given another and had we not been paying attention to the terms we were signing would have paid much more than what was originally agreed to. To say this experience was frustrating is an understatement.,5

I am very pleased with their service and their expertise and providing me the peace of mind I needed.,5

So than I just got a bad rating on my credit score due to them running a credit check and not approving me. That is so f  up. I’m thinking of  a lawsuit.

Jaime,"This is not an over exaggerated review or a review to bash One Main Financial but just an honest review of my overall experience.1.  I had a bad experience from start. If approved, they make you come in to sign electronic documents that could of simply been signed online. We are in the middle of pandemic and I even explained that I had a child but they still made me come in. Ok, no problem. 2. Even though it was an inconvenience, I still went in and signed all necessary electronic documents after approval. I was told funds would be in my account 1-2 business days. After the 2nd business day, I tried calling and no one answered the whole day. I finally got a call back on the 3rd day and they told me that they made a mistake on the routing number and that I had to come BACK TO THE OFFICE to pick up the check because they couldn't reissue the funds via ACH. At this point I was very disappointed and it became inconvenient for me but I needed the loan for medical reasons. When I picked up the loan, they did apologize but then I ran into another inconvenience. See #3 below for details.3. When they gave me the check it was a Friday around 12:45pm. I deposited the check into my bank only to find out that the money would not be available for 5 business days, which was Thursday of next week. This is not just a review on the person that helped me but the overall experience. Hope this review is helpful.",5
JOAN,I really appreciate your help to get this loan approved for me think you very much,5
Mark S,Everything was good till my loan was paid off and i never got my title,5
Bertha P,"I would not recommend this company at all.  At first, they were great I had no issues, but after 2 years of being a customer, no one seems to care or help me when I have an issue.  I purchased the insurance product with them and was approved.  I made payments while this was pending and now trying to get payments back is so hard.  I am on an unpaid medical leave so any extra funds would help.  The local branch doesn't seem to care at all in regards to this matter.  I would not recommend cause if anything goes wrong forget them helping their paying customers.",5
Terry A,Very helpful i would use one main again. I would past it on too my family friends and co.workers in this cov19 things been hard but one main finicial came through with flying stars thank u one main for ya help.,5

Gregory O,They wasted a week and a half of time taking all of my information only to tell me they couldn't help me. Called several times trying to figure out what I could do. Went out of my way to find a cosigner only for them to tell me after I did all the work it had to be a family member in state!!?! What kind of bull is that! Why waste all of my time and not say that before I spent 3 days looking for someone calling in everyday to be sure they qualifed! Complete waste of time and God awful communication. Multiple times I was told I'd get a call back and almost every time I had to call because I wouldn't get that call back. I've never ever written a bad review on any company but this is beyond ridiculous. I'm pissed because I'm in a tight spot in which I could have spent this time finding an alternate way to make the money but now I'm even more screwed over. Thanks one main I pray you don't this to anybody else!!!,5
Christopher P,Everyone I spoke with was clear and concise about how everything would go.  It was truly smooth sailing.,5
Crystal H,It was a pleasure working with OneMain Financial. My experience was stress free and I appreciate it!,5
Tony M,"My experience was good. I just think the interest rates are to high. The person that helped me was good. She answered all my questions. The only thing I dont like is if you have paid in say $1500.00, You should be able to borrow the amount you have paid in without your payment going up. But it doesn't work that way. But for the experience with loan officer it was good.",5

Runae Weber,Walked in and my paperwork sit down with a representative and was done in less than an hour long was approvedAnd everything went well,5
Brad A,I kept getting emails saying I was preapproved. I then finally applied and to  make a long story short - I had to submit a ton of info and just when I thought I was done - they asked for more.  This was supposed to be a secured loan with my car as collateral.   Well my credit company notified me that someone checked my credit - when I looked - each time they wrote to me saying I was preapprived - they checked my credit!!!! 5 times!!!!!!! Hard credits.  My score went down 10 points. Only to have them say in the end I wasn’t making enough so even though my car was collateral I was turned down.  What the heck - after 5 times checking my credit and 5 times saying I was preapproved.  Do not get involved with this crazy company.  Never experienced anything like it.,5

My loan agent proceeded to show it to whom I assumed was the manager, who also looked dumbfounded. After he flipped the letter several times reading he , he stated that I would receivr the eGift card within 14 Days. I waited 21 days before I contacted OneMain to inquire about the eGift card again. I was told that a ticket would be put in for my bonus. Here I am still calling inquiring about my eGift card that I have not received as of this day 8/5/21.

I just believe the process could be a little more straight forward especially since the interest rate is as high as it is,5
Sherecia T,Excellent. THANK you right on time.,5
Douglas C,"----> Responding to OneMain's comment to my original review below:1) Thanks for stating the obvious;2) Are you saying it's acceptable to practice usury given your ""standards"" related to income and credit?3) The original topic was related to ""deceptive"" and ""usurious"" practices, not credit worthiness nor income/ability to repay; 4) Your type of lending is illegal and defined as usury under California law (and many other states), but circumvented by way of a Federal Bank Charter law that allows for said ""usury"" or predatory and deceitful practices.5) It's just slimy and not sure what value you add by roping people into a lending crap-trap.  Thankfully, I have since paid off the loan and glad to NOT be a customer ever again.  I usually don't even review companies, but your general business model deserves special attention.You guys put a lot of lipstick on the pig.  Maybe be more explicit in your layer cake of b.s.  Try running an honest business that adds value.  It's good for everyone.  In your case it appears more of a rake-and-take scheme from people who can't create real value through innovation or hard work.I wish I would have read this comical description of ""DSI"" as you've re-branded what is commonly known as CONTINUOUS COMPOUNDING.  Description of ""DSI"" in OneMain's website:  ""But while many people initially assume the interest rate is calculated on a monthly or yearly basis, a DSI loan works differently."" **NOT to mention -- OneMain's website clearly targets folks with statistically lower credit scores; so per the ""standards"" comment below, maybe just call it your ""business model."" To Consumers reading this:  there are many better lending alternatives out there, even for folks with disadvantaged credit.  Most importantly, I hope this review dissuades a few folks from making a poor choice to work with OneMain.  Save your time and money, you're better than this economic parasite known as OneMain.To OneMain:  have fun with the CFPB Complaints and incoming legal actions.----->Original Review:They charge usury interest on personal loans.  I made $2500 in payments and my principal was reduced by only $330 over a 9 month period.  I'd say ""deceptive and usurious"" would be a compliment to them based on my experience to date.  I'll certainly never do business with them again and wish the worst for their organization.",5

Barbara P,Thaxs a lot you guys are the best,5
Teresita G,"Do not get a loan from this company !!! They are scam artists!!! They approved my loan and had me give them all my personal information and then never gave me the loan but called my car insurance and added their name as the loss payee!!! Plus for a $15,000 loan I would have paid double because of interest of a 5 year loan. My car won’t be worth the $5000 I would have gotten in 5 years. This is nothing more than a way to steal your vehicle  !! Thank God my friend works for my insurance company and was able to fix it but I did file a fraud report with BBB.  I usually throw out their ads but I wanted to do some debt consolidation I was so excited that I finally found a company to approve my loan but it was nothing more than a scam to get my personal information.. Good try Isaiah, Evan and Shane at the Wilkes Barre PA office.",5

I did as she suggested, was approved for the loan and my credit score rose!!!!! One Main Financial will help you sincerely move forward, all their employees are professional in all areas and explain exactly what you are signing for. I just love Sacha, she is absolutely amazing!",5
Gary L,"First off I find it rather interesting that you have a whole outline and guidelines for telling people how to write their reviews. I can immediately assume mine won't be posted. However I intend to write it anyhow. I got a mail offer from One Main Financial, so I went to the directed web address and immediately was told I must have Java Script on. So I went to settings triple checked everything and it was on. Yet I could not get past One Main Financial's first page because of the same error message? Seems to me like a run around scam!!",5

Lewis Rogers,"My 2nd loan with One Main in Roseburg, Oregon. First was for new heat pump, this time, years later, I got a loan to consolidate all my debt into one loan. I filled out an online form, just to see what the rate and payment would be. Got a prompt call from Mickie. We called back and forth, changing bits and pieces over a few weeks. She was very patient with me, as I get exhausted to the point of bedrest and ignored several of her calls. She was never pushy, very patient, just checking in. I finally went through my finances and gave her a number I would need, the amount the payment would have to be and percentage rate, to make it financially worth it to me. No sense in adding a debt with the same high interest, etc. She was able to get me that amount, halved the amount I was paying now and got me a 21.78% rate! Down from the 28-30% I was paying. She went over all the terms, what documentation I would have to upload, how to do that. We made an appt for me to come in on a day I already had to drive to Roseburg (1.5 hrs away). Took less than a half hour to electronically sign all the papers, she gave me time to read everything, explained everything. Suggested adding a credit insurance, in case something happens, I'm covered. Very friendly, personable, knowledgeable. Got exactly what I needed, to help me become more financially stable. Would definitely use One Main again for my loan needs.",5

My monthly expenses are now significantly reduced and I feel as though I have been given a new lease on life.  It was also good to be able to meet with a live person in my own town.

Haley Dawn Daly,"According to credit karma I was pre-approve for a personal loan from OneMain Financial. I called and spoke to a representative and went through the application process. They said that someone would contact me. Nobody did. I called them 2 days later and spoke to a lady. After I gave this lady my information, she asked me two question? How much is your rent and if I have a car? I told her how much my rent was and I do not have a car, she automatically told me that I did not qualify. for the personal loan. I now have a hard inquiry on my credit report and no loan. I would not recommend this company. The lady was very insensitive. I was also pre-approve to Lending Club, so I called and spoke to a representative who asked me questions and I was able to answer them. After I gave them my information they told me that I would get an email. I got me email and I was approved. I called on a Monday and my funds was in bank account four day later. I would definitely consider Lending Club. Now all my bills are paid off and now I just concentrate on paying my monthly loan, which is lower then what I was paying when I didn't have the loan. I would consider Lending Club over OneMain Financial anytime.",5

Jill F,"Literal garbage, go ahead an gouge out your eyes prior to thinking about doing business with this company. Minimal explaination of the products being sold, I went in needing 1000$, and was up sold to 10k and all these insurance that literally do nothing to help me. Not even the staff knows what they are doing as you must speak with at least 4 different people to find a consensus answer to any troubles you may be experiencing. Update: no one main, I do not want to talk to you, there is nothing you can do to change my mind or review. Hire better people, teach them every aspect of what they’re selling and don’t take advantage of your customers to make an extra buck. I’m going to make sure anyone I know personally or even anyone I come in contact with understands not to do business with you or your company.‼️‼️‼️IT SAYS ALOT ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS PRACTICES WHEN YOUR STORE MANAGER CANT EVEN EXPLAIN THE SERVICES AVAILABLE CORRECTLY ‼️‼️‼️",5
URSULA,"Worst customer service! Application online said I was approved, I called to sign documents, my agent was busy so I left a message. Wait til the next day, application on-line still shows approved, call again, agent says my rep was busy and would call me back, I asked if someone else could assist and he informs me my application was disapproved and hangs up.. Unacceptable customer service! Beware before you work w/ this company",5

After my deployment I continued on Active Duty on an additional tour.  When I went back to renew my loan I was told that I couldn't because I was still on Active Duty.  Even though I actually made more money on Active Duty, had paid off over half the current loan in half the time, and was currently two months ahead in payments.   And to try again after I came off orders.  This doesn't show me that One Main supports the military family.",1

Tina J,"So, I keep getting these mailers sent to me telling me to apply for a loan who has an invitation code on it every time, and every time I apply I get denied. Why even bother sending me a mailer inviting me to apply for a loan if I'm just going to be turned down every single time? That's a waste of paper on your end and it's aggravating on my end.  By now you should have figured out that if I don't qualify for a loan the first three to four times you send the invitation, then I'm probably not going to qualify this time either. So please stop sending me this crap if you're not going to approve me. It's a waste of my time.",5

Sharon K,"IF ANYONE USES OR PLANS TO USE OneMain FINANCIAL DO NOT WORK WITH THEIR NATIONAL TEAM. KEEP IT IN A LOCAL OFFICE! THE TITLE DEPARTMENT THROUGH THE NATIONAL OFFICE IS IGNORANT AND BEYOND INCOMPITENT. I HAVE BEEN A LOYAL CUSTOMER FOR OVER 5 YEARS AND NEVER HAD A COMPLAINT UNTIL TODAY, I HAVE BEEN WAITING SINCE 9 AM EST TO GET 1 DOCUMENT CORRECTED IT IS NOW 7:25 PM EST BECAUSE THEY DONT KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A BLACK VEHICLE AND A WHITE ONE.. oh did I mention this is after receiving Vin number and pictures of the vehicle and had the information previously on file? How did you even get it wrong? Why can you not speak to the title department? Why can a manager not do anything other than send an email escalation? ONEMAIN ppl are depending on you!!  #worstexperienceever",5
Carrie C,"I have done business with OMF Mayfield OH for several years now (6+) and the service has been Great......until today 7/19/21.  I normally don't take the time to write reviews but today it is warranted.  On 7/15 I paid off my loans and today I realized a payment had been pulled from my account.  Contacted the office and spoke with Isha Jacobson and explained my concern.  I had turned off the auto pay and was wondering how another payment came thru.  Ms. Jacobson explained why the payment was pulled and when asked how if auto pay was turned off I was directed to contact customer service because she was unable to assist me!  I am not an unreasonable person however, her raising her voice at me when I am trying to get an understanding is unacceptable, unprofessional and Rude!!  Worst part is when I asked for her name she nicely threw out there that she was the Branch Manager!  Shame on you for being a branch manager and not being capable explaining the situation.  To further add to the problem I contacted customer service and when I explained the situation and told them I was direct to contact them, they asked who i had spoken with and what the branch was and the rep mad the statement...she was unable to handle this for you? After being on the phone for 47 minutes, understood why the payment was pulled but still no explanation of how if I had stopped auto pay.  Once I asked that question...AGAIN...the phone disconnected.  Funny how after being on a call that long that the representative, Abigail (didn't get her last name) didn't have the common decency to call me back!  Strike 2!!  Decided to go into the office and speak with Stacy (do not know her last name), who has handled my accounts for years, for an explanation.  Thank You to Stacy for taking the time to explain everything to me without raising her voice or being rude! It was evident while I was at the office that Isha Jacobson the Branch Manager doesn't like to work or maybe she thinks dealing directly with customers is beneath her.  I say this because as Stacy was working with me another customer entered the branch to make a payment.  How rude of Isha to bring the payment to Stacy for processing as she was explaining the situation.  Was she not capable of doing it...knowing why I was there to begin with.  Clearly Isha needs some additional Customer Service training!  I'm not saying the customer is always right but when someone calls in needing an explanation, taking the time to look into their concerns and apologizing about the miscommunication/mix up and not raising your voice at them goes along way to keeping your customer happy and getting great reviews.  Isha Jacobson put such a bad taste in my mouth to where I will never do business again with OMF as long as she a Branch Manager!  Disgusting!!!One last thing....please do not reply with the canned message!  If OMF appreciates valued customers, they will reach out...not me reaching out to OMF after writing such a review!",5
Melvin ,"If I could 0 star them I would! 2nd time I have received pre-approval with them, apply just to be told my car is not of value for the loan. Number one not disclosing al possible scenarios of the loan is lieing and misleading. Telling me I am pre approved, me applying and taking a hit on my credit is complete bull crap! I will never work with them again or give them a chance again. Screw you ONE MAIN",5
Robert J. Patterson,"The staff was very friendly, knowledgeable and efficiant. They had my loan approved right away",2
Cheryl M,I received excellence customer service and great assistance with my recent loan.,5
Christina C,"They took a week to close a refinance loan.Then they closed on the due date of the original loan, and then deducted that old loan payment on the same day they deposited the new loan. Ridiculous way of doing business,the loan rep. never said anything about them still deducting for the old loan.This was the fourth loan I have had with them, and will be the last.",5
Emily Christensen,OneMain in Cleveland TN is one of the if not the most friendly professional knowledgeable staffs you will ever encounter in the business of money lending.

V. H,"Very TERRIBLE experience ! On July 15 ,2021 I had to call and arrange my monthly loan payment,which I have been consistently doing since two years now .NEVER SKIP ONE MONTH .I spoke with someone name Puneet who was not willing to help out ,and I ended up requesting to be transferred to a manager who could help me.  RATONDA picked up the phone,and as  soon as I tried to explain my situation which was of if she could help me make partial payment out of $194 due to avoid a late fees of $19.99,this lady was being NASTY,RUDE ,UNPROFESSIONAL caught me OFF before I even finish my sentence and said"" I know what it is and  there is nothing I can help me with ,it is what it is"". So speechless I was ,I ask her what was her position and if she was the manager there . She responded VERY rudely and said ""YES"" she was the BRANCH manager. WAUU!! is that how you all treat your CLIENTS ?? I am skeptical! I will NEVER NEVER recommend this office to anyone. Please if you need a loan ,go somewhere else where they TREAT WELL clients. Because these people at OMF Gaithersburg MD does not know how to ,and just need your money forgetting that we CLIENTS are the reason why their office still open. NOTE ,this isn't the first time they being rude to me. Whenever I call to make my monthly payment ,at least once in the three times someone there is nasty and does not know how to talk to people. #IMPROVEYOURSKILLS",5

Brian W,"July 2021: I was hesitant at first after reading mixed reviews but decided to apply for a loan and was offered a pre-approval amount. I spoke to two different agents: one who finished the verification application and the other who checked on my paystubs/uploaded documents. I was told that a closing agent would contact me to proceed ACH deposit and to sign of the contract - while repeatedly congratulating me on my approval. The following day, an agent from a local branch called and told me that my loan is not approved and that it was miscommunicated. Apparently the first agents who I spoke to doesn't check on documents/pay stubs and that the statement that was confirmed were scripted (this is how onemain train their agents - scripted sentences - ie: ""Congratulations! You're Approved!"" but in reality ""We cannot offer you a loan at this time""). I have the impression that everyone is approved until it reaches the branch manager who then decides if he/she wants to move forward with the loan - plenty of banking politics come to play. Furthermore, I was lied to and got my hopes up. My credit has been hit with a hard pull with nothing in hand. This company is a scam. Do not proceed with OneMain. They are a bunch of liars! Try your local credit union(s), they're more transparent in the procedure with better ratings.",5

When I received my pay stub i up loaded it. Have not heard back from that guy. Then tried to resubmit my application. I get a call from a different location. She starts working on the loan.  Then finds out I’m closer to another location, so she’s suppose to redirect me. Then hangs up and I don’t hear from anyone. Thats very unorganized. And as a union ironworker, unorganized is unprofessional. So, hopefully better luck to you people trying this.",5

I asked for their corporate number they acted like they didn't know it. Or put you on hold for long periods of time ( playing games ) Very unprofessional. I know for a fact it had to be because I didn't take their insurance. No one was on the same page as for communication. I'm glad I didn't take their loan. I wasn't as desperate as they thought. This place doesn't even  deserve one star!",5

Hector L,"The online application was easy to use.  The problems I had was the communication and not give all of the information.  Your company did ask me to send information, but is was done several times.  It would be better if you sent all the requested items needed at one time.  This was very frustrating and took several days when it did not have to take that long.  I also had to make several called to make sure that your company had all the information needed for my request.The final step for loan approval was the worst.  I needed to send in my title and was told to print the FedEx label.  I did not know the lable was sent to me by a different E-mail account.  That information was not given to my when I talked to many of your customer service agents.  I did not get this information until I requested to talk to a supervisor which never happened.  I just keep getting told that the supervisor would call me back later and it NEVER happened.  I always had to make the calls to finally get to the end with the loan getting done.  That is why I gave you this rating.  If you would like to talk about this I would be happy to.",5

Clay,I used OneMain Fin. out of Carmel IN. It was an unexpected vet charge that we needed to cover for an extensive surgery for our puppy. Even in a stressful time and in what seemed like a very time sensitive exchange not once did I feel rushed and honestly I felt like both reps I worked with slowed things down and pointed out we should look at the big picture - see this as a chance to make some big positive impact on my credit and debt and not just handle one emergency and wait for another to come. I was taken care of advised and given some amazing advise that is benefiting more than just the one incident with the puppy - we have now been able to consolidate and knock off over $800 in monthly payments. All because they cared and treated me and my family like people who didn't have all the answers and they knew they could help.,2
Customer,My credit is not the best... OneMain worked with me to give me the best options.  I was truly pleased with the help and the quickness of the entire process.

The representative that handled my application was very professional and knowledgeable of her job and the company’s policy.  In just a few days I was approved for the loan I’ve requested, and the money was deposited into my bank account in timely manner.   I will surly recommend this company to friends and family. Thanks to OneMain Financial!",5
Marivic,"At a time when I needed a loan. Did not want one, but it was in my best interest to have one. One Main Financial came thru for me with no hassles at all. The interest rate could of been a point or two lower. ( In keeping closer to the Banks and Credit Union). But it was under 15 percent. And I did have a bankruptcy a few years ago, even though I was back over 700 on my credit score. In 2 years. That's my story and I feel very lucky to have done business with One Main.",5
Wendy S,My loan has been processed over a week.  I did a bill consolidation and none of the credit cards have been paid causing me to have late charges.  A week is ample time to have this done already.  Especially with electronic pay now.  The lady that processed my loan was very low on knowledge. I will be checking after the. Weekend to see if the bills were paid.   Very unsatisfied with the professionalism of the employee I dealt with.  I will never use one main again.  Bad business,5
Enchantra Grice,"I’m a existing customer that received an email that I “pre-qualified” for additional money. Pre-qualified emails are a dog and pony show as you resubmit everything all over again. I processed online yesterday, received a call from local branch provided all initial documentation. No call back, today while at work I receive call and send additional documentation being pics of all 4 sides of my vehicle, front and back also, VIN and odometer. The agreement was to call after both of our lunches to close loan as I’m working and cannot visit branch. She called at agreed upon time to request yet again more info being mortgage amount as it was not showing on my credit report. I asked how was it not showing as they saw it initially when I 1st became their customer but not now? Of course being at work I have no documentation so I send her a screen shot of my escrow payments that clearly shows mortgage and estimated taxes, that wasn’t enough. I sent her screenshot of Venmo as I can pay that way also but it does not show the entire banking info (just last 4 of account number) she stated it needs to shows exact amount I told her who is paying exact amounts these days, sometimes I pay less prompting the next month to be more with late fees, interest etc. Within banking all I can capture written check but that takes away my identifying account info. This pre-qualified process is worse as a on-time never late customer than it was when I walk in a stranger. It’s bizarre. I called to tell her that if she couldn’t accept all the documentation I had provided I didn’t need the hassle or the loan. She said to go home and look for the additional info, I told her I wasn’t interested in do that, she stated she’d calm me on Monday, I told her I rather her not. Going round and round for 5 days is kinda ridiculous. I’ve never taken the time to write such a review but this experience moved me too. I have had pleasant experiences with Main Financial this far, I got my loan, they auto deduct my payments but sending me a “pre-qualified” scheme was not the best thing to do. My advise let a happy customer be a happy customer when you solicit me with nothing but inconvenience you turn me sour. Like how many ways can one verify house payments especially when they never needed to be verified initially. *face palm*",5
customer,"I’ve used One Main Financial before (MI) to consolidate debts, so when I moved to FL & saw a branch near me, I returned to tie up my small debts in MI. Simple, straightforward, easy process. Friendly helpful staff - thanks Todd at Cape Coral branch! I’d highly recommend them!",5
Virginia M,"Fast, friendly & efficient service! I needed to consolidate my debts...most of which were from credit cards...as I needed to help my credit score and have 1(one) bill payment instead of 10(ten) because I will be looking to procure our first home in about 6 - 7 months. Banks would much rather see 1(one) debt instead of the 10(ten) I would have had. AND OneMain Financial was able to help my situation! Plus: The interest rate I have to pay for my debt consolidation loan from OneMain Financial is so low it's as if I'm getting the loan from a friend! Infact, it is 19% less than the next financial institution willing to loan me the same amount! INCREDIBLE! And the customer service I received from Justin & the rest of the OneMain Financial team in SLO is 2nd to none! I would most definitely recommend that your future loan experience be done with OneMain Financial services!!! Daniel K, Paso Robles",5

Peggy B,"I have been rebuilding my credit for the past 2 years. I check my reports and scores daily and weekly with several different platforms some that I have to pay for. Credit karma is Vantagescore3.0 and irrelevant! Your fico score is what lenders look at and there are several different fico scores for everyone. I tried to finance a motorcycle with a fico 8 score of 697 and $3000 down payment on a $15,000 bike and was denied by a traditional lender even though the motorcycle would have had a lien from the bank on it. The reason I was turned down: A charge off on an account over 3 years ago. No other red flags.  A few days later I was going over my reports and scores from Experian. I decided to see what I would pre-qualify for on a personal loan. In Minutes OneMain Financial Pre-qualified me for a $6000 personal loan. I called the local office and spoke to Maxine. She was excellent and professional. In less than 15 minutes on the phone I was approved for a $12000.00 personal loan at a very competitive rate. 9% less than another lender that also pre-qualified me. I made an appointment for a few days later to go in and sign for the loan. It was super easy and I was in and out in 30 minutes. The next morning when I checked my bank account the $12000.00 loan had been wired in. I went and purchased my motorcycle yesterday. Thank You OneMain Financial and Thank You Maxine for making the process easy and enjoyable! You guys Rock...",5

Phyllis D,I would honestly give this place no stars if it were at all possible now I applied for a 2500 dollar personal loan which they returned my offer with an 8000 dollar offer which for upwards of 2 weeks was the agreement due to me needing to fix issues on my side which I did so after I fixed my side of things they then proceeded to try and deposit the 8000 dollars into my account which for some reason they could not direct deposit it 'Which they made me fix is why it took 2 weeks' but even after I fixed what they asked they still could not deposit the funds which they now tell me I need to go to my nearest branch to get a check so I agree and wait few more days for an appointment now because for 2 weeks I was told again and again I was getting 8 thousand dollars I spent other money paying other things then what it was originally for due to me thinking I had 8k coming so I go to my appointment for them to wait till the very last minute to tell me I was now only receiving 3800 because my most recent check was short my normal hours due to me having to take a day off to handle so called loan so now because of that they tried telling me I no longer make enough for the 8k this place is a joke I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. Why approve me for something and drag it on to drop it a large amount at very last minute I will be returning the loan and doing my best to make sure no one gets screwed by this company again,5

Stacey Gronenthal,"My credit score is in the 600's so I thought a loan approval would be next to impossible for me. I applied for a loan at another financial company but they turned me down. I pay my bills on time but I have too many of them, so a Bill consolidation loan would literally help me get rid of bills that were all over the place. I took a chance and filled out a 2 to 3-minute loan application with OneMain Financial online on Friday and Monday Morning very early I received a call from OneMain Financial saying ""Mr. Cooper, your loan was approved. Where do you want your money deposited""? Just like that! The money was deposited into my bank account almost instantly. $7500! OneMain Financial gave me a loan at a good rate and low repay payment that is very comfortable for my wallet. Thanks, OneMain Financial! Thanks for the opportunity to allow me to get my finances on track. 5 STARS*****",1

Ashley R,"The process was very quick and informative. Our rep was very helpful and explained the whole process and paperwork to us. My only complaint was he did not seem to give us enough time to read the documents thoroughly but rather tell what each document was. Personally, when borrowing a large sum and using my vehicle as collateral, want to read each document to ensure I fully understand terms and procedures. I am very happy with our experience and will refer One Main Financial to others",5
Tyronda T,"The online process was easy, OMF was referred through my Credit Karma Account & I was approved for more that what I asked for. The OMF Associate was so friendly & very helpful.

John O,"I have two loans with one main (Should be one which is the main issue) after not servicing my loan to my satisfaction despite telling me multiple times over a 3 week process in which I constantly had to chase them for updates. I was lied to about the type of loan I was signing for (I plan on reporting this). Now I’m stuck paying an outrageous amount monthly on two loans, I will always guide people away from taking a loan with this institution, ESPECIALLY YOUNG PEOPLE. I luckily can pay the amount of both loans but as someone >25 it is just disgusting they would mislead any young adult for financial gain.",5

I was interested in the loan for debt consolidation, thinking this would be a good start to get me back on track. Its easier to make 1 monthly payment than multiple. With that being said I replied to one of their offers only to be declined cause of my high credit cards. Ummm..hello I KNOW THAT...this is why I replied to the offer. It's just funny how they promote to help people with not so great credit, and debt consolidation etc.... yet they deny me? Which is fine, just feel they need to change their marketing techniques!",5

I have been a long-time good customer but yet when they finally got everything done, she said they were super busy and this was tough one because of the paperwork in signing up the car dealership as a merchant so she did not get the $3,000 cash that I needed. She asked if I wanted to stop the check from going out but my vehicle was already on a transport truck so that was not an option.  I told her that I was vey unhappy and dissatisfied about this but there was no resolution offered on her part.  Meghan is very nice but this was terrible!",5

Loretta Burton,I have to reapply for the loan as the associate that I talked to try to push a bigger loan utilizing my vehicle as collateral even that after several times I told him that was not what I need it. He came across forceful and at times a little rude. Also when i finally reapply and got the loan he pushed me to sign for additional stuff telling me that it was already added in the payment.

Front,"My husband and I bought some property and wanted to build a house. I've been working to improve my credit for some time now but discovered I was 16 points shy from qualifying for a construction loan. With my debts being paid off, my credit hasn't done much the last 2 months so instead of getting another credit card I decided to get a small loan with OneMain. This loan will enable me to begin work on our property and build my credit. The process was fast and I was given payment options. Yes, the interest rate is terribly high, but we even discussed ways to save money on that too. Once I pay off this loan, I'll be back for another to get my well and septic. Piece by piece OneMain and I will build my forever home.",5

Edward W,"OneMain Financial is the absolute worst company that I have ever dealt with.  I was given approval for a loan that would free up 400 per month in exchange for a 70(ish) payment.  However, in their ""wisdom"", they decided to decline me based on circumstances that this load would have fixed.  This way of doing business should be a warning sign to all employees, current victims with loans, and prospective clients to leave this company ASAP because the company is full of scumbags and bordering on scamming thousands if not millions out of their customers.",5

After taking a deep breath I filled out the easy application and was almost immediately contacted by a representative who was extremely friendly and helpful. This has been the best experience and my credit score has improved so quickly I was just approved for my second loan with the company!

Nathaniel D,"Update: One Main reached out to me and resolved all my issues. I still give them only four stars because of what happened, but their customer service after these events changed my review and opinion of them dramatically. I would recommend them, but if you have problems, I suggest you pursue with their Corporate Offices, who seem much more professional and customer service- oriented than their local office was, at least in my city. My original review was:After many years of no missed payments and multiple loans, I had re-paid my borrowed amounts, at exorbitant interest rates, yet still owed One Main thousands of dollars, until I finally refinanced with a credit union at a fraction of One Main’s interest rates. More than half of every payment went to interest, not the principal amount borrowed. During the payoff process, One Main repeatedly gave both me and my new finance company the wrong pay-off amount. When One Main received the check in the exact amount they had repeatedly quoted me and my new financiers, the exact amount they had given me again just the day before, they called me and wanted even more money from me before giving me a letter showing my zero balance. They lied about our many phone calls, lied about even speaking to the new company about the amount due, and insisted the new company had not called them at all for the proper amount. Then the supervisor who spoke to me had the gall to offer me a payment plan to pay off the “remaining balance.” I refused and told them I had already overpaid them for years and sent them the exact amount they quoted us on our repeated phone calls. They denied having any record of any previous calls and denied quoting me the balance due yet again just the day before. I told them they were not squeezing any more money from me. I am elderly and disabled and live on Social Security as my only income, yet I had paid them on time every month for many years. This company takes advantage of vulnerable people in need like me, and keeps us attached with the highest interest rates I’ve ever seen. I would have been paying another three years had I not gotten out of their clutches by rebuilding my credit and qualifying elsewhere. They are no better than the rip-off payday loan corner shops that know you need them more than they need you. Shame on you, One Main Financial. I am looking into how to report your unethical and abusive business practices and your taking illegal and abusive advantage of honest, reliable, vulnerable people in need like me.",5
Felicia D,"I have had several loans with OneMain for several years now. Every representative I have worked with has been very thorough, professional, friendly, and accommodating, even during Covid. This is always my go-to place for personal loans. With my credit score being low, I pay out of the nose with high percentage rates but that is everywhere and I can’t criticize anyplace for that. It’s completely my fault. I am thankful that OneMain gives me the exceptional customer service loan experience that they do. I will always highly recommend them.",5
Kimberly M,"They are very professional and I got my loan within an hour of signing all documents.  At first I took the lower loan, then decided to take out the full loan a couple of days later and the branch manager was on it swiftly and I received the rest of the money within 2 hours of contacting him. I would highly recommend anyone to get this loan.",5
Mathew Q,"One Main is alright with me. And this is not a fake post. I've had great experiences with them so far. I was skeptical about borrowing.   Didn't know what to expect( high payments, unreasonable options). One main loan reps were helpful, informative and patient during the process which only took a few hours to finalize. I was happy with my payments and options. I only agreed to what I needed. Don't hesitate, they are th real deal if your in a jam, need to make a purchase or want extra cash. Keep in mind- have what you need to make it happen. No hassle, stress free! Tell them Starr Nelson sent ya! 😊",5

Sandra,"Blue Springs Missouri Office. On June 17th, of this year I was approved for a loan of up to $9,200.00, with an interest rate of 17.9 percent, but at the time I only needed $7,000.00. So that is what I borrowed on that day. I was told that if I needed to borrow any more of the amount that I was approved for that it would be at the same interest rate of 17.9 percent. That weekend a couple of things happened to where I would need to borrow the remaining amount I was approved for. On Monday June 21st, 3 days later I called the Blue Springs Missouri office that I initially completed my paperwork at and I told them my situation. They said I could borrow the remaining amount at the same interest rate of 17.9 percent...no problem. However, when completing the paperwork on the additional loan amount I noticed the interest was 24.9 percent and not what I was told it would be. When I questioned the loan associate about the higher interest rate than what I was quoted he just kept saying it's out of my control, it's out of my control. Desperate for the money I followed through with the paperwork but was distraught to say the least. Not feeling any better about it the next day I called the Blue Springs Missouri office and talked to the branch manager. I was told the same thing by him and that was it was out of his hands, and that it was all up to their algorithms. The branch manager said he would lodge my complaint but that in the end nothing would probably come of it. My situation is this; I'm retired and on fixed income. I chose One Main Financial because of their low interest rates, but this just makes me feel like I'm being taken advantage of and there is nothing I can do to fix it.So much for their 7-day okay satisfaction promise.The office I conducted my business is located at 2007 NW Hwy 7, Blue Springs, Mo 64014, telephone number 1-816-228-1798.  Signed, thoroughly disappointed!",5

Donna B,"In order to establish some credit history, I decided to pursue a personal loan.  I have been unable to do anything requiring credit for about a decade due to some outstanding student loan debt which I have recently settled.  From the start, I was impressed with One Main Financial.  From the website to the office, it felt right.  Julie was exceptional.  She went out of her way to assist me in gathering what was necessary.  When we encountered a problem, she would come up with a solution.  If a less willing and agreeable person would have caught my call, I would have given up.  We scheduled an appointment for the next day and I left the office having secured a personal loan.  There was no subterfuge, no gimmicks, no fine print.  Furthermore, there was nothing tedious about the process.  I left with a clear understanding of my obligation and none of it felt threatening or burdensome.  I took on the student loan debt as an 18-year-old.  At that age, you don’t know what you don’t yet know.  I can’t recall any person ever offering constructive advice or instruction.  When they did happen, interactions were so unpleasant, that I would avoid them at all costs.  This has been my expectation.  To have been treated fairly, honestly and responsibly has been a blessing.  In Julie, I feel I have an advisor.  I can’t say the system as a whole is necessarily better than it was 20 years ago, but One Main Financial is a better business.  They have created a way for me.",5

Taylor even got the young man up front to help assist me while she waited on the internet to download the pictures. Taylor finished me up & explained all the payment options that  I could choose from and also told me about paying extra whenever I like to & put it towards my principal Everything went well and everyone thanked me for coming In.

James C,"This is one of the worst car buying experiences that I've had. When I reached out to One Main, I did not know that my account had moved to the Centralized Financial Center. I spoke with my local agent to find out. She advised me that I was an awesome customer but they no longer serviced my loan. She then provided me with the contact information of who I should reach out to. This is where the nightmare began.I reached out and got connected with an individual that was unfamiliar with the trade-in process so I hung up and dialed again. I was connected with another individual. Once I explained what I wanted to do (trade-in & new loan), he then gathered my information. He then provided that I was approved. As I got further with the approval, some how he then thought that I wanted to keep my current car & LOAN as well as get another car and loan. I had to go though that information over again that I wanted to trade in my car and  have only  payment. The process became even more horrible. As I continued to speak with guy that processed my loan, he was unaware the check was to be sent over to the dealership where I purchased the car. I had to explain that to him. The I had to explain that the dealership needed the title to the current vehicle because I was trading it in. He then stop answering my calls so I had to drive to the local branch to get assistance from the branch manager. after days, I was able to get the title for the car so I would be able to complete my transaction and get my new car. I was transferred to so many different areas where none of them were able to assist me. Only one person that was located in Title Track was able to assist and he stayed on the line with me as I was trying to resolve the issue. This may be a premature statement, but the center needs additional training. They should not have agents continuing to tell a customer , ""I do not know the answer for this"". I heard that so many times, it made me nervous about this loan. This WORSE decision was for my loan to be transferred to the center in Fort Mill, SC. If I would have known this, I WOULD NOT HAVE RENEWED my loan. This was by far the WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. In the future, if I can't get assistance with a local branch, this would be my last relationship with One Main Financial.",4

They keep asking me to upload the same information every day. When I call them, the person answering just says,""I don't know"" and doesn't transfer me to a supervisor. Never have I dealt with such unprofessional of a company who treats their customers with rudeness. Still waiting for them to finalize my refinanced loan. Does anybody know how to speak with a supervisor?",5

These days, everyone looks at your credit score and I could easily increase it with a small personal loan, yet no one was willing to help me... because of my score! Jennifer listened to my goals, understood what I was trying to accomplish, and she took into account all the positives of my finance history. Needless to say, I was approved! I used my loan to take care of a few deprecating marks towards my credit and my score went up 57 points in the first 2 weeks. Thank you so much OneMain, and Jennifer, for a great jumpstart towards my credit goals!",5

Like a lot of us out there, I use to have excellent credit and through no fault of my own I lost my employment, couldn’t keep up with credit card payments and eventually everything went downhill from there I was thankful to even get approved. Only one downside, I was “pre-approved” for $6000 according to credit karma and that’s what I thought I was applying for. I got half of that and didn’t realize until the day it was time to sign the papers. So just verify from the get go the loan amount your asking for is what your going to get.",5

However, I called back and discussed my issue with the manager, Marissa. Marissa was able to assist and continue and complete the process smoothly and rapidly. Kudos to Marissa for a job well done.",5
Jerry T,"The Branch Manager is an absolute JOKE! She has no way with people and is highly unprofessional. When speaking with her, I clearly herd her place the phone down either on speaker or on mute. She didn't even listen to anything I was saying. The worst part is that there were others in the background laughing for whatever reason. She is great at avoiding your questions. She DID NOT answer any questions I had regarding my Loan application, instead she kept repeating round about answers that were in no way an answer to any of the questions I was asking. When I pointed that out, she became upset and threatened to hang up without even assisting me completely. A manager is supposed to de-escalate situations and provide solutions and answers. This lady has no clue and no professional demeanor. Her employees ended up assisting me in the end because she damaged her reputation so bad, those poor ladies had to step in and help out. Although I could hear her in the background telling them what to say, the employees were actually trying to help. Shame on OMF for hiring and keeping a BRANCH MANAGER that is so unprofessional and unable to conduct business. This is a bank! I expect that the BRANCH MANAGER act like a profesional and conduct herself with higher standards. I hope that no one reading this has to interact with this woman, and if you do, write everything down and don't believe what she says. She will not give you her superiors number, she gives the number to another branch, where they are equally as rude. For a financial institution, I am astonished at the lack of professionalism.",5
