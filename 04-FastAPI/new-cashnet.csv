Reset password,I normally woulda been giving a great review since never had any issues with them .. however recently I tried renewing & now denied in which the denial states something to the effect of not enough creditials which is incorrect Due to I have always paid back early & in full & a day before I decided to take the loan I had already been approved .. had I known it was gonna change I would have just renewed that day,5,1
Good customer service,Great vustomer,5,1
It was a toss up between 4 & 5 only bc‚Ä¶,"Cashnet was great at trying to help me, they talk to me like they cared!!",5,1

Bunch of crooks!! All i see is bad reports idk what i was thinking!!I highly don‚Äôt recommend these people to anyone!!",5,1

Customer service,Always there for me with outstanding service!,5,1
Great customer service!,Called cashnet USA today as they requested about the 300% interest rates. They won't work with you except to extend payments or split them getting you farther and farther into debt as they continue to collect that high interest. It's like $14 a day!!!!  Being on social Security and elderly doesn't mean anything to them. Companies like this force you into bankruptcy.  I have a $2500 loan with another on line company and payments are not even half that.  All I can say is I would highly recommend against borrowing from this company.,5,1
Went very smoothly,Approval was very fast and courteous and really got me out of a jam,5,1
She was right on point my problem was‚Ä¶,"Website is super user friendly. This is fast and easy money, but horribly expensive. The interest makes it impossible to pay down if you can‚Äôt pay the whole balance right away.",5,1
Easy and quick,Excellent attention to my needs. Made me feel important to the company,5,1
The absolute best customer service !!!,Very good company.  Willing to work with you if problems arise.  Recommend highly.,5,1
This is new to me and I will know more‚Ä¶,I never get my money same day. When it says it's going to deposit next day be late the next day and still have missed everything I need to pay. So usually takes 2 days to get it but my payments be on time. No problem.,5,1
The process was smooth and fast‚Ä¶,Highly recommend CashNetUSA. Super quick and easy process. Funds same day. Great company,5,1
Good job,Got the money the same day. Helpful.,5,1
Excellent service as always,It was great satisfying efficient well explained detailed the young lady that helped me deserves a raise,5,1
It was easy and super simple,The representative was very helpful and knowledgable! She understood my concern and explained it to ny understanding!,5,1
But experience was good with no attitude,This company is a company that takes advantage of individuals. It charges the highest rate possible on daily interest. You can only hope they get ran out of business by reasonable companies that offer fair and affordable rates. BestEgg offers actual companies with normal loans. This place is operated like a check writing service. Do not use them. I got a $1500 loan and my first 3 payments will add up to $1300 then I will be expected to continue payments until April of 2024.,5,1
Great Customer Service,Always there when I need them! An absolute life saver. Keep up the fantastic work.,5,1

Always good,I thank you for the help. But taking payment out of each paycheck that leaves nothing to pay bills with or buy food is becoming a burden!!,5,1
Loan,I love cashnet my line of credit has came in handy I don't know how many times and if something comes up with a payment they are very easy to work with I recommend them to everyone I know when they talk about getting a loan thank you cashnet.,5,1
Excellent service,"The young lady who helped me, after I had issues online finishing up the application, was the best customer service person I've ever dealt with. I applaud her for helping me. She made me feel important. Thank you!!!",5,1
Great,I am a satisfied customer and I respect the company that I borrow and make loans through .Cashnetusa will always be my first choice in all my financial matters.I reccomend Cashnetusa  and trust them emphatically. Thank you Cashnetusa.,5,1
I would highly recommend this site,I don‚Äôt like the fact that it takes days for my payment to post which appears as if I‚Äôll never paid it off unless the scheduled payment plus additional monies is paid too!! It deters you from having an available balance to draw from and it appears the payment isn‚Äôt getting paid down.,5,1
Resolved my issue,Very friendly and knowledgeable,5,1
Thanks for your help,Predatory loan terms that should be criminal and fined into bankruptcy.,5,1
Excellent job,"CashNetUSA have been a blessing to me, because I needed money right now. They help me out and I will tell anybody to try they. God bless.",5,1

It was very quick and easy,Payments are way too high that I can not keep up. They keep raising my credit limit when I did not ask them to!,4,1
I've never had a problem with CashNet,THIS IS A TOTAL RIP OFF TO ME! IN JULY I GOT A LOAN OF $900. THEY DO A DIRECT WITHDRAWAL FROM MY ACCOUNT BI-WEEKLY WHEN I AM PAID. THEY HAVE TAKE OUT OF ATLEAST 6 OF MY CHECK. EANGING FROM $100-$160. WHY SHOULD I STILL HAVE A BALANCE OF $825? WHY MUST INTEREST CHARGES KEEP ADDING UP IF I AM ON A PAYMENT PLAN WITH THEM BI-WEEKLY?? AN ABSOLUTE RIP OFF!! NEVER AGAIN WILL I EVER DEAL WITH THEM OR RECOMMEND ANYONE TO THEM!!,5,1
Easy!,My experience with Cashnet has been very good.,5,1
Received response quickly,"Beware! CashNet are always there when you need it. However, be careful! The loan docs don't say how much you will be paying each payment until you get approved and the money is already on the way. I personally used them a few years ago and again just a few months ago with no change in how they do business. Payments are super high (car payment) for the first few months and then get lower to where you can afford it. It is not a steady payment plan where you can budget. I have it listed under ""last resort"" when I need a loan because of this. Beware!",5,1
Easy to use and making payments are easy,"I appreciate your company lending me money. I am having a hard time paying off the balance before another payment is due. Is there anything your company can do to lessen this burden on me. I understand if you can‚Äôt, it‚Äôs just hard to make a $800 payment on a $3000( approximately) three or 4 months and still owe the majority of the principal. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.",4,1
I had a good experience very nice and‚Ä¶,"CashNetUsa has taught me a very important lesson--make sure you read all the fine print before you make a deal. About a month ago I borrowed $1500 and was hit with an automatic withdrawal payment of over $350 for my first payment. Now I have a $430+ payment due and owe a total of over $1700.. The key to doing business with this company is to be able off your entire bill before the first payment is due, otherwise you will hand out money until you run out of it completely.",4,1
Was very helpful and good  quick and‚Ä¶,They were quick and efficient.,5,1
Always there to help!!!,"So easy to use and helpful when help can seem hard to find. Thank you, CashNet!",5,1

Cashnet was great at trying to help me,Well it‚Äôs great to be able to get a loan base on your credit but not good to keep raising the price for payment everytime you get paid! I am getting further in hole with this loan than I ever did! I can‚Äôt wait to pay it off because now I know I won‚Äôt do this again,5,1

I just needed the money to get by until payday but It seems I will get paid before it is even deposited. Just a little confused because in my email and at the top it said it will be deposited today and haven't received the deposit or any emails regarding the loan except to leave a review and that funds would be available today.

Three months worth of FULL (every single page) bank statements, access and login information to your personal checking account, plus a slew of other things! That‚Äôs an invasion of privacy it‚Äôs none of their business what I spend my money on. Absolutely under no circumstances should you waste your time dealing with this company. And you can take that to the bank, because it‚Äôs the ONLY thing you‚Äôre going to take to the bank from them‚Ä¶No doubt like my other reviews, they will promptly respond (it‚Äôs the only time you will get a prompt response from them) and try to make it sound like they genuinely care, tell you to please call this number and ask to speak to a member of management, they are awaiting your call, blah blah, and it‚Äôs just the EXACT same every day 800 number that you can never get through on or speak to a human. In fact there‚Äôs not even an option to speak to somebody!!! You have to work your way around it going through the back door and picking wrong options. If by some miracle you do get through? The people who pick up the phone don‚Äôt have a freaking CLUE about you or your review! They just make a response to save face and mislead the reader into thinking they care.Walk away from their offers. Better yet? RUN.Update: Like I stated. Less than 24 hours later they have responded and list the same phone number‚Ä¶",5,1

Cash net is the best,I made mistake and sent a payment for the wrong date but customer service was able to change that immediately. They responded back immediately next day and was very helpful.,5,1
Customer service like it used to be the very beginning,"You can get approved for an advance. But, lately you will get a dollar added daily to your balance. Fifty dollars almost cost me 70 in less than a month. I paid it off ASAP! Why the rip off?",5,1

Easy to get funds and fast but interest‚Ä¶,Wow this loan sucks first of all you don't see the APR until you hit the button hidden well let me tell you it is at 275.85 which no person can afford they take out huge payments making it hard to live off of your paycheck. I wished I would of never done this. Lets say it will suck the life out of people struggling and throw them into more debit. RUN AND DON'T PUSH THE BUTTON ACCEPTING THE LOAN IT WILL MAKE YOU IN A MORE IN DEBIT WITH NO WAY OUT SCAM SLIMEBUCKETS. Oh by the way you can never get a person on the phone at the number they provided below to discuss anything. I paid my outstanding balance on Friday before the 15th and they still took that money and 211.00 payment called and they said that we owed to them no matter what I am reporting them to Attorney General this is crap DO NOT USE THIS OR YOU WILL PAY FOR IT MAKES NO DAMN SENSE TO ME IF I PAID IN FULL BEFORE PAYMENT DATE AND THEY STILL TAKE OUT ON THE 15TH.,3,1
Very helpful,Thank you for helping in our emergent need,5,1

Very pleased with there service,"Do not trust this company to give you a loan. I feel into desperation during the covid lock down and heard good things about them so I thought I would try it. My first mistake. I know owe far more money to them than I can even withdraw. I have made every payment on time and in full, yet it is futile because it all just goes to interest. I am almost positive the only way out of this mess is to file for bankruptcy and hope to god that I can pay off what ever the court decides.",5,1
Smoothness of transaction,I got injured not job and very understanding my situation,5,1
Knowledgeable staff,I COULD NOT FIND ANYMORE EXCELLENT PAY DAY LOAN COMPANY LIKE CASH NET USA BEEN DOING BUSINESS WITH THEM OVER 5 YEARS OR SO  AND NEVER ENCOUNTER ANY PROBLEM WITH THEM EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICEI say Goodbye to them because they will no longer offer this product (Payday Loan) here in California,5,1
In my time of need,He was very kind. Helped me out with my orib,5,1
Quick and swiff,That was a problem with url Gmail account all good,5,1
Cashnet has helped me everything I have‚Ä¶,I appreciate but would go again you can help me out of a bun I just need to know when my first payment starts and how do I pay that‚Äôs all I need to know can I do take it out of my account every month that would be easier for me but I need to know a date it will be taken out so I can deduct it from my account,5,1
Your Rep took care of all my Requests,"This company has been a nightmare to deal with. This is the definition of Predatory Lending. First, I implore you to never use this, unless it's a life or death situation. Second, read, read, READ, the agreement so you aren't blindsided by the ASTRONOMICAL amount of DAILY interest they will be charging you. Finally, if you plan on paying them off, DO NOT mail them a payoff check. I did a consolidation loan with my back and a fraction of a fraction of the interest rate, and my bank mailed them 2 checks. One to pay off my account, and one my wife's account. 1 month later, neither accounts are paid off. The check for my wife's account was cashed, but NEVER applied to her account. The check for my account was ""lost,"" and never cashed. To investigate anything they require a ton of leg work from you, and then just tell you to wait.... Which will result in you checking in every few days to only be told to wait more. I still have no resolution on either account. I've resubmitted a check for my account with the cancelled check, and still haven't seen any updates. They still can't find my wife's DEPOSTIED PAYMENT!!! AVOID THIS COMPANY LIKE COVID!!!",5,1
SHOCKED!!,Want to know why company  no longer is loaning  in California,5,1
Nautomotive needseedn towards  gas for job,"The intererest rates are ridiculous, but that is the price you pay when you don't have the best credit and find yourself in an emergency situation.  Plus if you are able to pay more or pay early you greatly reduce the amount of interest you pay. They are however, very up front about the cost so it should never be a surprise.  And the app makes accessing your account and information super easy and if you need money same day as long as you put in your request fairly early you get it the same day.  What I want to brag on in their customer service!  I have always received excellent customer service every time I have reached out with a question or needing assistance over the phone or through the web chat.  Thank you for putting your customers first!",5,1

Received my additional funds on time‚Ä¶,"CashnetUSA sent me a letter in the mail a few days ago out of it seemed no where saying Ive been pre approved for a long up to 1,000. I was applying for loans close to a year ago so I figured they must had my info and thats why they were able to pre approve me. Anyways I was truly so happy when the letter came because it was the perfect amount i was needing for my family at the time and I knew I was going to be able to pay it off quickly. I went online verified my info and entered my routing and account number. It was doing anything when i hit apply so I called just to find out I was not approved but was actually denied and she wasnt able to tell me why. She said it may be because of the bank I use but why would they send letters lying saying your approved for a certain amount when in reality you might not be. It was a lie and really got my hopes up and was so happy thinking i was going to be able to get what I needed for my family. seriously so depressing really sucks",5,1

The representative was polite and‚Ä¶,My first experience was very pleasant. I received an offer in the mail and I was afraid at first because when I usually get offers and apply I‚Äôm always being denied but that wasn‚Äôt the case with CashNetUSA. I went in and applied with my offer and was immediately approved. And the funds were in my account the next day. The reason I‚Äôm given 4 stars and not 5 stars is because the only thing I don‚Äôt like is the amount that is expected to be paid back it‚Äôs kinda expensive but other then that I recommend CashNetUSA to anyone who is in need of extra cash for emergency purposes or you just need the extra cash to help yourself out. My first experience was very exceptional.,5,1
I am satisfied,They will not approve me. First time I was approved but wasn‚Äôt told I needed a checking account so I gave my savings account info bc that was an option.

As long as you make your payments as scheduled there will never be a problem from them. Thanks CashNetUSA for all you do. Much appreciated. R.C.",5,1
Great,Easy approval.  Fast delivery of funds. However I would only recommend small loans. Large loans can turn into financial struggles  especially if you need an extension on a large amount.

Excellent service,"Think twice before borrowing. I took out my loan in 2018 because I couldn‚Äôt afford rent. It did help me not get evicted, but I‚Äôve been having to borrow because the min payments went up and up. It got to the point where from 01/01/2022 to 06/24/2022, I‚Äôve been charged 3574 dollars in interest at 800/mo. You cannot get ahead with this loan. I was finally able to secure a debt consolidation loan, and my balance finally reads zero, but I have lost so much money, over $400 rent. I‚Äôve been there, and I know why you‚Äôre considering borrowing. Just think twice because if you can‚Äôt pay it back and you can only make the minimum payments, you‚Äôll never pay off this debt. I learned my lesson the hard way, not saying don‚Äôt do it. If I hadn‚Äôt, I‚Äôd be homeless but just think twice about it. Also, at least when I first borrowed, it started at $500, then it was raised again and again and again until I was at $2500; if you don‚Äôt have reasonable impulse control, this is not a loan for you.",5,1
Hassle free,Awesome customer service!,5,1

Very Satisfied Coustomer,CashNetUSA.com provided ease of access and personal loan advances in short order.  I won‚Äôt recommend them for most everyone depending upon their financial needs.

Excelent Customer Service,"The initial phone call was great. The representative was informative and knowledgeable, and started setting me up with an account for a loan. Then she clearly gave me instructions about getting on line to complete the loan application.  That when I had some issues. First issue was for almost 25 minutes I didn't get a confirmation code that was to be send to me in my email to verify my email and other information. Then I checked of to allow electronic transfers and supplied them with the name of my bank, routing number and account number. What raised RED FLAGS was when I was asked for my banking user name and password.  At that point I got suspicious because I remember when I opened my bank account years ago to never ever give out my banking user name and password. That's like giving someone absolute and complete access to my bank account/money. Of course I did not give them that particular personal information.",5,1

They don't care about their customers, not even a teeny tiny bit, wait that's not true they do care about their customers money and finding all ways they can to take it from them instead of help them. They are overly greedy and are literally abandoning all of their loyal long term customers to make more money. At least sell the business and start one doing something different instead of ruining it. Do not use this company EVER, they are now AWFUL and untrustworthy and they will make you regret it.

I‚Äôll like to apply for borrow money,"Pro is that they will pre-approve or approve you. No doubt. Con is that the interest is extremely high and it accumulates daily. Every time you think you‚Äôre making progress on repaying your loan, you log in and see they have pretty much added so much interest that you‚Äôre back to the amount of the first week. My advice to you is go somewhere else where they are honest and doesn‚Äôt try to take advantage of you doing a difficult time in life. I definitely would not have applied for a loan from CashNet if I had read the reviews on other sites beforehand.",5,1

They basically say ""hey let me help you right now by giving you a little money but until you pay it all back, we are gonna make surviving hard as hell"" they told me my payments would be $95 then took $330. Then said they can't tell me how much each payment would be.... but why not? Its like a credit card... but I took the full amount it allowed and it said my first payment would be $95.. so shouldn't all my payments be $95 and not $330? Paying off asap. Not a good company to do business with if you can't afford someone just taking what they want from your account.",5,1

Very helpful and understanding,"One 4/28 I called CASH NET USA and asked if I paid my loan off with my debit card , then can I  get a new loan with instant funding , I was told I could DO THIS , NO PROBLEM. WELL That's NOT WHAT HAPPENED ! The very next day 4/29 I called first thing in the morning and paid off my loan but when I tried to get a new loan an incorrect due date appeared, I was still on the phone with the woman and she tells me you will not be able to do your loan today if you need a different due date . Im like but I was told I could do another loan yesterday with no problem , I asked her can you extend the due date by 2 days please so I can take my loan today it is Friday and I need the instant funding because the weekend is coming and I cant get instant funding on the weekend , she again told me I would have to wait until Monday to reapply for my loan. I called back a couple of hours later to ask if I took my loan on Sunday 5/1, when would I receive funding , well THIS NEW WOMAN SAID I COULD HAVE TAKEN MY LOAN THIS MORNING  , FRIDAY AT THE SAME TIME I CALLED AND DID MY PHONE PAYMENT AND THEY COULD GO IN TO MY ACCOUNT AND ADJUST THE DUE DATE FOR ME MANUALLY , SO THE LADY FROM THIS MORNING  WAS WRONG AND BECAUSE OF HER  IT WAS NOW TO LATE IN THE DAY TO DO MY LOAN WITH INSTANT FUNDING AND THAT SHE WAS SORRY . I told her this whole experience was  so awful and that now I would have an additional $100 fee to one of my bills because I would not able to pay my bill due on 5/1 on time because I was not able to get my loan with instant funding so know my payment will be late because I cant get funding until 5/2 all because I was not given the proper information in the first place . I told her I would like to make a complaint because this was not right Im a good customer and I don't deserve this. SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS FILLING OUT A FORM AND THAT THE MANAGEMENT TAKES THESE ISSUES VERY SERIOUSLY AND A SUPERVISOR WOULD CALL ME BACK FOR SURE ON THE SAME DAY , FRIDAY 4/29. TWO DAYS KNOW AND NO ONE EVER CALLED ME BACK SO THIS IS WHY I LEFT A REVIEW TO LET PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THIS COMPANY DID TO ME AND IM A TO GOOD CUSTOMER! CUSTOMERS DO NOT DESERVE TO BE TREATED LIKE THIS AND THEN JUST IGNORED WHEN THEY TRY TO REACH OUT .          UPDATE,  There is nothing you can do now . A supervisor was supposed to call me a couple of days ago and sort this out and try and help me but no one ever reached out and called me back as promised. It was not a supervisor that responded below, it was only customer service . Anyways, it's a little too late to help me now with the instant need I had  last Friday, unfortunately.",5,1

I've also never had any problems with them taking out money before they should, or taking out more than is owed.  When I've had issues paying the loans all at once they very quickly and easily allowed me to split up the payments over time.

Great Associated,"If I could give less then one star I MOST DEFINITELY would!!! This company is the opitomy of a DISHONEST loan shark!!! I sent a cashiers check to pay off my account and first the man on the phone gave me the WRONG address to send the check. I had to call to get the payoff amount. My check was returned to the bank because of the address and my bank said that this it rather customary because it gives them more time to add interest to your account and at 299% yearly that is can be anywhere from a few dollars and up. Mine got up to $15+ a day while waiting for this HORRID company to fix my account...but they STILL want the interest and refuse to fix it. My bank sent the check out a second time to the correct address and CashNet USA cashed my check but then the next month reversed the check off my account but never returned the funds. Also in going over my account VERY CAREFULLY I found MANY discrepencies. There were a few months where they took payment but NEVER posted it to my account or reversed the payment and never returned the monies. On 1/14/21 my year to date interest was $134.70 with $260.42 charged for the month. Then on 2/11/2021 my year to date interest was $1,053.26 with $322.60 charged in interest for the month. I'm not a math teacher but that doesn't add up. I reached out to the company SEVERAL times to fix these issues but to no avail. Finally I gave up...and they stopped harassing me mid 2021. Well a couple months ago I found out that they sent my account to a collection agency for  an unpaid and delinquent account . I had to go back to my bank to get a copy of the cashed cashier's check dated 10/14/2020. I THINK this is finally settled...but the collection agency is not responding to my emails...so who knows. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY...but if circumstances in your life require you to use a cash advance loan shark CAREFULLY and DILIGENTLY go over EVERY statement and transaction!!!

Hassle free,"I was looking to borrow some quick money to solve a problem that has been lingering for almost a year. A friend suggested I try cash net USA , I did and almost immediately I was approved for a loan.",5,1
Great service and professionalism,"I really don‚Äôt appreciate how high the apr is! Completely ridiculous. Instead of being reasonable give those with bad credit a chance at a lower rate. In my opinion most people only want to not pay it off and rip you off due to the fact that they have to pay $3,000 for only $1,000 in the long run if you don‚Äôt pay the loan off the next day you‚Äôll be broke. People with bad credit or in my case brand new credit should be given the privilege of getting such a low apr. Most people with fantastic credit scores are only like that because they got money or it took them there whole life( at least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve seen). I‚Äôm not rich I‚Äôm 18 make little money unless I hit my 60 hour mark. But I‚Äôve got two cars(27,986 and 29,999)three credit cards(Total available credit 750) and never missed a payment in my life, my utilization rate 10%. But I did bring my credit from 300 to 600 in less than 2 months. And yet I‚Äôm still stuck with. 23% apr on both my vehicles. Even know I do everything correct make payments on time. So think of yourself as a company do you want to be the ones that people hate and only thrive for the money than be my guest, a company should thrive for helping there economy, for there people, and for there pride. Sure the company I work for is extremely wealthy one of the wealthiest in the world. But they better the economy, on god there for the people, everything I‚Äôve seen the company do even as a whole has been extremely life changing to me and everyone in this world. Even if they don‚Äôt see it!",5,1

Staff is always knowable  and polite,We applied for a loan to get a little help getting Christmas for our children and got denied... We even received a pre-approval offer in the mail so we go through the steps listed on the offer and once again get denied... It's one thing to be denied but it's totally different to get pre-approval emails and offers in the mail just to be denied yet again!!!!  Thanks for the help NOT!!!! POINT BEING DO NOT SEND APPROVAL LETTERS OUT TO STILL DENY FUNDING!!! This would have greatly helped in getting Christmas for 5 kids.... The initial denial didn't bother me.... It was after I got the pre- APPROVAL offer that I thought I would be able to get them a better Christmas.... In other words I was never APPROVED!!!!!,5,1

THEY ARE GOOD BUSINESS.,CashNet is a scam! They seek out people in need and get you with the hidden interest rates! I only took out a $1000 loan there is no reason I should be paying this company back over $3000. Payments are taken biweekly and as soon as your check deposits into your account. I‚Äôve paid back the loan and then some! I will be closing my account/stopping payment to lock them out! It‚Äôs ridiculous. You basically NEVER PAY THE LOAN OFF. You will be trapped into a vicious cycle! DO NOT TAKE A LOAN FROM THIS COMPANY‚Ä¶. NO MATTER HOW DESPERATE YOU ARE!!!! DO NOT MAKE MY MISTAKE‚Ä¶,5,1
It‚Äôs my first time i using this cash‚Ä¶,"This is my second loan with CashNetUSA. I must say the money is received easy,  But I must say the interest is very high.  I tried to this time to see if I could not have such a high interest rate since I did pay off my first loan.  I just paid on my new loan with almost a 100% interest rate, with that being said, It will take a long time to even get the balance where it can be paid off. This was the problem before.  The help is very welcome. I just do not see why they choose to apply such a high rate. Louisiana is in a health crisis. This company is a good financial platform. Please help people! not make them regret getting a loan from CashNetUSA.",5,1

I feel absolutely humiliated and embarrassed as I've never been the type to ask for anything. My babies have had a rough year we've each had √áovid at separate time's. My husband fought and was injured for this Country, yet it seems This Country has never fought for us. I was trying to do something for them at Xmas because right now we're all they have that care. I've had custody of them for 6 years and although it's a struggle at times ,I'm so Blessed to have them.

Great customer service,Although they provide cash for those who have challenged credit I believe they could do more to retain long term customers. Once customer has good history reward them with lower interest to keep them long-term. Once they have their hooks in you the interest which is extremely high you can't pay it off. So my opinion cashnetusa takes advantage of those in tough spot. Simply greed no way around it. Care about customers before you lose them.,5,1

Good and great,Don't do it it's a trap . Say u can opt out but no u cant sh#t so dam dumb .,5,1
Came right on time would recommend‚Ä¶,"Fake 5 Star Reviews. 95% of these are fake. They are VERY short or what you'd expect from a mass payed rating company. They literally copy and paste their 5 star Reviews. If you get a $2k loan, expect to pay $800 A MONTH. Just a MONTH. That's before your principal payment. Good luck going bankrupt over $2,000.",5,1
Oops,Fast & easy transaction.  They provided a service exactly as advertised.,5,1
Good got my money next day,"So CashNet was very great in the process of allowing me to receive the $2,000 line of credit even with bad credit, so I applaud them on that factor of trust as a consumer. Yes I do understand it was a 2-300% interest of line of credit, but the daily rate charge of $16 for my first billing cycle is just insane. Yes I understand that the interest rate is what it is and due to the loan amount. But at minimum payment of an expected 2 and a half years would have totaled about $12,000 on a $2,000 line of credit. That's ridiculous and better off with a personal loan on a 12 month payment plan. The customer service was more than great trying to answer my understanding of the current pay off amount. Customer service isn't the issue, but the interest rate of the business, (yes I agreed upon) compounded within the first month was just too much. In total, for a $2,000 line of credit I had withdrawn at max in to my account mid August, I paid a total off $2,791. (09/14/2021)‚Ä¶$800 of total fees and APR within the first month. Sure you could pay off more, but that compounded APR DAILY is what gets you. I advise to just get a payday loan, even at $2,000...8 pay day loans paid off after a month would have only been $400. without transfer fees. That's a lot of loans, but even if you only needed say $750. its more reasonable to get a pay day loan than paying $350-250 for 24 months. 3 stars for the great customer service, -2 for the compounded interest. Just get a personal loan or payday loan. Oh and I tried to ask how to close my account on the site Chat with ""Britney"" she gave misleading information. I asked how and she said you can't and the account closes after 7 years of inactivity. I asked ""so you CANNOT close my account after I've paid off the total balance? She said NO.  This is False. After your last payment clears and you're at zero balance owed, you simply call TO CLOSE the account (takes 2-3 business days). Your INFORMATION stays with the company for 7 years. You can close your account after you've paid your total amount.",4,1

Super easy process,I am Grateful for the help but I do not know why my Account is saying outstanding balance of the same amount I got in the first place when I have made 3 on time payment's and yet it is saying outstanding balance for the Amount I got from the beginning it makes no sense it's like I'm paying back 3√ó the amount back and if that's the case I won't be getting anymore money from y'all and will not tell people to go to y'all not when you take WAY MORE than what you give...

Good Customer Service,This is a company that takes advantage of people in need of money.  There was no explanation on the outragious finance charges and how they schedule the payments.

I just discovered that it will take 18 months to pay back $1200 at a rate of $250 to $365 a month to pay back..,5,1

I own 2 business small businesses and I don‚Äôt have paychecks stubs I sent in Every piece of information they needed and here we are 3days later and I still don‚Äôt have an approval or denial.

I couldn't believe that with my low‚Ä¶credit score that thay approved me in just one hour. My money was there the next business day. Thank you Cash net USA.,Unfortunately I don't think they are quite as they seem. Tried them when had offers several other places due to their ads of ease and speed. Not quite the case. Still waiting for an email that was to be sent momentarily. We endured some hurricane damage and needed something fast and were let down by their ads. May want to have back up plan if you have a real need or emergency.I have contacted the number and they could not help. The email showed up days later. Stating basically I had no credit which was the purpose of making a small loan. Anyway the reply is nice but the facts are calling got no answers and was told come back in 30 days? I'll pass. I'm a customer and without us you dont have a business. Most places forget that as they grow. That is unfortunate. Thank you for the computer generated report but not exactly customer service.,5,1

Very,"The customer service has been fantastic overall. I have had to submit  my loan application 3 times, including uploading my paystub. The only emails I have received are to re-sign my application and to resubmit my paystub. I understand the signing and approval need to be done in the same day. When I submit my application at 11am on the second day and the offices don't close until 8pm, one would expect it could be approved in that timeframe. Instead, I received yet another email that my application had been withdrawn.Edit: I have now finally received the approval that my loan will be processed.Edit again: it is now Monday. I started this process on Wednesday. My application was once again withdrawn and had to be resubmitted. The only reason for a second star is the customer service agents are really nice and professional.",5,1

The service was very professional and‚Ä¶,"Was thankful to receive a loan when no one else would extend credit. However, that comes at a price. With a 299% interest rate, it is nearly impossible to pay down quickly; the interest alone made up the majority of my bi-weekly payment. The website is nearly useless, you can't skip a payment or request a payoff there. They say that they were helping people during the pandemic, but I didn't see it. If you skipped a payment, the interest still accrued, and in two weeks, you now have two payments due. If you want to postpone the second one, you have to use their inefficient phone system. Glad that the regulations in Virginia prevents them from doing further business there.",5,1
Very pleased with the service I‚Ä¶,"No different than the other one companies that say 99% approval rate, if y'all have helped 3 million people with your financial services, how many applications have you received in total? I only ask because I know a handful of people that have been denied! I'd bet that 99% could be more like 75% and false advertisment!!!",5,1

I love this company because they are quick to deposit money (same day if requested by 10am), there is no pre-payment penalty, and they don't report to the credit bureaus (unlike credit cards) so an emergency won't drive up your utilization and tank your credit. Their customer service is exceptional! Any time I have called in, the agent has been, kind, friendly, and helpful. A word of warning though. This is NOT a long term solution because the interest is very high. This is more of a stopgap between paychecks tool. Never borrow more than you can comfortably pay back in a month or two!! I do have to say though that their fees are very transparent (costly, but transparent lol) and that if you understand what you are getting into, this loan product can be a life saver!",5,1

I went to the deposit section of my bank and sent several screenshots of all the deposits.  Then i get an email stating it was withdrawn and to fill out the application again. So i do. I sent them a benefit letter for each Social Security direct deposit, and like 8 different screenshots showing those deposits and the direct deposits of each of the pensions. I kept checking today, the 13th. They send me an email once again saying it was withdrawn and to fill out the application again and send a copy of my most recent paystub. Hello? I dont get a paystub.

Excellent,"Cash Net USA sends me a quick review after talking to an agent. I gave them a five star review and then I was let down by Cash Net USA for wiring my loan funds to the wrong, non-existent account. I owe $300 as of today but the funds that were supposed to come into my account was sent out to the wrong account. I am a hotel front desk agent, and what Cash Net USA did was equivalent of me checking a guest into an occupied room. One mistake that is supposed to never be tolerated was made by Cash Net USA. I will no longer do business with Cash Net USA. I do business with a few other payday advance agencies, and none of them have ever sent me money, and ended up funding the wrong account. I wonder what kind of system Cash Net USA uses but there must be quite a lot of holes in their operation.",5,1
Cash net has been very professional and‚Ä¶,The phone person was great.  The company read your paper work very carefully to prpotect yourselfSo at the bottom they want my real feels it says:The top folks must make grat money and I beleive the old saying them that has money makes money.

Now I can breathe easier because she handled my account with expertise and with something I can live with. She also answered a question about an email I received using their name.

Excellent fast and friendly service.,"*BEWARE*I was in the process of applying for a loan but the man on the other end of the phone had a strong accent and very hard to understand really made me jump through many fire hoops trying to get my loan in motion, and after dealing with this guy for at least 2+ hours stressing me out so bad only for him to rudely hang up on me. When i tried calling him back I got a message that said the number is no longer in service. So in conclusion...I gave this guy ALL my personal info that in the end I didnt get a loan (that i was approved for) and was left in a state of anger and confusion. Sincerely,A pissed off person!!I would NEVER recommend this so called company to anyone!! *BEWARE*",5,1

I can't give you an honest review‚Ä¶,"Well, after filling up their application online,  got approved for a $200 cash advance and signed loan documents as well.  They backed up and told me that they can't use unemployment benefits as income. I explained the agent about starting my own thing from home after certification with Arise.  This week started doing doordash and Papa as an extra income as well. He still denied it and told me that i can apply again after working 30 days with an employer.  i told him that after working 30 days with an employer i certainly know where not to go :) and that i don't have employers i am my employer.  Please if you can choose another place to get your funds from, do it. I really thought this pandemic would teach us all a lesson but it seems some learned and some just got worse.

VERY PLEASANT TO SPEAK WITH DURING THIS PANDEMIC SEASON. THE ECONOMY IS UP & DOWN. SOME OF US NEED EXTRA HELP. HOWEVER, WHATEVER THE PROBLEM IS WITH CLIENTS APPLYING FOR A DIFFERENT AMOUNT THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR IN TEXAS AND CAN'T RECEIVE NEEDS TOO BE FIXED. I HAVE CALLED IN ABOUT THIS ON 3 SEPARATE OCCASIONS. THERE HAS BEEN NO ACTIVE OR REAL EFFORT BY CASHNET USA TO RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM. I HAVE BEEN A CLIENT FOR YEARS. SO WHY SEND LITERATURE SAYING I AM ELIGIBLE FOR SOMETHING YET YOU TRY TO PACIFY ME  BY MAKING SOME LAME EXCUSE AND FORCE  ME TO ACCEPT THE LESSER AMOUNT WHILE CLAIMING THE PROBLEM IS BEING FORWARDED TO TECHNICAL SUPPORT. I AM GOING TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER AND REPORT THIS ISSUE TO SOMEONE WHO WILL GET TO THE GIST OF THE PROBLEM. WHY PUT IT OUT THERE AND HAVE NO INTENTION ON DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT? IT IS UNFAIR. IT DOES NOT GIVE ME THE SAME RIGHTS, PRIVELEGES AS OTHER CLIENTS. I HAVE BEEN LOYAL TO THIS COMPANY. I HAVE PAID BACK THE EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF INTEREST RATE EVERYTIME..SO,WHEN IS THE COMPANY GOING TO LIVE UP TO THE GOALS AND MISSION STATEMENT IT IS ADVERTISING TO THE CONSUMER? EVERYONE SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO BORROW  WHAT THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR IRREGARDLESS OF WHAT INCOME BRACKET THEY MAY HAPPEN TO BE IN AT THE TIME. WE ARE STILL IN A PANDEMIC. YOU CAN STILL CATCH THE VIRUS. PEOPLE STILL DON'T HAVE JOBS. FOR SOME CASH NET USA MAY BE THE ONLY BEACON OF HOPE THEY CAN DEPEND ON TO HELP THEM.",5,1

Not to mention the 1000 email I now have saying my funds are ready.  They are a joke. Lies besides the all look like different companies but nope  all link back to one.

Great service,I absolutely love this company. Because of their service I was able to keep my small business afloat through the worst of the covid pandemic. Every time I have spoken with someone they have been extremely helpful and very professional. I would recommend anyone with a small business to use this CashNetUSA. Not every day goes as planned and sometimes you have something happen where you need just a little boost to get by or have the need to have a bit more cash on hand. For example if one of my suppliers runs a special and I need a few hundred I can have it in my bank the next day to take advantage of the offer. I travel a lot. If I needed a set of tires and am a little tight on cash - bang it's there the next day. Depending on the time of day it can be there by end of that business day.,5,1

Always on time,"Cashnet was there when I needed to pay the rent but didn't have the money to do so. The application process was easy. If I needed to change a payment that was easy too. The down side is you don't have a fixed payment. It changes every month depending on your balance. You have to double check when changing your due date, that it doesn't cause you to have two payments the 1st month. The interest rate is high. Those are the only downsides. The customer service is very friendly & knowledgeable. It's easy to draw from funds available.",5,1

Was helped Thur the process went‚Ä¶,I have been a customer of CashNetUSA for years.  I rarely leave a review but I am so grateful to this company for years of excellent service. When I first came to CashNetUSA I had no credit and it was right after Hurricane Ike. I applied for a payday loan to help replace the food etc that I lost in the disaster once our power came back up.  I didn't think I would get approved as I had no credit at all. They approved me and it was a lifesaver.  I have been a loyal customer ever since and they have been there through emergencies etc and now I have my first credit card in 25 years. If you find yourself in a bind and have no where to turn do yourself a favor and reach out to them.  Borrow what you can afford to pay back and pay your loan off and they will be loyal to you and there when you need them.  Everyone needs help every now and then.  I am so very thankful CashNetUSA was there when I needed them especially being on a fixed income.  THANK YOU CNU!!!,5,1

Excellent,"I have been a loyal paying customer for a long time and never missed a payment.  For some reason for the last two payments, they have not given me credit for the rate reducer.  Meaning 5/6 next payment 6/6 and then 10% reduced off interest.  The rate reducer has not changed for two months staying at 5/6. I have tried my best to resolve the issue by chat and the company seems not to care.I pay 680 a month for a 2500 loan and have never been late.  Yes, I realize the crazy interest, but I am in a trap and doing my best to pay it off on top of the interest.",5,1

It's everything it says it is,"(06/21/2021)UPDATE: So I made a payment of $130 on my account and my payment amount wasn‚Äôt close to the amount I paid.  I contacted CASHNETUSA customer service to update my banking info so that payments wouldn‚Äôt fail and when I get into a chat a rep named ‚ÄúALEX‚Äù was very unprofessional after I reached out to them after making a payment he/she insisted on telling me this is an attempt to collect a debt... I still have credit to draw from and Alex may need some very extensive training as this type of behavior or service will run away consumers that intend to pay their debts.  Not only this, if my account is in good standing and I have a LOC to draw from why are you throwing debt collection in my face.  This is a result of poor training and not only this your agent ended the chat not caring about what I had to say. I recently got approved for my SBA loan and I will be giving the $1000 back that I borrowed. It‚Äôs not worth keeping a line of credit.  Hey All! Small business owner here who never expected to have to take out a loan after so many lucrative years as a stylist and small business accountant. Still awaiting the SBA I swallowed my pride and applied with cashnetusa because my credit score is only around 644. The app process was quick and easy and was approved in literally 20 minutes for a line of credit.  Thank you so much CashNet, you were literally a safety net for me and my family, you will never know how much you‚Äôve helped me and my business.",5,1
The customer service and fast response‚Ä¶,"I can not believe the amount of positive reviews for cash net. First of all, before I go on my rant I will say I haven‚Äôt found myself in a payment bind nor have I had any experience working with their customer service team. My review is strictly off of the 275.85% yearly APR, and In addition multiple other daily fees. If you are in a life and death situation I‚Äôd say go for it (bc how worst can it get), but you are literally paying whole car note payments . Most of your bi weekly payment is interest. I was initially paying 4-500 dollars monthly on $1,600 loan with barely no movement in the loan going down. Now I owe $1100(paid extra on one of the payments ) which is $330/monthly payment. So I‚Äôll be doing what I didn‚Äôt want to do and pull out of my 401K to pay this off this loan this week because this loan will never get paid off. you would literally have to pay twice the monthly amount to see any difference.Please listen and stay away. This is an expensive trap that you will kick yourself in the leg for later. I‚Äôm thankful my credit situation has turned itself around. üôèüèæ",5,1

Very good in helpful in friendly‚Ä¶,"Ms. Lynn was:1.	Courteous2.	Empathetic  3.	Professional Lastly, I have to say that NONE of the (stated) ‚Äútraits‚Äù are possible if a person does not practice the ‚ÄúART‚Äù of LISTENING.  Ms. Lynn is an EXCELLENT listener. I had ONLY to advise her of my issue ONCE; and before I could ‚ÄúMake Perfectly Clear‚Äù the reason for my call, I was advised ‚Äú‚Ä¶Sir, if you were to check your account presently‚Ä¶you will find the ‚Äò‚Ä¶stated issue resolved‚Ä¶‚Äù.

They were very profesional and‚Ä¶,They are an excellent company.,5,1
Amazing and fast,They will be willing to help you when you need some financial help. Thank you CashNetUSA.,5,1
Fast and easy,I have a $1300 credit line. I have paid it off twice. Interest rates are extremely high but it was to be expected however there's no penalty for early pay off and will save you money paying it off in full early. They gave me a chance when no one else would. The downside is they don't report to your credit so even if you've maintained a good payment history and available credit it won't better your credit score. I would give a higher review if they reported.,5,1
Efficient process and fast response,Incompetent!! I was approved for a payday loan and they sent it to the wrong bank account!! The account number was completely wrong! I call costumer service and they tell me to wait for the funds to be refused by the other bank and then call again tmrrw to check and then apply again on Thrusday when I get paid Friday! Completely defeats the purpose of a payday loan. I do not recommend this Incompetent company!!,5,1
Very helpful when I needed money right‚Ä¶,I called CashNetUsa concerning loan avialability and all my questions were answered with complete confidence and I am looking forward to use their services,5,1
Cash Net USA is The Best!,The flex loan was there when I needed it. I like the fact that you can get your money same next day in most cases. I hated that you had to pay bi-weekly and that the amount to pay was extremely high and the balance barely moved. I was paying almost $700 a month for $1800 borrowed so you would think $700 a month would knock down the balance but it didn‚Äôt and then they continue to add interest daily. Use this temporarily not long term!!,5,1
Never any problems,Thank you Tracy for your help today! You totally get customer service!,5,1
Great service,"I appreciate the ability to get the money I needed at the time. I just wish it wasn't at such a high rate of interest. Repayment is guaranteed because the account it's on is set up with my direct deposit and is well established. I've been paying for 5 months and have payed two thirds of what I borrowed and buy out is still more than I  borrowed.  It's disheartening.  However when your credit is bad from medical, past partners, and grown children what do you do?",5,1

It will only make things worse....................,5,1
Helped me when I needed it the most,"I wish I could give negative scoring they apparently have no cyber security, our account number and information was given out. We were sent threatening letters to pay amount or that we would be sued and wages garnished. I have made all payments on time!! This company has made thousands from me over time. My husband thought he was helping and paid it in full 1145.00. The law firm is legitimate and Has your exact customer ID. Clearly your information is NOT safe here. Way to pay back what once was a loyal customer with excellent payment history!! I will NEVER do business with this company again, I work way too hard for my money. I could cry right now!!!! The worst part is the monthly payments will keep coming out for this horrible company that leaks your info soYou can be robbed of you hard earned money. I don‚Äôt know how these people live with themselves preying on people in a tough spot!!! DONT DO IT STAY AWAY YOU WILL REGRET!!!!",5,1

The only complaint I have is when you ‚Ä¶,"As single person struggling as is, this was my worst decision ever. My car broke down, and started a new job because of COVID 19. So I didn‚Äôt have enough money to cover my bills and pay to fix my car. So I want with company from how great the reviews were. I got my cash really fast, which was great. However the interest is crazy! And they charge you interest  everyday. They don‚Äôt care if you have never missed a payment. I had only received the loan for $500. I have paid them so far $915.98, and they still say I have $368.45 out standing balance. And I got this loan originally in 8/14/2020, and I have not borrow from them since. So please don‚Äôt use this company, it‚Äôs not worth it. If you are strapped for cash. Try another company I will not use this company ever again or recommend it to anyone",4,1

I had some unexpected expense and this‚Ä¶,"At first I was super skeptical about working with CashnetUSA based on some of the reviews I read online. However, I was in a pinch and had no other options at the time. Although the interest is a little outrageous I received the funds I needed within 24 hours of the initial contact. I hit some bumps in the road when some of my due dates come up a few different times. Each time I contacted them and they helped set up payment arrangements that were easily affordable.Each and every one of the representatives I spoke to over the phone or chatted with online were all very helpful, knowledgeable, friendly, and empathetic to my situation, but most of all understanding that I too was a human being with actual issues. They also understood they were not the only bill I had to pay and Rent, Groceries, and Gas were more important to pay.  They also have options which allow you to pay off your loan or line of credit early. This for me was an excellent option because some companies do not allow you to payoff early because they want every penny they can squeeze out of you. If you are in a pinch and need some help quickly I would recommend CashnetUSA.",5,1

This was an easy experience,Listen after everybody gets lost and the huge corporate society and then they try to get a small issue resolved and they get shuffled through a bunch of doors unfortunately this is the way The larger corporate hast to work when you make a phone call to a company to resolve the problem you never get the top management you always get that in between the go-between but they have to deal with their manager but that‚Äôs not the end product dirt management goes to another higher level OK so everyone please understand it takes time to go through steps but in this case it took me at least six weeks to finally get to the fourth stepAnd they could not find any evidence to dispute what I felt they should‚Äôve changed they changed it they gave me the needed refund they also call back to give me the needed apology and to wish me luck and health in the future and hoping that they can further help give me more guidance and support in the future which is about all that she can ever ask of the days multilevel corporate structures so what does it say I take my hat off waving salute to Cash Net America USA and I was like I said we thank you for your support,5,1

Responded to my needs and gave my‚Ä¶,Excellent service.,5,1
The service was awesome,Please do yourself a major disappointment and STAY AWAY from this company.  They will not disclose the actual terms of the loan prior to closing.  Once close they will charge you approx. $8 a day per 1000 loaned.  So pay $300 monthly (actual pmt higher) meaning $240 interest pmt.  If paying minimum payments would take in excess of `1 yr to payoff. STAY AWAY - DON'T USE - TELL EVERYONE - BIG BIG RIPOFF,5,1

Trustworthy Company!!,I made a mistake by applying for a loan with this company. I then find out they don‚Äôt offer loans in my state. It‚Äôs been a few months now and I received an email from their collection department saying I owed more than $600. This email said they had my email and SSN. It said they tracked my IP address. Of course they have my info I applied but I replied to the sender letting them know which state I lived in and wanted all info pertaining to the loan sent to me I didn‚Äôt hear anything else. Don‚Äôt give them your information,5,1
Very quick to respond,"They are good for very short term, if you are late you will be in the hook and will pay 3 times what you owe.",5,1
Great service!,Excellent thank you so much,5,1
Easy loan!,The fees are triple of a normal check loan on lines of credit.  They do have customer service after you get a $500 interest fee if you have questions. I believe I've paid $1600 in fees and interest in 80 days on a $1500 LOC. They put you in collections the same day your fees are due by 5 pm that day if you haven't made the payment. They prefer ach so they can force your bank. I thought it would be like a higher interest credit card but Cash Net managed to far out pace a bad credit card in fees. Luckily I can pay for this mess but alot of people wouldn't. Their only possible business plan would have to be to get as much in interest as possible before you quit playing it or go bankrupt.,5,1
Helpful at service,They helped me very fast and efficiently!,5,1
Good but I need more money than what I‚Ä¶,Received a call from cash net today and the woman on the other end asked if I had any question about my loan. I didn't but she did give me a little information about my loan. She was very pleasant to talk to and I believe she is an asset to cash net.,5,1

survey,"I‚Äôve been a customer with this lender well over seven years. Initially they were awesome, however now they are horrible. It states that you can get same-day funding after paying off your loan if you reapply by 10:30 AM Eastern time. Unfortunately they are not submitting the information to Veritec in the state of Michigan in a timely manner. Therefore you are not able to reapply until after 3:30 PM and funds are not sent to your account until the following business day which would be Monday.This is definitely misleading and false advertisement.  State the truth to the customers informing them that if they live in a state where Veritec has to approve the loan let them know it‚Äôs not gonna happen until after 3pm so stop saying same-day funding.!!!!!!",5,1
GREAT,Don‚Äôt waste your time. If you can‚Äôt pay this loan off on one lump sum then all your monthly payments go straight to interest. I‚Äôve made multiple payments and zero have went to principle. It‚Äôs robbery,5,1
I was very well pleased with the whole‚Ä¶,"Save yourself the turmoil and find cash another way. This is a debt pit with incredibly high interest rates which ensure longevity of payment essentially doubling what you would pay from other trusted sources.

At a time when I really needed some‚Ä¶,"CashNetUSA is an awesome source of financial support. I know there is great risk for the company, but the interest rates are insane!

They took time out and got what I need‚Ä¶,Giving the lowest rating because I filled out an application online and I made a mistake and didn't put the bank account number correct and Cashnet sent the money to the wrong account number. I fault Cashnet partially because it was a 10 digit account number and accounts have 12 digits so how am I supposed to pay it back and never received the money? I have called about every few days explaining the mistake I made and never received the money but it is still charged to me. It was a 10 digit account number which isn't even valid for any bank. Calls to customer service and the bank isn't a help because I am still held for the money I never received. How is it my bill? I never received the money,5,1

Handled my questions very fast and they‚Ä¶,"These people are crooks. If you're looking cash in a bind with no high interest rates I urge you to try LendUp or Speedy Cash.

As soon as they switched to installment loan option I was done. You will end up paying 10x or more what they loan you. I urge you to PLEASE go else where and stay far away from these crooks.",5,1

Cashnet USA was really there when I‚Ä¶,"I made the unfortunate decision to borrow money from these leeches in 2019. The interest rates are ridiculously high and I paid them back in full in September of 2019. I just received a letter in the mail January 2021 about how they've sent me to collections on a $350 debt that I don't owe. I took pictures and documented everything and I paid them off IN FULL. They said they only credited $1000 even though my bank account shows that it was charged more than that for the full month. Every time I try to call the people are completely useless. Their customer service is just as atrocious as their 300% interest rates. If they were going to send me to collections for a debt I already paid, why wait a year and a half? Were they hoping I would forget about it so they could get more money from me? This is the worst place I have ever done business with and I'm not paying a penny more to them.Edit: I've called twice and the customer service reps refused to help me and all they did was tell me to call collections. They said they could only drop it if I get a letter from cashnetusa  saying that my debt was paid in full which you refuse to do. My debt was $1,133.44 and I paid you $1,134. They only credited my account with paying $1,000, so did you pocket the extra $134? I even called cashnetusa THAT DAY and they said I paid it off. When I called collections they said you sold my ""debt"" to collections 9 days after I paid it off, but I just got a letter about it THIS MONTH, almost a year and a half later saying I owe $350. So, no. I won't be calling your joke of customer service. What I will do is go to the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Consumer Affairs. Cashnetusa is nothing but a bunch of criminals.",5,1
Outstanding and I appreciate it all.,Great company to do business with and the associates are very helpful and nice. Can't get any better.,5,1
I applied for a loan and it was a fast‚Ä¶,"I was given a loan and the loan was to be paid back on the 31st of Dec. as the New Year was coming. I took the advice of a chat person that it was and or should be paid that being my pension check that gets paid on the 3rd every month. But for some reason, it did not until the 4th of Jan. So because Cashnet tried to pull money out where there was none I was charged $25 bY the bank and then $25 from CashNET. I am taking the responsibility for this as it was explained how they take and or when they take the funds and how it is my responsibility to watch for this and be able to connect with Cashnet before the problem arises. So when it was time for me to sign the document at the end I should have said something then and hoped for a better outcome when I  Fingers crossed that soon my portfolios can be released  mm",5,1

Great money was in my bank account as‚Ä¶,"This is the third time I have used this company. I have never experienced any problems with obtaining a installment loan. However, this time I was only given the choice of a cab loan. The amount was over the amount I needed to borrow and it would not allow me to apply got a lesser amount. Secondly, if they looked at my pay now compared to the last time, it was decreased which means I couldn‚Äôt afford the larger amount! Also. In my business with them, I have never applied for a large amount! I have always kept it between $500-$600. I am very disappointed in the company. I needed the money to help with medical costs. I will go elsewhere for a loan and will not do any more business with this company again! We are in a pandemic and even the businesses that you have established a relationship with have upped their amounts!! It‚Äôs more or nothing at all!!!",5,1

She helped me solve my problem,This is predatory lending at its finest.

Fast and easy,The only thing I don‚Äôt like is the ability to pay your loan off isn‚Äôt on the app. The other loan apps have this option.

I am a long time customer,"I was approved for a loan today but they are sending it to the wrong account!! Where did they get that information?! I don‚Äôt have a chase account!!!! And the numbers are no where near my banks routing and account numbers so no, it‚Äôs NOT a typo! What a scam! I‚Äôm contacting the better business bureau IMMEDIATELYUPDATE: I called them today after receiving an email saying that I was not approved even though I got an email yesterday saying I was approved. This thing is a whole mess they said back in 2007 I applied for a loan with them and I used  a JP Morgan Chase bank account at that time. Well that is not the bank that I used when I applied yesterday. I don‚Äôt have that bank account anymore and haven‚Äôt since 2007. So they took it upon themselves to try send my loan to a closed bank account. I was advised this morning to wait until January 8th for Chase Bank to reject the loan. This place is the only source where they have a decent review rating. Everywhere else people have nightmares dealing with them...makes me wonder. So now I need to wait until the 8th and  pray that I don‚Äôt become one of the nightmare stories of them hounding me for money that I never received. Do your research!My Customer #11343840My full name is Chiemeri Collins. I am a real customer. I received an email today asking me to verify that information like anyone would make up something like this..",5,1

Thank you guys I needed this hood news‚Ä¶,Many of us know and have experienced the difficult world of trying to get money when you need it.

Very good experience  highly recommend,WORSE experience  EVER with a loan place!! If I could go back od go to a credit union  or something.  This place called me made arrangements and still ignored my arrangement. My child was in the hospital for 3 wks got out WOTH COVID (3wks Emergency surgery appendicitis then went back bc they nicked colon then on release day found out she was pos. For covid FROM HOSPITAL.) SO obviously no work while child is in hospital.  So the lady acted like she understood and would help but after phone call they took part of rent money then I call and there's NO notes of my arrangements so SOMEONE didn't do THEIR job and MY Family suffers. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!!,5,1

It was simple and great respone,Horrible customer service once you have paid down your balance and are not asking for more money. I have been told for at least 3 months that my account is in review which means they lock your account and do not allow you to see statements. I have never missed a payment.  I have called and emailed and my issue remains unresolved.,4,1
I love how fast and convenient CashNet‚Ä¶,Cashnet is the best out there. Staff is friendly and answers all my questions.,5,1
Great job.,"Every time That I inquire about the best time to make an additional payment that will go towards my principle balance, I am never given a straight answer.  I just paid over $1100.00 towards my balance in a 10 day time period and only $600 went towards my principle.  That is ridiculous!!!!  I made the extra payments to bring down my principle balance but the way they have these loans set up is to take as much principle up front as possible.  Which prevents anyone from paying them down quickly.  They are never able to tell me when is the best time to make an additional payment that benefits me.  Total SHAM!  How anyone can give this company a rating above one star seems suspect to me.  I do not believe that these are legitimate ratings.",5,1
Although I wasn't approved for what I‚Ä¶,Not very helpful. I just tested positive for corona and asked for a 2 week forgiveness while I quarentine and they basically gave me the finger. Cashnet doesn't have your well-being in mind.,5,1
No fuss,"CashnetUSA is a reliable loaning partner. Any questions are answered by their reliable, considerate and knowledgeable representatives.",5,1

Interest is a little high but what do you expect. Nothing's free nowadays LOL. If you're in the gym and they need a quick cash I highly recommend,5,1
Nothing negative to say Lisa was‚Ä¶,"This company does provide you money quickly and without a big hassle. The money is direct deposited in your account within 24 to 48 hours and you make payments based on your pay cycle. It is unfortunate that it is not clearly explained how expensive it is to get a loan or line of credit from them. The interest is accrued daily on the outstanding balance of the loan. The annual APR is 299%. Yes!!  My advice is to read the fine print, ask questions, tough it out, go to your local bank. This was by far one of the worse mistakes I have ever made getting a line of credit while going through medical crisis, recovering from family related COVID-19, and struggling with financial hardship to pay for medical bills .",5,1

Great and helpful,"Yeah, you get the money but their site isn't built with the customer in mind.  If you want to do anything, you have to call/get support because their site doesn't explain anything, nor does it allow you to get anything done with your loan, other than have it paid on the initial paydate or extensions. I wanna pay early but everytime I try, it never let's me & always claims there's an issue with my card/bank but somehow it works perfectly fine for them to withdraw it on the date they chose...

He has  options on how they will deposit from my bank account the said $7k and prior to it they will send me first initial deposit bcoz according to them my score was a little low and they want to boost it by me spending that amount to buy a gift card from bestbuy, wallmart, cvs or kroeger to return back the amount they deposited in order to boost my score and then deposit the total loan amount.

Helpful,"I regret taking a loan from themI regret taking a loan from them. I took $1,550 last year and today 11/30/2020 I called them and asked how much I already paid, they said, 3,048.00 and still owe them around $700 according to customer service, This company is not helping people but drowning them more in debts. Honestly is putting me in a worse situation then I already was in. Paying them 2x a month and getting an interest of 100% is not enough. It's killing me. Just a lesson learned. After paying them $3000 for a year I still owe $700??? This company is a thief!!!! I hope the management will rot in hell.",5,1

I put in my information but each time a I pushed Submit it was not accepted. so I could not complete the app. But Cash Net USA did not know this. so I will have to wait 30 days before I can apply to them again for a loan. My Bank noticed a lot of recurring charges on my account that I did not authorize and four of them were from credit score reporting sites. They had been charging my acc. $34.98 each month. My Bank made them put it back. I thank the site I was sent to was one of them.and that's why I could not submit to get my credit score. I called Cash Net USA and they explain to me clearly why I could not complete there app, and gave me some good advice about applying for a loan. And also what to look out for. I am very pleased with I was treated. Even though I have to wait 30 days before I can apply to them again. I don't have that much time, but if I did I would wait. I like the way they do business.",5,1

This should bring the balance down and possibly my payments..wrong my balance would go up like i said $3-$4 and my payment fluxed between same $10. I hate when large companies think its okay to take from a needing hard honest bill paying person. Who has NEVER missed a payment OR EVEN ASKED FOR AN EXTESION DURING THE COVID PANDEMIC. Wow...really CNUSA jst replied a vague response. Im nit complaining about the contract. Im upset that upon my 2nd and 3rd issue of money your company stole from me.

Fast and easy,299% apr. Daily rate nearly 10 percent. Please be careful out there. Ask your friend and  family beg them if you must. Pay them as of you would those lenders and pay them on time. Do not ever miss a payment to put your family in a bad spot. 0 interest (potentially) Pay your family first. Before you pay lenders like CashNetUSA who will take advantage of you financial situations. They will ask you why you need it and then spit on your face with an offer you absolutely can't refuse.  Please watch out.,4,1

Shame on cash net USA and I don‚Äôt recommend this company it‚Äôs bogus! Send me all types of offers in the mail but when I attempt to apply I get turned down from doing a freaking application!

But did  I have a Warrant out for my arrest.  I called CashNetUSA, immediately still trying to stop shaking and breath.  Their representative was great, had me read the whole letter to her.  We went over my Payments everything fine. She helped me calm down and let me know no Warrant. No judgement nothing. Thank God for a company that has real people on the phone and was able to help me.

always helpful,Cashnet reduced my available credit shortly after covid 19 shut down a lot of places. Even though my income was not affected at all. Nothing changed for me. They just reduced my amount available for no reason. When people needed help the most Cashnet failed to help. This is the worst kind of company. Instead of being there for their customers they made getting money harder. Don't do business with this company if you care about companies that are actually there for their customers.,5,1

Excellent customer service!,CashNet is there when I need them and it is super easy and fast.,5,1
My experience with CashNetUSA has be‚Ä¶,"If you are desperate enough to use cashnetusa you should probably rob a bank. You won't get screwed in prison as hard as cashnetusa will screw you. I had used a different service and expected the fees would be similar, but cashnetusa charges much higher fees and they start the interest on day 1. No chance to avoid the interest by paying in full within a month, they are hammering you from the very start. But the absolute worst thing they do is they hold your payment so they can continue charging their exorbitant interest. Made a payment 2 days ago, they acknowledge the payment was made, but my balance does not reflect it and the 8 bucks a day in interest keeps getting charged.",5,1
That was right on time thanks alot that‚Ä¶,The service was very quick. It didn't take long at all. I will use them again. Thank you for your service.,5,1
Easy things I ever did,"Customer Service Representatives were all so helpful and professional. The approval process went through effortlessly, and the customer service representative walked me through the process with so much patience. Got funds exactly when promised.",5,1
The representative was very helpful,This company has been drafting payments from my account for over a year..on the wrong day. When I changed jobs my payday changed but they would not change it to match. This has caused countless amounts of overdraft fees for me. I have reached out to them several times to help. But they won't.  This has to be unlawful.  I think I'm going to seek some legal help.,5,1
easy to use and set up,"You guys deposited the money into my account much sooner than I though, and I truly appreciate that being as how I needed some financial help right away.",5,1

Nothing happened,The customer service is amazing! I was having issues on my online account so I called and they had the issue fixed in under 5 minutes! Highly impressed.,4,1
It‚Äôs really fast and easy to get it done,I got a loan last year when my car broke down . They increased my limit and I always make on time payments. If you have the money to pay them off instantly then sure . But making monthly payments is a no. My BI WEEKLY PAYMENTS were 250. A piece so 500 overall. My loan was for 1700. No matter how much I paid or did I could NOT pay it off. I also asked for a settlement offer just anything to get this debt off me and account closed. Customer service informed me that they don‚Äôt do settlement offers which I‚Äôm sure is a lie. Anyways I did some debt consolidation and just paid the whole thing off and I hope to never deal with these ppl again . Definitely would not recommend as a lender . The high interest rate makes it impossible for you to pay them off. Yesterday my payoff was 1823 and today my payoff was 1872 . Please unless you‚Äôre seriously desperate do not go this route ! There are definitely better lenders with lower interest . Good luck,5,1
Fast,"Very helpful, fast and got me what I needed.",5,1

As long as you use it responsibly you‚Ä¶,Easy to get approved but the interest rates are ridiculous! 276% interest rate on a 1200 loan!

Pay off quickly!,Very helpful & fast right on time with my needs. Needed help with bills & food & got the loan within 20 minutes,3,1
Karen was the best she explained‚Ä¶,"Absolutely ridiculous. I was approved for $800 yesterday and was told I would get the funds by end of business day. I realized I may have made a mistake on my account number so I chat with someone and I give them the proper account number who then confirms it as correct. Awhile later I hadn't gotten my funds yet so i called and gave my account number to confirm, they also said it was correct. I called back one more time not understanding why NY funds are not in the account just to find out, it wasn't the right account number. I tried giving her the right number and was told I couldn't, and it could take up to 5 business days to correct then error. Is this some kind of scam to get my social security number, bank info. Etc??? U can either deposit it on the right account as I asked or I can take it up on social media, the new, or better yet my father works for a radio station out here called The Fox. They do the Chiefs games which hundreds of thousands of people watch and listen to just for that one on day. I am not threatening, but I need that money asap",5,1

Excellent services and willing to‚Ä¶,"They're okay for when you need quick cash. I've been in a bind since COVID happened and had a few medical bills pop up that I needed to get rid of. However, I will say that the amount that you pay back is crazy. I've paid on them up to four times now, and haven't really seen the numbers go down. When I asked them why it was that I didn't have any line of credit for how many times, and the large amounts that I've paid them, they said it was because the majority of the payment goes towards fees. Which is insanely crazy. I should have looked into it more before making my move with them. I wouldn't so much as recommend them unless you are really desperate for help and need funding quickly.",5,1

Always have been helpful with my‚Ä¶,Fast response time and no hassel with getting information needed to complete loan. Thank you for your help!,5,1
CashUSA has given good and honest‚Ä¶,Cost me over $200 to borrow 600 for 2 weeks. Loan sharking at its best. Contacting the attorney general. Will never use them again. That's what I get for being a valued customer.,5,1
Fantastic customer service,"I have been a customer with cash net for about a year. Everyone is Very helpful, specially in these hard times. 5 star from me. Plan on staying with them for a long time!",5,1
Thank you Kayla very professional‚Ä¶,"The good is getting the loan, or not.The interest can be high and tends to grow quite rapidly. But my main issue is rate of repayment and due date.For example, if you are paid bi-monthly on the 15th. and 30th. CashNetUSA due dates fall around the 11th. and the 28th, this can cause you to get hit with an NSF. If you're not watchful, you'll find yourself borrowing more just to meet the minimum payments and find yourself worse off than before.Stuff happens so it's good to shop around and not only read but comprehend the fine print before signing. It's best to have a plan to pay your loans back as soon as possible and doing so can make this a good experience.",5,1
I was helped tremendously in my moment‚Ä¶,good afternoon im happy that thank u again other again....smile have a good day,5,1

Perfect!!!,I know this for fact .our own government would rather give businesses that have money and resources business loans but those of us that's busted our tails never ask for a penny from anyone ever .but cash net had no problem giving me money to survive I may have to even use my credits each month but I'm living barely but thankful even paying 1000% better than what out government has offered.so quite gripping see what you get from the government I promise you will thank cash net too.,5,1

Excellent company,"I have taken loans from cash net USA  for over 4 years. made all payments on time. they charge up to 1000 present interests...today they refused to approve a stinking $250 loan...I do not know why I have good credit ...I told them to remove me from their system...due to many people complained to the BBB that their information got out to criminals... but they refused, they are evil...stay away from them. I went to a loan company online the name is RISE , got a loan on the spot interest rate was 28%....  I was stupid to work with them as the charge not 299% interest but over a 1000%.as you see their response ...they have no answer...and they did not address any of my complaints ...I am working on revoking their license in my state as many other states already did.",5,1

I have used cash net on different‚Ä¶,"Super fast and easy to use. So far, I have had no issues with CashNet.  During a 6 month period, my loan amount possibilities were lowered with no reason, then poof, today was listed more than ever borrowed b4. Interest rates are morbidly high everywhere, but so are other payday loans. Another company suckered me into a line of credit. My bad for asking for help...During this time, and the economy, this company, (any loaning facility), is, are taking advantage of the vulnerable at this time with interest at 299%+.Cmon, really?! I tend to do the monthly loan, yeah, the $50ish fee for just doing a few bucks for a couple hundred. Banks r constantly being bailed out, but we have to beg for help becuz the banks, and all lending companies, interest charges are ridiculous. I know it would be a cold day in hell b4 any money lending agency, gives a break in interest rates, or lowers interest payouts. We can all just dream that little dream until we are all starving... then who is going to borrow money then?",5,1

Great company,Cash Net USA was easy they explained what they were doing and what to expect.,5,1
My experiences with cashnet have been‚Ä¶,"This is the 2nd review I am given this Company.I have been using this Company for more than 2 years i had been getting the 1800.00 payday loan.Then Covid 19 came and they discontinued it and only had 500.00 loans which don't help me very much if I need to fix something in my house or car.Anyways I really just thought the World of Cashnet USA until....two days ago i looked at the loans and they had put the 1800.00 payday loan back.Well i called and i applied online too to sign documents.My Plumbing in the back yard is leaking really bad and I need it fixed last 2 weeks i had borrowed 500.00 from them to pay for the plumber to fix the front faucet it was also leaking bad and had to get a new fawcet put on cost 385.00 almost all of the money I borrowed from them. I Called them on payday and gave them my credit card..to pay off my 500.00 loan Then when I went online and saw I could now borrow my old 1800.00 I was going to go ahead and fix the back yard fawcett and fix my indoor bathtub fawcett. I am having problems with it too.I apllied and spoke with this girl and she said she would put it through.Then I got a call from cashnet usa about 10 minutes later and I answered it and they hung up..this was in the morning then about 530pm I get another call from a different girl telling me that now I have to send her my bank statements.Hmmmm thats odd after two years of loans from them and a loan I just did 2 weeks ago and paid back now I have to send them my personal bank account statements ..( and these people are working from home) No way I am not sending my bank statements to anyone.This just does not sound right all of a sudden now they need my bank statements.So I told Her I don't want to do the loan because I am not going to send ANYONE my bank statements they want to loan me the money and get the 300.00 or 400.00 back from loaning it to me that's fine ..But its not fine that all of a sudden they need my bank statements.So the next day I called to speak with a supervisor and of course not available and then this rep told me that I now need my front and back of my ID and I also Need my Bank statements too. I told her I want to know why now you need them after more than 2 years.(She couldn't give me an answer)I won't be using Cashnet USA anymore they won't be making several thousand dollars off me ANYMORE ( I have opted out my info to them on their end) and I have other Companies who will loan me money with my bank account info my social security number and my signature.I USED TO WORK FOR CITI BANK FOR 10 YEARS AND I AM NOT APLLYING FOR A HOME LOAN ( THEY DO NOT NEED YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION UNLESS THEY ARE PLANNING ON SELLING IT OR USING IT ) THIS IS A SMALL LOAN FOR 1800.00 NOT A 50,0000 OR HIGHER LOAN.ITS ALRIGHT ITS THEIR LOSS NOT MINE BECAUSE THERE IS ALOT OF OTHER LOAN COMPANIES THAT WILL BE HAPPY TO TAKE MY MONEY FOR BORROWING SHORT TERM FOR EMERGENCIES.DONT WASTE YOUR TIME UNLESS YOU LIKE GIVING ALL YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO A SMALL PAYDAY LOAN COMPANY WHICH I JUST WOULDN'T RECCOMEND TO DO. ESPECIALLY SINCE COVID AND PEOPLE OUT OF WORK AND PEOPLE DESPERATE FOR MONEY.NO WAY! I WOULD ONLY USE A COMPANY THAT NEEDS THE BASIC PROPER INFORMATION. ANYTHING MORE I WOULD BE VERY LEARY AND SUSPICIOUS..ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE GUARANTEED INCOME COMMING IN ON A REGULAR BASIS COVID OR NO COVID.AND OPT OUT OF COMPANIES IF YOUR NOT PLANNING TO USE THEM AGAIN..AND FYI  A SUPERVISOR NEVER CALLED ME BACK EITHER.THANK YOU CASHNET USA FOR SHOWING ME WHO & WHAT KIND OF COMPANY YOU REALLY ARE..",5,1
Grateful for the service,I have been a customer for a few months never had a issue until now I made payments but I‚Äôm being told I‚Äôm confused you can‚Äôt confuse math my availability should be more but going over the math 4 times with 4 different people including a manager they are still not caught all they way up mentally so I will never NEVER NEVER NEVER MESS WITH YOU AGAIN EVER your not sensitive to customers during this Rona and you think ur high credit line help no Go play in traffic all of you,5,1

I have been using Cashnetusa for years,"cash net is great for a payday loan only. if they offer you a line of credit do not i repeat DO NOT!!!! take it. They offered me a 2,000 credit line with the interest rate at 299% annually which i had no knowledge of until i called and asked.You will be paying back 4 times more than you borrowed. It is a set up and unfortunately i was suckered. They don't explain to you that the interest is accrued $10 daily regardless of your due date. ex: If your payments are 175.00 bi weekly only $75 will be applied to your principle $100 towards interest but by the time your next due date the $10 daily interest had accrued. It is will take me 18 months to pay off this TRAPPED loan.  These people are a rip off. i will look into filing a class action suit . i do not recommend applying for line of credit with CASH NET. Stick to a normal payday loan only if its an emergency.",5,1
My family was hit hard by the virus,I had a hard time with no work. Appreciate your team working with me until I got back out of the red.,5,1

They explain in easy to understand detail, make sure that you are satisfied, and always check to ensure that they have taken care of your needs. Your finances are always received when indicated, which is always by the next business day if requested by early evening. I have always had my payments automatically deducted and have never had an issue with the payment date being altered in any way. It's been the most enjoyable experience I have ever had with a company, thus the longevity. I have recommended this company to many and always get positive feedback and gratitude from those who have used CashNet. They are only a phone call or email away when needed and the request process could not be any easier. I intend to do business with them for a long time!",5,1

CashNetUSA,Very helpful abd understandinf when I needed to liwer my payments,5,1
The service was great and the staff was‚Ä¶,"Warning!!! Never Ever get a loan with these people no matter how much you think you need it. I promise you will totally REGRET it before you‚Äôre done paying it back. RATES are outrageous, payments RIDICULOUS, not knowing your upcoming payment amount UNHEARD OF until just before due date, understanding why you‚Äôre expected to make the upcoming due payment when you‚Äôre scheduled to make an arranged payment that was set up, but they‚Äôre still expecting a monthly payment as well, if I was able to make a regular payment there would be no need to make a payment arrangement in the first place. You may have paid the borrowed amount back but it doesn‚Äôt end there, trust their system, you will pay much more than you expected unless you just pay what they tell you is the balance in full at once. My advice to new APPLICANTS, DON‚ÄôT DO IT, DON‚ÄôT DO IT.",5,1
Great service,No problems on requesting or receiving money. Would appreciate if you could withdraw in 25 dollar increments instead of 50 being the minimum limit.,5,1

I made a $500 payment and only $200 went to my outstanding balance and the rep told me that the rest went toward interest. They don‚Äôt want you to pay this loan off. They want to take whatever money they can from you until you can‚Äôt stay afloat anymore and offer you to draw more credit. Don‚Äôt get a loan with this scam of a company.",5,1

Penny was excellent and very helpful.,I wish I could rate with no stars. These people are robbers. Dont ever borrow from cashnet you're better off without them. They continue to add daily interest which they say just started in April 2020. During a pandemic when people are out off work. Makes no sense! You make a payment to lower your balance and then the next day it increases again. Almost like something that never ends. They dont want you to pay off they'd rather keep you in debt. Very frustrating and inappropriate.,5,1
Answered my question about payments,I received a email to settle a loan with cash net usa or I will be taken to court. Ive never heard if this company and certainly never had a loan with them! So attention  SCAM ALERT!,5,1
Unlike my ex-husband...,Why do you have to pay to get a loan,5,1
Very happy with them and got me taken‚Ä¶,This company is such a racket do not use them. You can find better ways of accessing cash. They charged me over $450 to use $1700 for 17 days. I am reporting them to whatever agencies will listen to me. They are doing nothing but taking advantage of people who find themselves in a bad situation. Shame on them. After seeing the response? I just want to say that I have contacted your company and I was not satisfied with the response. I asked for a copy of the contract that I signed and I have not received it.,5,1
They are accommodating and polite each‚Ä¶,I am submitting another bad review because I still cannot access my account. This is complete and utter BS. I cannot see how much I still owe nor how much my monthly payment will be. I feel as if this is illegal.  I used to love this company but not anymore.,5,1

Very good quick cash loan,Thanks for a y‚Äôall help in my time of financial difficulties!,5,1
Very courteous and helpful.,"It was fast, but as I'm counting my monthly payments, I'm paying more then 100% intrest, which means you have to pay double of your loan amount and it's alot. I won't recoment this for anyone.",5,1

Very Helpful in this period of the‚Ä¶,"I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYBODY SAYS ABOUT CASH NET USA, I LOVE THEM AND THANK GOD FOR THEIR HELP WITH MY FINANCES!!!",5,1
Very courteous,"I use  to love this company. A little expensive but okay. That is until they switch my loan from a payday loan to a line of credit. The line of credit adds interest to your account everyday depending on how much you borrow. My loan adds between 40 and 50 dollars daily for a month. By the time my payment comes out only a couple of dollars goes toward my loan, the rest is interest. With my payday loan I always made 4 payments and it was paid off. Do not except lines of credit.  If they don't do payday loans in your state please consider another way to get the money you need.  They are worst than loan sharks. I wish I had read the terms first  but I just assumed it worked like the payday loans. Been with them for years. I called a said I couldn't make my payment of 347.00 dollars so they told me I could pay 128.00. When payment came due, they charged me the 128.00 plus the 347.00. How was that for help. If I could afford the 347.00 why would they think I could afford 2 payments at once. That was almost 500.00. My account paid it and I had an over draft fee.PLEASE RECONSIDER YOUR OPTIONS BEFORE DEALING WITH THESE PEOPLE.  If it's a payday loan that's fine but PLEASE DON'T DO A LINE OF CREDIT. IT SHOULD BE ILLEGAL FOR THEM TO DO THIS.",5,1
Very polite customer service,My experience was smooth and timely. Also far lower rates than the competitors. Very satisfied.,5,1
The young lady tried very hard to help‚Ä¶,Excellent company.  Quick and easy.  Ready to help when needed!,4,1
Good business,Didnt expect it to be so fast! Thank you cashner Usa!,5,1
Awesome,It was very quick and easy to get a withdrawal from my account. It only took a few steps,4,1
Excellent service,payments broke down keep you paying more over time than structured payments. Makes perfect sense to keep a person on the hook. If you don't need a 300% interest loan don't do it!! I dont have any questions for you. I understood the interest rate i understand repayment what i did not understand is fluctuations in payment that didn't even cover the principle and then one that did I'm sorry but steady payment of the same cost across the board is kinda a practice that needs to be adopted by screwing you out of a lower payment to not even cover the principle at all is kinda a poor way to extend a loan well past the payoff time. Food for thought.,5,1
good service,Always there when I need you! Quick and easy,5,1
Great company to borrow money from it's‚Ä¶,It was fast and easy. The best rates that I found!,5,1

GREAT HELP,Cashnet has been there when we it the most and fast,5,1
Thanks so much,Too high of interest rates even for established accounts in good standing .,4,1
Customer Service was wonderful,"I'll start with the positives first. . .The application process was super easy and the funds were deposited into my account the next business day!  Now for the real story. . . for the $1350 that I borrowed for an emergency, I have made $1300 in payments over the last 3 months and the balance is STILL $1377.  Needless to say, I will be making additional payments from now on with a goal to pay this thing off ASAP!!!  I would only recommend CashNetUSA as a LAST resort if you know that you will have a windfall of cash in the near future to pay them off because an APR of 299% means most of your payments are going to interest.  This type of predatory lending creates a cycle of debt that is very difficult to break.",5,1
Fabulous,"It was fast, safe and easy to request an advance.",5,1
quick and polite  to work with,Never had any problems in getting the loan and they are understanding. Thanks for your service.,5,1
Great company,This company refused me a loan after I had several loans with them and paid them off. Never late on payments. Nothing has changed on my stuff but they still declined me. What company does business like this. So it dont matter if you are a good customer any more.,5,1
I'm happy they were around when I‚Ä¶,You always be there.   Thankyou,4,1
She did really well,"CASHNET HAS BEEN THERE FOR ME MANY TIMES. THEY ARE QUICK, COURTEOUS, AND MOST OF ALL FAIR.  REAL CLASS ACT!THANK YOU CASHNET USA.",5,1
Make payment,This company  does not help. you pay back 10 times more than what you receive even if you try and pay extra it takes your extra payments and doesn't apply it to you account. Sorry but not sorry!!!! Then once you talk with customer services they have  very nasty attitudes.,5,1
Well i prefer other time thank you,HIGHWAY ROBBERS!!!! PLEASE DO NOT TAKE A LOAN OUT WITH THEM!!!,5,1
When I get my money I will write a‚Ä¶,Always friendly and good customer service.,5,1
They understand,"I DO NOT recommend using this loan company . This is a complete rip off . You pay way more back  than what you borrow . Its no point in even paying a minimum payment on the balance you borrow from , only 1/4 goes toward your balance . If you borrow from this scamming company you will be paying back your entire life . DONT make this mistake I made by borrowing from them , you will regret it .",5,1
impressed Customer,"Great service, it was right on time.",5,1

"Thanks for this opportunity,",Thank your company so much.  When I needed the help it was there.  In less than  36 hrs I had the money I needed to help me out.,5,1
Oscar went above and beyond,"No way this many people can be happy with this company. Fake reviews, please read the negative reviews as well. Before agreeing to the terms make sure you read the terms carefully. It‚Äôs a 299% interest rate folks. 299%!!",5,1
THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE. THEY TAKE YOUR MONEY AND OVER CHARGE AND THEY'RE NO HELP. NEVER TAKE OUT A LOAN WITH THESE CLOWNS.I THOUGHT THEY WERE A GOOD COMPANY. BUT NO HORRIBLE. I CANT SAY THIS ENOUGH HORRIBLE.,5,1
Called in to change a payment‚Ä¶,"I would not recommend  this business  ,to any trying to get a loan they prey on the most vulnerable  people.

URGEYOU",5,1
Great customer service,Love it awesome customer service ‚ù§Ô∏è,5,1
I sincerely recommend Cashnet,Your company is awesome to work with!  Thannk you!,5,1
Great loan option and will work with‚Ä¶,Outrageous interest rate and payment setup that makes no sense. Do not make your situation worse by borrowing money from this company. Most of not all of the 5 star reviews are fake. This business prays on the poor and keeps you in the hole and in debt to them. If you can pay off your loan with them and go to a credit union. This company is setup to keep you making payment that do little to your principle balance because the interest rate is sky high. It should be illegal what they do but I‚Äôm sure some lobbyist has paid off senators to keep them in business. I got $1400 and when I started paying it off they lowered it to $1100 and said it was due to Covid. So at a time of crisis you lower my line of credit. Ended up paying back over $3000 in just 6 months and that was because I paid it off early. Not worth it. Please listen to my review and steer clear.,5,1
Nice very very nice cool attitude,Fast. Got me out of a jam,5,1
Appreciation,They are taking more from you than they are actually helping you. They putting you in more debt than what you started with before borrowing. The interest is being charged every single day of the billing cycle which is a complete RIP OFF. They add extra to the interest and it make it impossible to pay them off. THEY ARE BASICALLY LEGAL ROBBERS.,4,1
Highly Recommend CashNetUSA,I been with CashNetUSA for 5 years and never had any problems with them. I would recommend CashNetUSA to anyone whoever needs help on a loan. I understand how in these hard times during the coronavirus but they lower your amount they lend you but I understand that and I agree with y‚Äôall on during it. But I will not stop being a customer to y‚Äôall because I believe in y‚Äôall. Y‚Äôall help me in hard times we I needed y‚Äôall. So thank y‚Äôall very much. And still like I say I will still be y‚Äôall best customer. Thank you Grace,5,1
This was not a complaint call,Thank egotism always helping me out when I need it!,5,1
Going to get my money because I don't‚Ä¶,Easiest and most convenient way to get a short term loan,3,1
Great service.,"Cashnetusa has really helped me work through some financially challenging times following an expensive divorce and other unforeseen large bills. I cant recommend Cashnetusa enough to anyone who is good at budgeting and needs some extra cash quickly, that wont impact them negatively when it's paid back.",5,1
Extremely helpful and courteous,"I have to say, that CashNetUSA has saved me so many times in my everyday life.  They are great!  If not for them and their FABULOUS payday loans, I would have faced late bills!  Thank You for your company!  Have nothing but good to say about them!",5,1
Absolutely life savers here,"They aren‚Äôt worth 1 star.  Horrible company.  Trust me, you don‚Äôt need money that bad.  What they charge for repaying the Absolutely undoable.  And they tell you that they will give you extra time on a payment‚Äînope, they tell you they cannot.  I cannot believe they are 4.5 stars.  I don‚Äôt know who they are getting to do their reviews.",5,1
Nothing bad,Absolutely the best company to deal with. I‚Äôve been a customer for over 5 years now and I have NEVER had any issues with CashNetUSA. I highly recommend their services if you ever need them!,5,1
I recommend cashnet USA to anyone,It's a great really fast gets straight to the point I only had minor issues with it,5,1
Good recommendations,"I have paid over $1400.00 in a months time on my loan. The information on Cashnet's portal is not kept current.They keep charging daily interest on the balance owed from the previous month. Trying to speak with any customer service they do not have the current information either. I have been told 3 different answers why my account was not current. It takes 2, 3, 4, business day's for Cashnet's system to clear a payment. In checking my account my last payment in the amount of $4270.00 has not posted as of 5/27/2020, payment was made on 5/15/2020. My account was behind due to the loss of work due to the corona viruse. payment arrangements were made. I caught my  account up on 5/8/2020. Their system did not see the account was current , so on 5/20/2020 their system took out a $99.00 payment. This after paying $1300.00 in a months time. For get about trying to get a hold of any live supervisor. and if you call in and you're over 50 you get connected to a solicitation for life alert not a live customer service rep. I will never use Cashnet nor would I recommend Cashnet. according to my accounting, and I run my own small business, cashnet owe's me because they have taken more than I owe,",4,1
Was taken care of quickly and‚Ä¶,I have had 3 different loans with CashNet. Very efficient and trustworthy!  They helped me out when in need!!!!!  Thank you!,5,1

Para emergencia son rasonables en‚Ä¶,They use to have loans up to $600 but not no more with no reason why.  I have used them for 2 years and never missed a payment.  Not Happy.,5,1
Great company to work with,"From day one , your staff has been professional, knowledgeable and extremely helpful. Having to borrow is never desirable, but Cashnet makes the process as pleasant as possible.  Thanks for your help üëç!!!",5,1
Helped me with my problem fast,It's never been this easy to get a loan. The money is usually in your account the same day if not the next day. I'll reccomend this company to family and friends.,5,1
I can‚Äôt say enough about CashNet USA,It was a easy to get get what I needed. Thanks,5,1
frank was very helpful and friendly,"Fast, reliable & Easy to apply. üëç",5,1
Great company and always willing to‚Ä¶,Got money easy and very quickly very happy customer as of now,5,1
My bank account has fraudulent activity‚Ä¶,Your associate answered all of my questions,5,1
I was very impressed for the‚Ä¶,"Please take heed to what I‚Äôm about to say! If you need money and have the means to pay it back in full within 2 weeks,  then by all means do it. But the reality is people who need money are not in a position to pay it back in full. This company preys on the low income people because they know they can‚Äôt pay it right back. This loan is meant for repayment within a few weeks to keep from getting those ridiculous customary fees. It should be against the law to charge the amount this company charges. My customary fees are over $10 per day plus $1.00 of interest per day. It‚Äôs outrageous! You can‚Äôt pay towards the original balance, it doesn‚Äôt work that way. If you pay more, it‚Äôs eaten up by the high customary fees. Just pay it in full and be done with them.",5,1
Fast loans.,"This company is horrible to borrow a loan from. What they don‚Äôt tell you is for $100 borrowed they add on $15. On top of that you gain interest every single day to the remaining balance. My loan was $850. After the additional $15 it was about $985. I have already paid $1075.15 back. But due to the amount increasing by 0.8192% every single day I still have to pay $742 back. That amount will increase every day until my next payment date I set up with automatic payments. DO NOT GET A LOAN FROM HERE. I make 2 payments every month and it‚Äôs never a flat amount, each time the amount I am paying is different from the time before. This company is a total scam. Do not fall for the reviews on their site. I‚Äôve asked a customer service rep for help explaining this process and they did everything to try and avoid my questions by repeating the same thing over and over and then had the audacity to ask if I could pay the remaining balance today. If I could why the heck would I have taken out a loan?!",5,1
Had too many loans out.,"Beware! This company doesn't deserve one star! Apparently my account has been under review and when it's ""under review"" you cannot access it but in the meantime they continue to charge me interest fees and late fees. Their  customer service has the worst attitudes. Please do not do business with this company.  Shady is an understatement!",5,1
I have been a customer of CashNetUSA For Years,High interest loans. You pay so much more back. So make extra payments. I will NEVER take a loan out with cashnetusa again. Two representatives gave me misinformation leading to a surprise charge when this whole time I thought the loan was paid in full. Customer support and their representatives are useless.,5,1
Awesome Service...üòÄ,"This is the most horrible thing I have ever done in regards to receiving a loan. I know now I am a sucker and did not read my contract carefully. Companies like this should be SHUT DOWN!  They take advantage of people in need. This is my story- I borrowed 2000 and realize now I will pay back over 3500. Of course, it will be less if I can pay back more each month. I can't do this so therefore, I will pay over 3500.The interest rate is outrageous. Read carefully and Please do not use this company or any other one like it!! You will regret it! I hope this helps anyone thinking about using this company!!",5,1
Excellent Service,"They have  ALWAYS had exceptional customer service each and everytime  I have reached out especially when I had concerns of being able to make the full payment on time.  I went with them when I was in a bind. Did I pay way more than I should have to get the money I soo terribly needed more than once? Absolutely but they definitely do not blindside you about that.  So for everyone whining about how much you had to pay, pay closer attention next time to every detail.  People concerned about getting an interest rate decrease because of Covid? Did your house note or car note drop your interest rate? No, so why do you expect any difference? I am thankful to be paying mine off,  however if I needed this service again,  Cashnetusa would be one of top choices.  Thank you for terrific customer service esp during some scary times!",5,1

Very nice gentleman answered all my‚Ä¶,I've had nothing but really great service from cashnetusa,4,1
CashUSA is the way to go..!,"I would not recommend Cashnet., only because with the interest rate of 299% they have been paid over the value of my orginal credit line. Right now I'm paying over 200 dollars and they charge 168 dollars interest for the month. I have had my credit line over a year. They have always been professional and while I needed the money this type of credit line in the end becomes a greater debt than the orginal reason for my request. I would highly recommend a traditional loan and if you can't get one borrow from family and pay them back. Exhaust all your possibilities before considering a credit line even if you have bad credit. If it weren't for the ridiculous 299% interest rate they would other wise be fine. In addition in light of COVID 19 you'd think the company with all the money they have made would bring the interest down to a traditional one to help their customers instead they reduce the credit line line which isn't horrible but the monthly cost still...is outrageous. Please look at your options before coming to this company. The people who own this company are not generous, this is purely business and they are not a life line to your financial problems.,this is business and you need to seriously consider that when looking for money for a short term problem.",5,1
My experience with  cash net USA was‚Ä¶,"I am a disabled veteran and am pretty sure my government check is too little to do business with this company. the commercial tells everyone het don't do credit scores, but I risked my life for USA it would be nice for some respect. Thet told me on tnhe phone for privacy sake they cannot tell me what I need to do to do business with them.t",5,1
Patty,I have used them recently since the COVID-19 and they were very friendly and if I was late with the payment there as no extra charge. I am trying to get another again as times have got hard but not sure if I was approved it. I will update if I was or date. As I know it is rough right now and the little extra can go a long way even for just food. As long as it was approved again this time even after 2 week late payment then Excellent it is!!!,5,1
Very easy to apply and my money the‚Ä¶,"I actually called into CashNetUSA to report a suspicious call that I received and since I had actually applied for a loan not all that long ago I figured eh why not ask about it.And I had been approved for a $500 Line Of Credit!

I asked to receive $250 to my bank account and in a matter of hours, it was in my account all on the same day.Thank you CashNetUSA",5,1
Very helpful in a time of need.,"I was in a tough situation and borrowed money from this lender in Jan 2020! I wish I never had! Their interest rates are horrible!

Good people!,"NEVER USE THIS COMPANY Their interest and fees for borrowing money are outrageous. I am a mentally disabled person and truly didn't understand what I was getting into. I tried seeking help from this company to get help paying them off with a social security check coming in monthly and they would offer no help at all, just saying that I signed the contract to deal with it.  I would NEVER suggest anyone to borrow from this company unless you're rich enough to pay them off before the due date and pay their fee and interest for the amount you borrow in full the first month. Otherwise you get yourself into a vicious cycle where the is no light at the end of the tunnel. Again, DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.",5,1
Costumer service was excellent!,"Smooth,  quick and easy get done",5,1
When I needed help they were always‚Ä¶,"Very helpful, enjoy their service thanks for helping when in need.",5,1

Easy Money,"I used their services many times. Since the Covid-19 started I somehow was only approved for a smaller amount.  Which makes no sense because my bank status, credit, and income never changed.     I'm blessed to be able to work from home.  They have no explanation about why for the first time my approved amount is much less.  I found a new cash advance company to work with instead.",5,1
Cash Net Usa,It paid my bills for a month time Thank you,5,1
I love this site,"The customer service person I spoke with was very helpful in helping me understand all the fees and what exactly I had to do to request money.  He was so nice and very knowledgeable of the company and answered all my questions without hesitation.  The only thing I did not like was the percentage rate.  However, when your credit score is not the best and you need help to cover household expenses while your husband is laid off from work due to COVID19, they were there to help me and I appreciate that!!",5,1
Great customer service,"Very unprofessional. I overpaid the balance showing on thier website by more than $100. After showing my payments my new balance was over $200. How does $822 minus $1016 equal $216? I called to get some answers. The first rep had no idea what she was doing but was nice and clearly put into a position without proper training. After not being able to answer that math question she said her supervisor would call me. Before I go on note that interest is charged daily. The next day (there was around 6 hours left in the curent day) around 10:00 AM I get a call from Alana the manager while I was with a client of my own. I asked if I could call her back. Maybe 30 min later I call. I am told she would call me right then. She didn't return my call that day. I called again asking why no call. I'm told she would call me in ""less than an hour"". Still no call. Today she calls. Understand that I don't really care for my given first name and have gone by my middle name for about 45 years. After I point out this fact Alana, or as I shall refer to as Lucy, calls me by first name every time she speaks and tells me that she has to. That's just the rudest thing I have ever heard of. Back to the point. Lucy tells me that I should have taken a screenshot of the web page showing the $822 balance and since I didn't have that she wouldn't do anything. So I am left with having to pay over $200 more plus $5 of interest charged while waiting for Lucy to do nothing. I knew going in that this was a high cost loan but it was a 90 day turnaround that I was ok with. I had no idea that I was going to get gouged and treated like crap.Don't use CashnetUSA!ALLEN",5,1
Excellent customer service.,"I was able to easily get a loan from Cashnet. And the process to receiving the funds is easy. I realize that this is a company that helps those in need with not the best credit score. And if you need a small amount, and can pay it back quickly, it's ok. But, dont be fooled by the bi weekly payments.  Very little of this money is used towards your principal. DO NOT MAX OUT YOUR LOAN!! My issue with this company is the lack of training they provide to their employees.  No one can explain why your balance is what it is, which leads me to believe that Cashnet currently has some possible fraudulent activity going on. CASHNET IS NOT BBB ACCREDITED. When Covid-19 hit, Cashnet immediately decreased everyone's actual approval amount. This company does not care about being there in your time of need, nor do they care about their customers. SHAME ON THE CEO, AL GOLDSTEIN, AND HIS SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM! Fortunately,  I  was able to pay my loan off quickly, and did not suffer as most have from their dealings with this company. Times are hard, especially right now. But you'd be better off getting a payday loan, at least you know what you're paying.",5,1
I really appreciate your company for‚Ä¶,Never will I get another loan from these people . Customer service sucks and my dollar amount goes up like 4$ a day that the loads not completely paid up . It‚Äôs ridiculous they could care less about people,5,1
HAD SOME QUESTIONS ON HOW YOUR LOANS‚Ä¶,My experience was great I should have call CashNetUSA a long time ago. Thanks I look forward to many years of doing business with CashNetUSA,5,1
Very best payday loan company,"This is a Trash company They are a fraudulent company, and I took a line of credit $1500  and had to pay $3000 in less than 20 days. they keep increasing interest in 8 hours never and never tell you about there policy, I almost paid them double.  they charge you $220 fee for the first time when you open an account with this trash company warns.  find another place to get a loan. cashnetis fraudulent and exists only they keep you in debt. I don't want any reply from this trash company . all there 5 start rating is fake",5,1
Excellent Customer Service!,"These 5 star reviews are FAKE. They are fraudulent and the truest definition of loan sharks. With a 325% interest rate, you'll never ever pay your debt to them. You can make a payment towards your balance and they apply it to the ridiculous interest even if you want to put it towards the principal. Poor people in a bind look towards these kinds of companies for quick money but it is NOT worth dealing with. You'll be in an endless circle of debt that you'll never get out of. I paid $400 towards my line of credit and my balance went UP. At that point, im the fool for even signing the contract. This is a warning. FIND ANOTHER PLACE TO GET A LOAN. CASHNET IS FRAUDULENT AND EXISTS ONLY TO KEEP YOU IN DEBT. I DO NOT WANT A REPLY FROM THIS TRASH COMPANY EITHER. I DO NOT CARE WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY. MY ACCOUNT IS CLOSED FOR GOOD.",5,1
CashNetUSA has gone above and beyond to‚Ä¶,"This place is very crooked.  Don‚Äôt borrow money from them. You will regret it. If I could have given them negative stars, I would have.",5,1
Customer service rep,"It did ok in a pinch but dealing with them is a major pain. Website is glitchy and unreliable, customer service reps are unhelpful, uncommunicative, secretive and cagey. They make it impossible to process basic updates on your account. Trying to get receipts or documents takes forever and getting honest answers takes even longer.Nah, not going to contact your ‚Äúdedicated customer service line‚Äù and be put through your nonsense again. The only thing you‚Äôre ‚Äúdedicated‚Äù to is BS.",5,1
She made my day,"I don't understand, how do people give Cashnetusa 5star rating when they screw you so hard? I would recommend new customer, please don't use their service. I took line of credit $800 and had to pay $1500 in less than 20 days. They keep increasing interest in 8hours. I should've taken other company's line of credit.",5,1
As they are high interest,The person that gave me help is wonderful.,5,1
So helpful amd kind when we needed it‚Ä¶,My experience was fantastic with Cashnet. Fast and easy approval and funding.,5,1
I love this company,"This is a crooked place to take a loan from. I would advise you not to, but I had no options. It doesn't matter how much you pay down as you still pay the interest rate based on taking out the complete loan. Mine was a $1,000$ loan. Every day it added 8-10$ to the principle. I paid down 200$ towards it and same amount each day. I paid another hundred towards it a day later and same amount put back on the card each day. It's down to 776$ this past Sunday and I look at it now and it's back up to 826$. That's a crooked rate but they can do that because of how POS the place is. I put down 300$ more towards it but will just pay the thing off with my next check and never come back to them. There are laws in place that protect consumers from BD interest rates like this but I guess that doesn't apply to this type of company. It's the reason why they don't report to credit agencies. It's very shady and if I were you I'd sell something or put something you own up for collateral at a bank. This is the old mafia way of doing business. That's my honest review. I had no where to go and they helped me out so without options they take advantage of you. Such is life, right?",5,1
Agent was outstanding,Cashnetusa is awesome the whole process is super fast. From step one to the money being deposited was very fast. Thank you cashnetUSA,4,1
Excellent,Fast and efficient service. The funds were actually in my account before I received formal notice of approval via email!,5,1
They helped me very fast and‚Ä¶,"Worst ever I ask for help my hours got short couldn‚Äôt make a payment they asked me if I could make it the following day or I ask someone to borrow money to pay no help no nothing never miss a payment ,1500 loan still paying since 12-12-2019",5,1

Received a call from cash net today and‚Ä¶,I didn't even get to put in an amount before being denied nothing.

Reliable & Fast,"F these people. Applied a got denied and said my credit was too low when I know it‚Äôs not then I check and it says it pulled it from some unknown credit agency and said my credit score was 300 points lower than my fico and other scores. My wife is with them however and paid her loan today and went to reloan because we NEED the 255 because times are hard with this PANDEMIC but what do they do, they lower everyone‚Äôs limit to 100 because of the pendemic when other companies are extending dates and waiving fees this pos company lowers and screws people over, this says a lot about this company and I would advise never to go to this place WAAAAY better options out their that don‚Äôt ruin your credit.",5,1

I have used CashNetUSA on many‚Ä¶,"Do not get a line of credit (loan) with CashnetUSA, unless you can pay back the entire amount within the next 30 days. It's a rip off geared toward the poor.

CashNetUSA Is Helpful,Very bad. Minimum payment high and always increasing biweekly.,5,1
Good service,"DO NOT USE CASHNET!! As a return customer, with an account paid off EARLY and in good standing, not 1 but 2 representatives lied to me about when and how I paid off my account, and when I could receive funds! They took my last $80 and have left my family with no money, no food, etc for 4 days during the Coronavirus outbreak. I have learned my lesson! So disappointed with this company! Please don't be as foolish as me. I just had nowhere else to turn!",5,1
Good service and understanding of‚Ä¶,"I would NOT recommend CashNetUSA to anyone. They tell you they dont go off your credit report.

I have a checking account with bank of America and an email address wich is the only things they say you need to get a loan and I was turned down for any amount of a loan including $250. My credit score is 550. The only reason they would turn me down is because of my low credit score that they say they dont go off. Stay away from cashnetusa unless you have a great credit score and you just want to pay an ungodly high APR. They also told me they would call my employer to verify I worked there and in that process would let them know that I applied for a loan. That shouldn't be any of my employer's business.  Stick with traditional loans.",5,1
I am just waiting to see if I get‚Ä¶,"Yep, there we go - now I got my own cookie-cutter response.  Dear CashNet:  You suck.  I have used Loanatlast and they are MUCH more straightforward than you.  There are tons of better alternatives than you out there.",4,1
"Excellent,helpful and understanding.","This company has really lost its mind!  They may have been great once, but they aren't anymore.  Exceptionally poor record keeping, customer service is there, but they can't answer any questions so they are next too useless.  My wife and I were using them for short term, and out of the blue without any cause, they actually reduced our credit availability without any previous notification.  We hadn't missed a payment or anything, they just did it!  Absolutely nuts!!If you can find other means to finance your needs other than CashNetUSA, I would highly recommend avoiding this firm, as a company you can rely on to be there when you need them, CashNetUSA is not that firm!!",5,1
Excellent service from Sean,"Hated Them when I first started, How could you do this, You want me to pay how much back!!! Being my first time ever taking out a loan, I was in total disbelief!

Cashnet was very helpful with my‚Ä¶,I was extremely disappointed to find that my line of credit was reduced after being with cashnet so long.

My payments are between $160-170 every two weeks and out of that only $49 goes toward my actual loan and the rest goes to interest. These People are a total RIP off and on top of that they had the nerve to decrease my credit limit. This is the sorriest company that I have ever dealt with and Will NEVER deal with the Money Hungry Company Again.Nor Will I Recommend this Poor Company to anyone.. THIS COMPANY IS PATHETIC",5,1
Highly recommend!!!,many people is out of work because of the coronavirus and many bank  and credit card company is stopping all interest rate and allowing their customer to miss 2-3 payment with no penalty.NOT CASHNETUSA OR CASHFROMUS.I CALL AND ASK FOR HELP BECAUSE I GOT LAID OFF. ALL THEY SAID WAS WE WILL GIVE YOU 2 MONTH BUT THE HIGH INTEREST WILL CONTINUE AND YOUR BALANCE WILL GO UP. WHAT A SAD COMPANY.

CashNetUSA is good but could be great.,"LISTEN TO THE BAD REVIEWS!!! This company is highly NOT recommended. Every time I called, the representatives gave the wrong information. I called in to make an early payment AND made a larger payment and this company still drafted the payment due for that week. The interest charges change by the day. I borrowed $800 in November and here we are in March, and I paid $900.00 yesterday to repay the full loan. If the loan isn't paid off in full, you WILL continue to owe CashNet USA for a long time. It got so bad, I wanted to get a loan from my bank to pay CashNet off. This company is not my first, second or even my tenth choice for loans. The money comes faster because the repayments take longer to repay. Don't do it!!!",3,1
I received an email for a past due‚Ä¶,It was easy and fast to borrow money from cash net. However the interest rate and payment is extremely high. On a $1500.00 loan the payments were over $550 a month in which $386.00 went solely towards interest. I made a loan with another company just to pay Cashnet off. Within 4 months I had paid over $1300.00 in interest. Not worth it.,4,1
The questions I asked were answered and‚Ä¶,"Was approved for a loan at 6:35 am CT 3/9/20. According to their own service representatives and their website, this loan should have been transferred to my bank by the end of the day. By late that night my ACH transfer was not even showing up as pending in my account. I talked to a representative at 9:31 pm CT of that same night, and they could see nothing wrong with my ACH transfer, and was told to call back in the morning, since they have until 11:59 pm to post. It is now 7:45 am CT 3/10/20 and the funds are still not even pending in my account. I gave them a call back trying to figure out what is going on; and apparently their system is so f*cked that it took the bank account information I had input CORRECTLY, and changed it to the last for digits of my account (which wasn't even entered, as their system doesn't allow the ""-"" key to be entered. My account number looks lik XXXXXXXXX-0001 or -0002.. the last 4 digits are to distinguish savings and checking).So now, not only are the funds not sent to my account, I have to wait until 3/11/20 for them to receive the money back, and only then can I attempt to fix their mistake and attempt to get the loan I needed on the 9th.Don't bother with this company, their website is set up poorly ( the timezone of the site doesn't match the timezone they are actually in and use... their system auto corrects banking information to the point it won't actually transfer), and they can't even help you when their system makes a mistake.By the time this would get sorted out, I will have gotten my actual paycheck, and already have to pay late fees, so this service offered me nothing but a waste of my time and energy.Now I'm sure since this is a 1 star review they're going to copy and paste an auto response to this comment. They cannot help you.",5,1

I have gone through multiple weeks with issues with the discount codes, got down to my final day to file an extension because of their system issues, was provided a confirmation that my extension was approved, then the day after my final day to file an extension they supposedly send an email that I never received (probably their system issues) that said my extension couldn't be processed allegedly then continued to charge my account the entire amount that was owed on my loan. I have done multiple transactions with them but the last two experiences with them have been horrible. I will not be coming back as a customer and I recommend you don't either!",5,1

They took first payment when agreed but only a week later on the 6th took out another full payment instead of the 13th when I had agreed to the second payment of the plan. I called and the rep was unsympathetic just saying that was the regular payment from the plan I had initially agreed to. I informed him that by taking that money a week early, Cashnetusa may have prevented my ability to pay the loan back completely by taking all I had in my account for the next week. No sympathy and wasn‚Äôt willing to push the payment off for next week now. NEVER trust these people with your loan, go ANYWHERE else!!!",5,1
The best fir short term in a spot loan‚Ä¶,Fast and easy.  Thank you so much.,5,1
Great service saves my a$$ alot,"Got a pre-approval offer, called and got approved for $1000 flex loan, signed contract, gave bank info, said would have the $500 that I was needing by 3/5/2020. Was checking on app and said I got denied after approval and sending copy of DL and Social, called customer service said sorry for confusion but it was denied and they have a signed contract from me and my account information. DO NOT FALL FOR THE OFFERS, I will have to contact a lawyer because I did sign a contract and have not received money from them and they have access to my banking, who‚Äôs to say they won‚Äôt try to collect payments",5,1
Everything was smooth and quickly,Legitimate lender. Calvin was helpful and very knowledgeable. Awesome service. Fast direct deposit. I would use their service again.W.S.,5,1
Kesha from cash net made it easy to‚Ä¶,Less than 24 hours ago I was Google searching this company and decided to go for it. I am blown away by how painless and seemless the application process was. I woke up with funds in my account that I needed to pay off some unexpected bills. Incredibly grateful. The app I downloaded to keep track of my balance due is so simplistic. Love it!!  I'll update as I continue this journey with CashNerUSA.,5,1

Was able to address my concerns quite‚Ä¶,They were great Nd answered all my questions,5,1
Really good and easy very kind !,"Updated my review : gave it 2 more stars because I got a nice customer service rep to verify that whoever did my other application, did not enter my bank account info right and therefore she had to cancel , redo , and actually took the time to verify she had put the correct bank info before submitting application,and it got approved and I had funds next day. I give the nice customer service rep lady 5stars for going all out to verify info ,but 3 stars for the other lady entering info wrong (could‚Äôve been prevented if she had repeated the bank info she put in system before submitting application .. not saying you have to be perfect butCome on ).",5,1
Very much appreciated,"OK HERE WE GO AND WE'RE OFF AND FIRST OF ALL I HAVE LITERALLY BEEN TURNED DOWN WITH A FOR THE PAST 3 FULL YEARS OF TRYING AND CREDIT RANGING FROM 500 TO AN ALMOST 720 JUST TO KEEP HEARING THE SAME THING AND I DO PROMISE THAT THIS MAN WILL NEVER EVER APPLY AGAIN AND ITS SO SAD THAT A GOOD HARD WORKING MAN THESE DAYS CANT GET AHEAD DUE TO LOAN COMPANY'S LIKE ""CASH NET USA"" AND WITH THAT BEING SAID I WILL NOT REFER ANYONE AND IF YOUR LOOKING TO GET JUST A VERY AND I MEAN A VERY SMALL LOAN JUST TO HELP BUMP YOUR CREDIT AS I TRIED AND GOT TOTALLY TURNED DOWN FOR A SIMPLE $300 AND THATS IT BUT STAY AWAY FROM ""CASH NET USA""",5,1

I ask to speak to the manager and was told that the manager will call me back in the next 24 hours.",5,1
I was not happy prior to customer Rep‚Ä¶,Great service.  From start of application to money in my bank ... Completed in less than 4 hours.,4,1
Ssmcgee84@outlook,"It's quick and easy for a reason. Stay away from the line of credit. 1500 dollars is made available, but the catch, which I feel isn't emphasized enough, is that it is at 30% ... a month. You pay back 500 in a monthly payment only to have about 90 go towards your actual principle. You'll end up paying 4k - 5k total in about 10 months, if you don't borrow against it again, for a 1500 dollar loan. The 300 payday loan is alright-ish, but stay away from the line of credit. I think they should show your monthly payments per month for the length of the loan before you approve of it. If you can pay it off quickly, like within a month or 2, it might not hit so hard.",5,1
Professional indeed,I didn't  get  any  runaround  it was  quick  and on point,5,1

I called in to update my bank‚Ä¶,Everything went good with recieving my loan & very informative on my pay schedule & the process for approval was done in a timely manner & I would most definitely return to CashNetUSA if I needed another loan. I would recommend this loan company to my fellow peers if they need a loan!! I was very pleased!,5,1

Great company,I‚Äôve been using  cashnetusa since 2005. Never ever had a problem . Many Banks turned me away however cashnetusa has always and I mean aways approved my loans. I keep up with my payments and never default . Customer Service is excellent. Just one little suggestion. Please offer promo codes every now and then for customer loyalty .,5,1
Candice took care of questions I had‚Ä¶,"I have worked for a week with CashNetUSA loans and have yet to receive  anything but the runaround. My bank statement would not upload to their website, so I cut and pasted the important parts-to be rejected for about the 4th time. I screen shot the pages and sent that-rejected again-name not present. Really-get a website that allows easier applications. I am not a happy camper. All for a small loan of $650. The terms were good.  The interest was good.  The customer service people were polite and helpful. The end results  are not so wonderful. Maybe tomorrow will be a better day .",5,1
Very kind,just don‚Äôt get a loan with them even if you pay before your due date they will still take out your money from your bank account they made me over draft and they didn‚Äôt pay my overdraft fee just go with a Bank they will honor your payment not like cashnetusa so i payed my loan off in less the 2 months never again if i need a small loan i will look for a local bank,5,1
My call went great and the lady‚Ä¶,They were great.   Was easy to do.,5,1

We borrowed $1500 for help with Christmas gifts and two months later, after paying back nearly $1800 (made extra payments) we still owe over $900.

I just want to say thank you üòä,"***UPDATE OF MY UPDATE*** SEEMINGLY AFTER CASHNETUSA REREAD MY LATEST REVIEW, THEY'RE ISSUING A ""PENALTY"" FOR MY UPDATED REVIEW!!! I'M NOW ONLY ELIGIBLE FOR $100!!!! HAHAHA!!! WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITH $100!?! THAT'S WHAT I TIP THE GUY WHO DETAILS MY MERCEDES!!! KEEP READING!***UPDATED REVIEW*** This 1st paragraph is updated 8/5/2020, but continue to read, because chances are my first review will apply to you personally. I'm just updating, that I have sold one of my houses (I have 2 more) and in the middle of selling one of my small businesses (I have 1 more), and have made more money during this SCAMdemic than EVER before. If this BUSINESS sale goes thru, said and done, I would've made nearly or just over $600,000 this year, ALONE. That being said, I've paid down ALL of my debt, and I'm sitting at 14% total utilization with $26,000 total overall revolving credit. After waiting for nearly 2 MONTHS, my credit score, RIGHT NOW, IS 790, again with flawless payment history on EVERYTHING. I paid off over $17k in debt. My Fico is around 740. I'M STILL NOT QUALIFIED. Now, Obviously I DON'T NEED A LOAN, I JUST WANTED TO SEE IF THIS COMPANY STANDS BEHIND WHAT THEY CLAIM. AT THIS EXACT TIME, WITH MY CREDIT SCORES IN THE TOP 18% OF THE ENTIRE COUNTRY, I ONLY QUALIFY FOR $255 HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!! I wish a quarter star was an option!! Original review starts below so please read for the ones who don't have the credit that I have. Don't get dinged if you don't absolutely have to. Ok. I believe I've written a 5 star review before, because they've been such an outstanding lender over the past couple years, so let me explain why I am now giving therm just one star.First, I have a PERFECT credit history. Fico of about 660 or so.19 years of 100% on time payments. I carry about $10k in debt, but perfect, PERFECT on time payment history, and only 1 account in collections (the police department in So. Cal actually stole one of my show cars (swear on everything I know and love!!!!) and stuck me with an impound fee, and auctioned it off when they knew i was out of town for 5 weeks, TRUE STORY) and it will stay there until it falls off my credit report in 2 more years. Other than that, perfect.I have applied and successfully obtained 2 loans from cashnetusa. The first was for $2600. Got the loan in March of 2018. I MADE EVERY SINGLE PAYMENT ON TIME, AND HAD THE LOAN COMPLETELY PAID OFF BY THAT FOLLOWING JULY. Yes, within 4 months. Everything was hunky dory.Constantly bombarded by emails begging me to re-loan, because of attorney fees, I decided to reapply, and received ANOTHER $2600 loan last February of 2019, I believe. Again, I MADE EVERY SINGLE PAYMENT ON TIME, AND HAD THE LOAN COMPLETELY PAID OFF BY THAT FOLLOWING OCTOBER, as in 4 months ago (2019). NEVER LATE, NEVER MISSING A SINGLE PAYMENT. Again, I receive numerous daily emails asking me to re-loan, now for up to $3300 and special 'benefits'.Today, I open an email from Cashnetusa, and go to apply. I was told by ""upswing"", which is part of Cashnetusa, that I qualify for a 6% lower APR, and a ""delay-a-pay"" feature, because of my perfect track record. I logon, and to my surprise, I'm only qualified for $255. I navigate the website, log out, and log back in. Still, only $255. So I just called them and asked them what happened to my Upswing Loan amount of $3300. The lady sees my account history, and agrees with me and says ""That IS strange. I don't know. Let me put you on hold and ask my manager whats going on. You're not the first person to call about this issue."" SUPER nice lady BTW...so I agree. She comes back and says ""My manager said that its computer generated and you're only eligible for $255, but maybe in the future, you'll qualify for an Upswing loan."" I said ""What!?! YOU guys send me the emails and offers!!! So, you're telling me, you offer me 'benefits' and 'perks', that aren't eligible for the 'payday loan', and despite my perfect payment history with you guys, and everyone else in my financial web, you won't allow me to loan, or honor your email solicitations? I would think that you guys would WANT customers proven to repay their debts!!! WTH!!"" and all she can say is exactly what she had said a couple minutes prior. ""It's system generated and you'll just have to wait to see if you qualify and get invited again."" Well, how can I NOT!?!? Do you guys actually want people that have no intention of paying you back? How do you make money!?!So, what once was a prosperous, generous, and what I personally considered to be the BEST small amount lender just took a HUGE L. I will no way, ever, reapply to them after what they've just done to a LOYAL, PERFECT, 100% ON TIME PAYING AND PAYING OFF CUSTOMER, EVEN IF $3300 WILL BREAK ME. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED, AND THEY LOST A TRUE CUSTOMER OVER THIS BS.",5,1

Most of the time when I was struggling out of highschool. now that im using them less because my finances are better. They no longer allow me to make payments on my loan because of the infrequency of using them. Although i've never missed a payment in that 10 years and my CS is 200pts higher than it was when i started using them. They've cut my available services. I will not be using them again. I would recommend people to avoid it if possible.,5,1

They do not have any interest in actually helping someone stuck in an financial bind instead they take ADVANTAGE of you. Those interest rates are absolutely ABSURD. You end of paying back 3 to 4 more than you actually borrowed . Luckily I have bad my debt to them but I definitely will NOT be doing business with them again . Highly NOT recommended!",5,1
Very easy to deal with thank you!,Very friendly to talk to and very helpful to thank you,5,1
Excellent,Very fast and easy.  Needed money fast for legal costs and had it the next day in my checking account.  The interest rate is through the roof but when you need cash fast for an emergency they are there for you.,5,1

A day after I received my money, I started getting messages that my loan was due soon.

How can you not appreciate this short‚Ä¶,Very fast and efficient. My only complaint is on the date it‚Äôs to be paid pack the money is always taken out of my account immediately.  So I don‚Äôt understand why my payment processes with this company for 5 days? It‚Äôs a automatic withdrawal so they immediately have the money.  I guess it doesn‚Äôt make sense to me.,5,1
I'm very happy with CashNetUsa,"Jeffrey Morgan (Loan Advisor) kept saying that due to some debt, they needed money sent to this company in order for me to be approved with a loan. DON‚ÄôT EVER BORROW FROM THESE PEOPLE!!! They legit made me spend about $2-$3k within 3-4 months just because of some other random  debt that shouldn‚Äôt have concerned them. Jeffrey would ask to put money into a Walmart card and then give him the info to receive the money. In return, you‚Äôd expect to receive the loan you applied for but it‚Äôs all a big SCAM!",5,1

Good company to do business with.,"I'm a senior of 71. I get $800 a month to live on SSI and SSA. I could never survive without Cashnet Payday Advances. I'm never ahead but I'm never behind with CashNet. Everything is so easy online, it's like online shopping sites, order it, get it, and never have to wait in line to leave. In this world instant gratification is hard to find anywhere.",5,1
Great customer service,"This is the worst loan company out there. There interest rates are crazy high....they charge you a daily interest charge..and if you need an extension, they will give you an extension but they charged me 63.44$ to get a 10 day extension and then charged me another 63.44 interest on top of the original loan which was only 250$...In the end I will have paid Cash Net USA 126.88$ to loan me 250$...which is almost like loan shark fees...it is completely ridiculous..Lend Up is a much better payday loan company. I got the money fast but it was not at all worth it.  Do not borrow from Cash Net USA unless you like giving away your hard earned money. I will pay them off but I will neverrrrrrrrr everrrrrrrr get another loan thru them. If you cannot pay your loan back immediately it just is not worth borrowing from this company.",5,1

This coming from someone who has gotten loans from numerous reputable companies, in dire times, and paid them all back with no outstanding balance. These people are vultures, in the worst way. We all need a little immediate help from time to time, that's the result of the economy we live in. Though I'm very serious when I say, I'd have to be literally starving with no other option, than to take another loan through this company. There's plenty of loan companies out there with a compassionate, helpful, competent staff available to you. Seek them out and pass this up. It's some of the best advice on this matter I could give anyone.",5,1

Of all the Lenders I have dealt with by‚Ä¶,If I could it would be no star. This company is horrible.

I got a call this week saying my income was going to be garnished called to find out why only to hear it was this company saying I stole from them and now I have to pay them $1000 or my wages get garnished. Now last I checked my mustang was worth way more then what the loan was for and on top of that the lady was completely rude and didn‚Äôt want to set up a payment arrangement so I could get this over and done with. Stay away from this company!!! I can not say this enough!!!! A 300% interest rate is ridiculous! They will not work with u at all they just want your money!!!!,5,1

She was very considerate in answer all‚Ä¶,"You hear a lot of bad things about payday loan companies but CashNet is pretty legit.  I get the small loans, up to $255, I don't go overboard with taking too much.  But their installment loans have ridiculous fees; you're basically paying a fee to them equal to the loan amount, which i think the installment loans start at like $1,000.  It's highway robbery.  I did the installment loan once and it was very hard to pay off.  I do not recommend the installment loans but I do recommend the small loans.  I also have to mention their stellar customer service, you wouldn't expect it from a payday loan company but every time I talk to a customer service representative, they are always kind and professional.  CashNet will always have my business!",5,1

Super easy super fast and easy approval,"I have used CashNetUSA on and off for a couple of years now and have always had a great experience. Transactions smooth and always paid back on time. However this most recent time the loan was repaid as usual through my bank on autopay on time and Cashnet's website shows it was paid on time on 1/17/20, however 6 days later Veritec is still showing the loan outstanding. A call to Cashnet referred me to Veritec. A call to Veritec referred me back to Cashnet. Another call to Cashnet and I was told there was nothing that could be done. Needless to say I'm a little disappointed and still unsure of what to do.Response to reply from CashNet -7:00pm ETI did call and was told that they cannot view why Veritec denied it. I explained that I understood that and that was why I was told to call Veritec and Veritec said they can‚Äôt view CashNet only that my account was still being reported open.

Always helpful,"I applied for a loan and was approved for $1450.  I selected that I only wanted to borrow $500.  When I went through the process I was approved.  Wanting to know what my payments would be, I contacted customer service.  They said it would be $148 every two weeks!  When I asked how this could be for a $500 loan request I was told they base their payments on the amount of credit youre approved for, not what you actually borrow!  What a misleading and dishonest practice.  How can you set payments based upon an approval amount and not what was actually borrowed???  Needless to say I cancelled before the money was put in my account.  Do not use them!  They are scammers!",5,1

Thanks again,"I have taken out several loans with my payday being Thursday and the payment date being the next day on Friday.Now all of a sudden they need to take the money out on Thursday the actual payday. The problem is that CashNetUSA takes the money out at 12:01am sharp which would cause my account to run negative & initiate a fee of 34.00 for NSF.....then my check would come in around 3am and be short due to the fees. Now they claim thats been a policy since the beginning....Sure. Then how is this the only time I have been blocked. This is not my first loan.....so the policy aint reach my account til 2020. Cause for the past decade every loan was approved, funded & paid back on full. NOW JAN 3RD 2020.......ITS A PROBLEM. You guys lost, Lost a great customer due to a stupid policy.....yet I bet its people dont even pay yall back.....dumb...just dumb.",5,1

Highly recommended,"The loans are designed with the very specific purpose of keeping poor people in debt indefinitely. Myself, I've paid over $500 into a $600 loan, all on time, and I currently owe MORE than what I borrowed. Since the amount of payment goes down, the outstanding balance never does. If I had not been on the verge of losing my job and becoming homeless, I wouldn't have even thought about it. Point is that if you are poor like me, avoid this place like the plague. Knowing how I worded this, I expect it to be buried.",5,1

When I contacted customer service they were completely rude and took no responsibility. Do not deal with this company. They are completely FRAUDULENT along with their exorbitant interest fees. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE. PREDATORY! They‚Äôll likely respond with some lame automated customer service response saying they‚Äôre sorry and want to help with a customer service number that no one can ever get through.

Good business,It was fast and quick I like that.. they dont bs you around they give you and answer like in sec.  You know how you hate to talk to the people go dig for information or show proof nope not them.. they tell how much you can get and it's up to you if u want to see how much you take they give u nice amount depending on u.. but I only needed half but it turn out couple day later I did guess what they gave me the whole thing .. what other loan company does that.. other loan company give you the amount and once you sign that's it this .. example they say you can get 1200.00 but you only want 600 .. ok turn out I need more guess what u got the 1200.00 it on u what you use up and pay back.. it just sitting their in account just hit the button  u need 600 more and it will tell you when it be in your bank account.. I freaking love this loan company.. and no their no string attack and paying it back is biweekly or how every u wanted is not high like some other company it .. my payments are below 100 every company I been to always 100-200 biweekly...,3,1

We missed a payment, made payment arrangements to make up that payment over 3 months and then they told us that we had to also pay the original payment which is quite high at the same time, resulting in a double payment.  Naturally the loan amounts keeps accruing daily interest and keeps going up and up.  And if you can't pay the now double payment, it only gets worse. If you try and make payment arrangements to pay them back, they absolutely do not want to work with you.    So run as far and as fast as you can.  We should have.",5,1

Always,"They lie and deny. They tell you one thing, but that thing turns out to be false. Then they do absolutely nothing to correct their mistake. They told me to do one thing in order to get approved, and that one thing ended up getting me denied. And even though I was told to do it by the them, they won‚Äôt correct it. I will NEVER do business with them again. They mislead you, lie to you, and then deny you. Then they blame me and treat me like crap. NEVER AGAIN!________________________________________In response to the reply by CashNetUSA, if you were really concerned enough to do an ‚Äúinvestigation,‚Äù you would simply research my account and you would see the whole drawn out saga notated in my account. Multiple times, and multiple days. However, as I originally stated, you lie. You did not, nor do you want to, investigate. Therefore you have real concern to rectify the situation. Or you did investigate and flat out don‚Äôt care. In either event, you are still lying, and now are denying that your lying. I stand by my review 100%. NEVER AGAIN!",5,1

When ibhit the button apply for the loan I assumed it would show me how much my payments would be and how many payments if you were only doing the minimum payment but all I did was put in the dollar amount and hit apply and that was it  again I messed my credit up along time ago and it's so hard to borrow money so again I'm very grateful for the help.

Great job,"I deposited 80.00 into my checking account on November 29th towards payment for Cashnet USA. Thinking I would be able to borrow more money. Now that doesnt even show up as ""paid"". So I have to stiil pay a minimum of 40.00. What happened to that 80.00?",5,1

Fast and efficient approval,"I have been bombarded lately with loan offers from companies I have never heard of. I wanted to get a small loan to help me bridge my finances, upcoming bills as well as Christmas.  I just found a great new job but I haven't been there long enough to get caught up on my money situation. I saw a familiar commercial for CashNet USA as I was getting ready for work, went online and filled out my application (very fast-very easy) and received an approval within 30 minutes and had the funds in my account by mid-afternoon. Not only was I totally impressed with their simple and easy process but by having the funds deposited the same day, well it just took the weight of my financial burden off my shoulders and the stress out of my gut.  You can't go wrong by giving them a few minutes of your time by filing out their forms online. I bet that you will have your financial hiccups sorted out as quickly as I did!!!!!",5,1

Great service,"The payday loans are ‚Äú you see what you get‚Äù. Just like most payday loans!  But I am warning you DONOT TRY THEIR INSTALLMENT LOANS ITS A COMPLETE RIP OFF!!! Example if u get paid every two weeks they will be taking it out every two weeks and a 200.00 payment on a 1200 loan just goes to interest and you are not paying anything on the loan.  If you get in a bind like your hours are cut, they will not offer you any options that are helpful only another payment divided up so no you have two loan payments out there! Every two weeks coming out your checks so it‚Äôs not helping you financially ,   Their are other loans out there way better than this!!  Try them instead.  Lend up is way better than this company.  These people are insensitive vultures!!! Run!!! Don‚Äôt use them!!!",5,1

I was attempting to move my payment up‚Ä¶,"I used to enjoy using their payday loan services and have used them eighteen times this year. However, my recent loan that was supposed to be funded the same day was placed on hold without anyone reaching out to me. Now almost three days later I called them to ask why they have placed my funds on hold and their response is that I need to verify my address and they supposedly sent an email that I never received regarding this. The only email I received was stating that my application was processing and the funding date was the same day and I would be contacted if any additional information was needed.  All I can say is do not depend on them if you have an immediate need as they will leave you hanging and their customer service representatives will be indifferent towards you.",5,1

Cash,Thank you so much. Very easy to apply.,4,1
Great customer service,"At first, the payday loans were good for getting me out of a bind or keeping the electricity on, however beware of the line of credits. My state finally qualified and the interest rate is totally ridiculous. You end up owing over twice as much as you borrowed. For example: $600 becomes a little over $1400 with fees and interest. This will hurt you more than help you in the long run. I am disgusted at myself for being gullible in a time of need and not fully reading the terms and conditions to see how unwise this loan would be. That money (over $500 fees and interest in three months) could have helped my family in so many other ways.",5,1
Why I love CashNet USA,Received money in a timely manner. Great people to borrow from.,5,1

Quick easy process and funds delivered‚Ä¶,Horrible service you get charged everyday for the amount you've taken out and they raise you minimum without notice on top of the 299% interest they give you worst choice I've ever made is coming to these loan sharks the way they are setup is too keep you in their debt. i can wait to pay this loan off and be done with these thieves they aren't here to help anyone just screw you over.,5,1

Cashnet Helped me out when I was in a‚Ä¶,"Run, run the other way as fast as you can. Never ever will I use this crooked place. Read the terms and said you could pay a minimum payment over a period of time or pay your full balance. MISLEADING, I withdrew $100 from my $1,500 line of credit. When I looked at my statement it showed the minimum payment $103.56? How is that a minimum payment, that is my full balance! Contacted them and was told that was my minimum payment, that there was no option for a minimum payment! What BS, MISLEADING, LYING terms in their contract. I maynot be the brightest bulb in the pack, but I do know the difference between a MINIMUM payment and a FULL BALANCE payment. Better off to go to a loan shark on the corner, NEVER NEVER EVER again!!!!",5,1

Cashnet has been an excellent source of‚Ä¶,"I had loans with these people and payed them all off on time never late and now can't get a loan and denied because their letter says they can't verify who I am, or lack of credit. REALLY? Had two other loans and now you can't tell who I am. Not a great way to run a company. Poor customer service and just not a way to keep people happy. Oh well. Will have to find someone else. I had a ""manager"" just call me after posting this review and after verifying everything including the last four of my SSN and it showed I had an account he said they had no control over their computer system and could not even manually enter anything into it to say I was a real person. REALLY? So now I'm going to freeze my credit and all because if you have NO control over what YOUR computers do, then who the hell know who has our information. I would add you probably don't want your ""managers"" calling people and telling them this, cause now going to have to wonder how many people were charged wrong, your computers screwed up paydays, or whatever, and customers were the ones holding the bag, when really it was your computers doing it cause you have no control over them, your employees words not mine. Like I said, had two loans no problems or issues until their computer could not verify me, or cause I had lack of credit. You called and talked to me, yet you could not verify who I am....LOL!! You have been warned people. Makes you wonder how many of these GOOD reviews are even real ones or just their computers generating them?!?!?! Now EVEN more scared since I did not apply again yesterday for a new loan or repeat loan and got this in my email this morning....November 19, 2019Dear kevin hays,Thank you for your recent application for a loan. Your request was carefully considered, and we regret that we are unable to approve your request.Reasons for Denial of CreditYour application was processed by a proprietary scoring system that assigns a numerical value to the various items of information we consider in evaluating an application. These numerical values are based upon the results of analyses of repayment histories of large numbers of customers.The reason(s) you did not score well compared with other applicants were:Unable to verify personal information or identity. Limited credit experience. Insufficient number of credit references. If you have any questions regarding this letter, you should contact us at:CashNetUSA Customer Support175 W. Jackson Blvd. Suite 1000Chicago, IL 60604Phone: (888) 801-9075Fax: (866) 413-3888And remember this is after having TWO loans with them back to back just recently all paid on time, yet they cant figure out who I am, and/or lack of credit.....Horrible.So now they called again and said I was lying about having loans with them, so here is the proof from THEIR OWN WEBSITE. Loan ID: 4725682711/6/2019 Manual Payment ACH$281.59 Paid10/7/2019 Loan Principal ACH$250.00 FundedLoan ID: 470795599/30/2019 Automatic Payment ACH$283.13 Paid8/28/2019 Loan Principal ACH$250.00 FundedI encourage you all to ask your employer for a draw or find other companies than this one as clearly they have zero ethics or customers service skills.",5,1
The only issue I had was trying to‚Ä¶,I absolutely do not like this company I've been with them for almost over two years they're interest is way too high They do not care if it's the last $100 in your account they're going to take it from you They will not go and push it back to a weekly basis they're just going to try and rape you basically I swear whenever I get this paid off I will never be back to these people,5,1
I have never had an issue getting funds‚Ä¶,I'm very impressed with the site. They made my situation very clear.  Relieve my stress.  Thank you for giving me a chance,5,1
I was very pleased with the way that‚Ä¶,"Service is decent from reps (it depends on the luck of the draw), however, this company CANNOT give you a payoff schedule or balance (which means they want you to stay stuck in their loop of paying them forever).  If you need cash quickly due to an unexpected emergency cost, then Cashnet USA should be a ""last resort"" resource.  Just know I have borrowed about $2500.00 from them in the last two years and I have no idea how long it will take to pay them off or how much money it will cost me.  This is scary because they set-up automatic payments every pay period for the MINIMUM balance.  Now if you only pay the minimum balance, there is a daily accrual rate (of an extremely miscellaneous set of numbers, etc 0.81917808 or whatever it is).  This means that if you do not pay MORE than your minimums, the daily accrual balance will continue to accumulate each day that your loan isn't paid off.  With any other loan (student, car, bank, etc, it tells you your principal amount every billing cycle, as well as the interest, so you know at any and all times  what is required to pay to payoff the loan).  With CashNet, there is absolutely NO WAY to tell if you are getting ripped off or not.  The customer service representatives cannot even calculate this for you.  It is very possible CashNet is stealing from their customers.  If you like not knowing exactly where all of your money is going, use Cashnet USA.  Otherwise, if you want to take out a reasonable loan to assist you during hard times, that you can pay off within the year, choose something else.  This company exploits those who aren't knowledgeable about budgeting, credit, or loans.  When I started working with them, I didn't know a thing about how to manage my money so it all sounded good and fine.  But now that I have done research and made plenty of money mistakes I wish that I never worked with them.  USE ONE MAIN FINANCIAL!  They will give you a payoff estimate and will allow you to borrow more money if needed in the event you pay off the original loan.",5,1

They helped me with a loan when no one‚Ä¶,The lady was very helpful in all our questions. Walked me thru the process to change the banking info.,5,1
Associate was pleasant n professional‚Ä¶,"The reps don't help with anything. They don't care and do nothing to help with issues such as changing the bank account number I gave because it's the wrong one. Reading the reviews it seems they have a copy and paste system for responding so they are clearly one lazy company. They will not put you on the line with a manager and will not change my bank account information all the while still upping my outstanding balance every day. The actual company is as bad as a scam company. I went through them on a referral to boost my credit and am getting charged for a $1,000 loan that I never received. They're doing Literally nothing about it. I would much rather date them as nothing as they have done nothing to show they care for their client. This is the worst business experience I've ever had in my life. How do you people get by like this? Well I guess the answers the fact that they're basically scammers themselves. I'm taking legal action. This is preposterous.",5,1
OUTSTANDING JOB,This was fast and easy.  But still font know how much my first payment is,5,1
Because of the holidays coming up,"My aunt was referred to this company by a friend, we thought we'd give them a try. First of all the application was fairly easy, but the level of unprofessionalism was off the charts unacceptable. She got approved for one amount, they then started requesting documents and she sent everything they asked for right away, even while at the bank. They lowered her approval amount which was ok but then started saying they needed more documents which were the same as the first documents they requested. I guess they thought something was gonna change or not add up. They telling her that the member number at her credit union is not the account number. Even after the bank provided a letter of verification stating that her member number is the account number. 9 different representatives were emailing her and that is unprofessional. Then I call in for my aunt and request a supervisor and I got hung up on.... On top of all that my aunt got an email saying that her documents had been received, reviewed, and verified and she would get the money by Monday. Then she got Another email saying her request was cancelled until they get a voided check! I wanted to call and curse them out sooooooo bad but I'll just move on... They are plenty loan companies out there with better interest rates than 325%. Cashnet usa can go to hell! üòä",5,1
I like you people.,Very happy with how easy my experience was,5,1
This was an easy process and I am‚Ä¶,"I made the mistake of filling out all the stuff on their website to get a 300$ loan. I got to the step JUST before finalization when I saw that they charge everyone a 50$ fee to deposit the funds they loan out. This is nothing but ridiculous, brazen greed. I hope the owners of this business can take all their precious THINGS to hell with them to keep em entertained for eternity. Now the company has my info and I constantly get mailers and calls from predatory loan businesses daily; even though I didn't go through with the loan since I'm not stupid or unfathomably desperate (which are the exact people these businesses have been setup to TAKE ADVANTAGE OF). ROT CASHNETUSA, you are one of the sleaziest among a sea of sleazy predatory lending businesses who prey on the least fortunate people in society.",5,1

Wonderful..Thank U!,"Horrible Company, one second it approves you but if you change your mind about the amount you want to borrow they will deny you. The rep I just spoke to states that if you login you will have to accept the offer they give you with the amount they give you and you can not log out and think about it because once you log out and log back in they will run your credit AGAIN and possibly give your a higher loan amount and might/might not get approved and if not approved you will need to reapply in 30 days. The rep did start to become ugly and when I nicely asked for a manager he stated there is no one in charge to speak to because its a Saturday.",5,1
I can honestly say they helped me out‚Ä¶,Wow it was so easy. Didn't have a hard to get approved.  I would recommend everyone to cashNetusa...i got the money really fast....would use it again.,5,1

Great,Whether or not I get approval it‚Äôs an accessible App.üá∫üá∏,5,1
Very fast simple and easy,It‚Äôs. Truly ridiculous that none of your reps can answer valid questions and maybe not because they do t have the training but because your company is worse than a loan shark. You don‚Äôt have a clue about several questions asked because it seems once you got the deal signed it‚Äôs f what the customer concerns might be or as a rep put it very unprofessionaly ‚Äú cash net gonna get their money first and foremost‚Äù I‚Äôve made my payments on time but it seems the company reps don‚Äôt have answers particularly because of the daily interest rate. I remember years ago watching I believe mintell Williams who I was once a fan of promoting this company and one of the tv network personnel grilled him about representing cash net because the company was basically raping so to speak customers with out outrageous interest rates that should be against the law. I wasn‚Äôt that familiar with the company and I know I needed the money at the time and I signed on the dotted line but never again. I know you are making legal money but you guys should be ashamed of yourselves for taking advantage of hard working customers. On top of it all you cannot answer what I assume to be simple questions pertaining to my account.,5,1
Fast and efficient,Super fast service online. They can very you or if a pickle very fast. A bit pricey though.,5,1
Predatory lending.,"I tried to pay off my loan on the due date, I was placed on hold for 4 to 5 hours at a time... The company wants to take 4 and 5 days just to retrieve their pay back which is horrible. I couldn't believe that I couldn't use my debt card to pay off..",3,1

Excellent customer service,"After carefully reading all the reviews I decided to give Cashnet a try. They are terrible to deal with within 4 weeks they took nearly $500 from my account when the payments were $110 every 2 weeks(which was also a misunderstanding thought was a monthly payment) .... they take more than what was agreed upon and have for 2 weeks put me in the negative with $72 in overdraft fees.... which they won't pay you back... now next week they want $286 for their 2week  payment which is nearly 3 times my payment. Don't do business with Cashnet... they are thieves. Oh btw, my balance after $500 paid in on a $1000 loan is still at $1200....",5,1

Amazing,"My first experience with CashNetUSA was great. It was easy to apply and get approved. My only advice is to check the day you apply. I applied on a Saturday and was told my loan would fund on Monday but it actually funded on Tuesday. So if you need the money real fast, consider that Sunday and bank holidays may delay funding. Other than that they are accurate  and I would recommend them for short term loans.",5,1

I do believe that Cash Net USA is‚Ä¶,"Done Borrowed once, paid all back and they have the nerve to say they charged me while the money was waiting to clear. 3.18 cents. Screw you, I paid before it was due. Shove your 3 $",5,1
"No problems,...no hassles,...greatly‚Ä¶","Please I urge you PLEASE LOOK AT THE SAMPLE FEES BEFORE BORROWING FROM THIS COMPANY üëé, These 4 & 5 star ratings have to be paid.

I borrowed $700 and have made three payments of over $120 and the outstanding balance shows $986. I was so confused üòï, so I called and was told their fees.

This was a very efficient company that‚Ä¶,"When I used CashNetUSA the first time months ago, everything went smoothly. I was approved, money was in my USAA account the same day, and my loan was paid back on time. Fast forward to me needing to use their service again when an unexpected vehicle expense came up and I needed a little extra cash to get me through til payday less than 5 days away. Imagine my shock when I was declined for $100 loan (minimum amount) even though my circumstances have not changed at all since I was APPROVED the last time. Same job for the past 9 years, and no changes with my credit  (USAA monitors through Experian). I called and was not given a reason and that I would receive an email. The email stated 3 reasons 1. They couldn't verify my identity (What??) 2. Limited credit experience (Huh?} Over 10 yrs, apartment in my name, car payment in my name, /bills all in my name, Capital One MC (that I ended up having to use because of your denial) 3. Not enough credit references (Say What?) Refer to #2. I now use Earnin which allows you to borrow off your paycheck for a small loan. I prefer to use this instead of my Capital One credit card to avoid the interest.  No hassle and No credit BS. I have a large social media following and I will be telling all my followers on all my platforms about my horrible experience with your company. You have no loyalty to your customers!",5,1
The process was easy,Quick and easy. Love the credit line without a card.,5,1

"Yes, Yes, Yes","If it were possible I'd give 0 stars, this is by far the absolute worst company in existence! The loan is extremely easy to get but just as hard if not harder to pay off, when you make a payment your balance goes up instead of down. When called for payoff and address to send we were given a Dallas address (then according to customer service rep they send to Chicago so they can collect more fees) which is where we mailed payoff amount we were given. The check cleared our bank four days later but eight days later and our account has not been updated as a matter of fact we are told that account is past due and cash net attempted to pull a payment out of our bank account, we had to spend $32 to prevent it from being debited because it would have taken 10 to 14 days for a refund should payment have gone through. Keep in mind account has been paid off. Calling customer service is a complete joke I was on hold for 46 minutes today before I gave up!!!",5,1

"Overall good experience, but the interest!

Thank you,"CashNet takes the time to educate you on what they provide and their service experts take time to understand any questions you may have.  So far, my experience has been very good.",5,1
Enjoyed the experience,"The fees are exorbitant!  I knew that the interest rate is very high, because that is clearly visible when you apply for the loan. But I didn't realize that there are major fees in addition to the interest!  Looking back at their website, I see that is does say there are fees, but they don't make that obvious when you apply for the loan.I was worried I might have to take my dog to the vet, and so out of desperation, I requested $250 dollars.  But then she started acting better.  I paid back the full amount, $250, in several days.  For that, I got charged $45.  $8 of it is interest.  $37 of it is fees.  No way can it cost nearly that much to process a bank transaction!  That's 5 bucks tops.  Charging that much for a bank transaction is just exploitative!",4,1
Great customer service Horrible app,"It‚Äôs was very simple, enter the information they ask for, and literally within minutes you have your answer weather you was approved or not. Once approved, you will electronically sign, enter the amount you need to draw out from your credit limit and they will deposit directly into your bank account, that easy.",4,1

It's slow and takes you forever to pay back what you owe. The new terms and conditions are ridiculous. The annual interest percentage rate is 299% ü§Øwhich I have never heard of and does not sound legit at all. I've been a customer for a long time but I feel I am being taken advantage of more than being helped. Not sure if I will ever use yall again. This is very upsetting especially for customers like me who use yall alot. It has taken me over a month to pay yall back cause everytime you make a payment, more interest is added. Sorry to give a bad review but I am very upset. The old way was better and more convenient. Sometimes change isnt necessary.",5,1

Excellent customer service,"I have been a CashnetUSA customer for more than 5 years. I Have had to use them a few times when something out of the blue comes up or my child needed school clothes, scouting dues, etc... I only get paid once a month and sometimes, making money last that entire month isn‚Äôt easy. This school year, my child needed a Chromebook for school. Well, I found this out a week before school started and my monthly pay day was a week AFTER school started. So, I turned to CashnetUSA once again to help out. I applied for a $350 payday loan and within 3 hours, I had the money in my checking account! Holy moly! That was FAST; same day deposits are awesome! Thank you for being there for me when I needed just a little extra help. I have recommended CashNetUSA to my friends and family and will continue to do so. These guys are the real deal!!! For my customer loyalty, I get a 25% discount on my loan fees... they reward loyalty and I greatly appreciate it!",5,1
Shannon W. (Happy Customer!),I loved this company. Fast & easy 2 get approved. Quick deposits && manageable payment arrangements as well.,5,1
Great service,"Where to begin.  CashNetusa is the worst lender.  Sure they will approve almost anyone...but good luck actually recieving your funds!  I applied for funding on 7/5/19.  I checked my account the next day and there was no deposit.  Come to find out they had the wrong account number in the system.  So I called customer service and tried to resolve the situation. Customer service was horrible. They seemed annoyed that I was trying to resolve the issue.On 7/8/19 I sent and a ACH direct deposit form with the correct account information and routing number. I was informed that I would have to wait until the transaction returned. After waiting a few more days I called my bank, and they said if I were to receive the transaction number from the lender, they could tell me if it had already been returned, but most likely it already had been. So, I called, and asked for the transaction number, needless to say I did not get it, but I got several reasons why they couldn't give it to me, and was told that they were looking into it and would let me know when they had resolved the issue. I never did receive an email or call letting me know they had resolved the issue. However they were nice enough to contact me on 7/21/19 too confirm payment on the advance I never recieved!  After telling them good luck on receiving payment with the wrong account information...they cancelled the payment ach as a ""courtesy"".Fast forward to yesterday, 9/12/19, when I decided to once again give them a chance to earn my business.  I requested a draw, and when I checked my account this morning, there was no deposit.   The reason?  THEY SENT IT TO THE SAME WRONG ACCOUNT NUMBER.  The inept fools never corrected the information I sent in back in July!!!I am beside my self at the ineptitude of these people, the complete lack of customer service, and the non-chalant attitude they have.  They are more than able to contact you too make sure they recieve their money...but they really could care less when the situation is reversed.  Needless to say, they will never get my business again...and I intend on posting this same review on every site possible to warm others to seek funding elsewhere...as well as to warn them of the complete stupidity of this business.",5,1
The process was quick and easy,"This company has great customer service they were able to help me and fast, thanks again",5,1
Great experience,"Excellent service, especially for people like myself whose credit tanked because of illness and inability to work.  It takes so long to build a good credit rating.

When I sent an email to verify it they responded with an email addresses to the wrong person. I spoke with someone through chat because of the wait for phone assistance. I was informed they could not do anything until the money was taken back out of the account they deposited it in. Then when I asked what happens if they don‚Äôt get the money back o was informed that I‚Äôd still be responsible. The time frame is 5 to 10 business days. This is terrible service. I needed cash fast for medical reasons for my daughter. I will most definitely be informing my attorney if I‚Äôm stuck with having to make these payments.,5,1
So fast and easy,I had a good experience. I only needed a small amount till pay day. I requested $200 and got approved for $150 and I have to pay back $170. The process was fast and easy.

was easy and seamles,"This company is terrible, they are robbing people. They charge very high interest and a very small percentage of your monthly payments goes toward principal.

Thank u guys for everything always‚Ä¶,I have tried to get a loan and I received more than enough income however when I call the customer service the lady was helpful and I have 3 different accounts and for some reason I applied a year before last and then I just recently applied and I was declined why would I be declined if I have more than enough in my account and verifying my bank institution and I'm still decline I think this is really a scam fraud and I'm making sure that my accounts are secured if I have to call report fraudulent activity but I have given up I would never try this CashNetUSA because it is a scam obviously I'm not asking for much when I apply for the loan and I'm still denied when I have more than enough to make installments on my loan why would I be denied unfortunately they can't provide that information as mention from the representative they will have to provide it through email but this is very odd because this is the second time I have been declined and I should not been declined I have bank with my bank institution for over 5 years receive direct deposit and should not have been declined I don't recommend this to anyone especially when someone is in need of a loan and yet still decline fraud all day long .,4,1

It was easy with the chat option,"I have been a customer of CashNetUSA for quite some time and until recently I have not had a problem but this is the first time I had a line of credit instead of a personal loan.  I am very unhappy how CashNetUSA handles their LOC.  They go on a statement basis regardless of the order of the transactions.  I have reported them to the BBB as they are stealing money I already paid off and charging me for a balance I paid off and not just the new draw I made on my LOC.  Once this dispute is handled, I will pay off my balance and never do business with this company again!  Don't do it if you don't have to.  They only care about their money not customer satisfaction as they claim",5,1
You guys are the best.Sometimes a bill‚Ä¶,Great place to do Business with  I highly recommend doing business with them ..,5,1

Awesome and helpful,The only problem I had was with the chat service. After I got all the information I needed and tried to put it into practice I kept getting more messages that required me to stop the process to reply. When I returned to the application it had dumped the most recent work forcing me do it over again several times as the chat rep kept on after i told him I was done and explained what his persistence was doing to my application process. Other than the that frustration and I'm sure the person was only doing what he was trained to do my experience thus far has been positive!,5,1

Excellent Customer Service,Thank you for helping,5,1
Great,"Getting the cash I urgently needed using CashNetUSA was amazingly easy but most importantly it was fast! In less than 24 hrs from the moment I started the application, I had cash in hand! CashNetUSA was my ""safety net!"" The one aspect that could use improvement is (my) payments. Possibly an online amortization chart, allowing the customer to choose payment amounts which would then calculate how many payments are required to repay the line of credit off in full would make the process/experience perfect....although, from a business/profit standpoint showing the customer how much they will actually be paying back may cause pause, LOL! That would kinda cut your own throat I suppose but on the other hand, if money is needed, repayment amounts aren't significant in times of desperation & need. I suggest ""CashNetUSA"" use the ""Safety Net"" reference in advertising, if so, I'd like my advertising & marketing fee deposited directly into my bank account. üòâ",5,1
A great line of credit,You have help when I need you must .I thank you,5,1

The only thing is that I wish notes were a little lower but on a positive note it will only take me a few month's to pay the loan off instead of Year's like with other loan company's. Thank You CadhNetUSA.,5,1
The website is always in great working‚Ä¶,"It was a blessing and joy to seeing that I had been approved for my line of credit. After struggling for several years financially being on disability, the sense of relief I felt was nothing short of amazing.

My experience with Cashnetusa has‚Ä¶,"Quick and easy, done in a timely manner",5,1
Quick easy to work with,"The serivce is good, fast and friendly and its suppose to be.  They make it this easy so you can get the loan with ease. But beware and plan carefully.  Make sure if you get a loan from this place you plan on paying it back ASAP! I can't stress that enough because the annual interest rate is 299% and it is accured daily. I have a payment that is processing on the 26 of July, but on the 25th of July they hit me with another interest charge of $183, making my next payment due in a couple of weeks of $270, on a loan of $1600 and now I owe over $2100.00.  This has now become a night mare for me just to bring the balance down so they won't hit you with the daily interest rate. All this is outlined in the agreement, but you really need to have a professional lawyer read over it. They take advantage of people to make sure that you are absolute sure before getting a loan from these people. I wish I never had.",5,1
Got my money the next day as promised!,fast and easy to qualify!! money in the bank that same night,5,1
Awesome company,They run the commercial excessively in my state then after they get all your information they say they don't have services in my state. So why do they need all my information?,5,1

This company is a company that takes advantage of people in this country when it is struggling enough. These type of companies should be force regulated by the government. They should be outlawed,This company is a company that takes advantage of individuals. It charges the highest rate possible on daily interest. You can only hope they get ran out of business by reasonable companies that offer fair and affordable rates. BestEgg offers actual companies with normal loans. This place is operated like a check writing service. Do not use them.

A valuable lesson here.,"CashNetUsa has taught me a very important lesson--make sure you read all the fine print before you make a deal. About a month ago I borrowed $1500 and was hit with an automatic withdrawal payment of over $350 for my first payment. Now I have a $430+ payment due and owe a total of over $1700..

Beware,"Beware! CashNet are always there when you need it. However, be careful! The loan docs don't say how much you will be paying each payment until you get approved and the money is already on the way.

Payments are super high (car payment) for the first few months and then get lower to where you can afford it. It is not a steady payment plan where you can budget. I have it listed under ""last resort"" when I need a loan because of this. Beware!",2,0

I went online verified my info and entered my routing and account number. It was doing anything when i hit apply so I called just to find out I was not approved but was actually denied and she wasnt able to tell me why. She said it may be because of the bank I use but why would they send letters lying saying your approved for a certain amount when in reality you might not be.

What raised RED FLAGS was when I was asked for my banking user name and password.

Im like but I was told I could do another loan yesterday with no problem , I asked her can you extend the due date by 2 days please so I can take my loan today it is Friday and I need the instant funding because the weekend is coming and I cant get instant funding on the weekend , she again told me I would have to wait until Monday to reapply for my loan.

Good company,"If I could give less then one star I MOST DEFINITELY would!!! This company is the opitomy of a DISHONEST loan shark!!! I sent a cashiers check to pay off my account and first the man on the phone gave me the WRONG address to send the check. I had to call to get the payoff amount. My check was returned to the bank because of the address and my bank said that this it rather customary because it gives them more time to add interest to your account and at 299% yearly that is can be anywhere from a few dollars and up. Mine got up to $15+ a day while waiting for this HORRID company to fix my account...but they STILL want the interest and refuse to fix it. My bank sent the check out a second time to the correct address and CashNet USA cashed my check but then the next month reversed the check off my account but never returned the funds. Also in going over my account VERY CAREFULLY I found MANY discrepencies. There were a few months where they took payment but NEVER posted it to my account or reversed the payment and never returned the monies. On 1/14/21 my year to date interest was $134.70 with $260.42 charged for the month. Then on 2/11/2021 my year to date interest was $1,053.26 with $322.60 charged in interest for the month. I'm not a math teacher but that doesn't add up. I reached out to the company SEVERAL times to fix these issues but to no avail. Finally I gave up...and they stopped harassing me mid 2021. Well a couple months ago I found out that they sent my account to a collection agency for  an unpaid and delinquent account . I had to go back to my bank to get a copy of the cashed cashier's check dated 10/14/2020. I THINK this is finally settled...but the collection agency is not responding to my emails...so who knows.

People with bad credit or in my case brand new credit should be given the privilege of getting such a low apr.

Not quite the case. Still waiting for an email that was to be sent momentarily. We endured some hurricane damage and needed something fast and were let down by their ads. May want to have back up plan if you have a real need or emergency.I have contacted the number and they could not help. The email showed up days later. Stating basically I had no credit which was the purpose of making a small loan. Anyway the reply is nice but the facts are calling got no answers and was told come back in 30 days? I'll pass. I'm a customer and without us you dont have a business. Most places forget that as they grow. That is unfortunate. Thank you for the computer generated report but not exactly customer service.,1,0

Very happy,this cashnetusa is a scAM!!!!! I only borrow $1600 and paid off but  they still taking out my account!!!

I fell as if cashnet is stealing money‚Ä¶,"The customer service has been fantastic overall. I have had to submit  my loan application 3 times, including uploading my paystub. The only emails I have received are to re-sign my application and to resubmit my paystub. I understand the signing and approval need to be done in the same day. When I submit my application at 11am on the second day and the offices don't close until 8pm, one would expect it could be approved in that timeframe. Instead, I received yet another email that my application had been withdrawn.Edit: I have now finally received the approval that my loan will be processed.Edit again: it is now Monday. I started this process on Wednesday. My application was once again withdrawn and had to be resubmitted. The only reason for a second star is the customer service agents are really nice and professional.",1,0

not worth the‚Ä¶,"EVERY time I call I'm on hold for 30 minutes or more. When I have spoken to a rep, they were insensitive and snippy.  They hide the fact that payments are bi-weekly, not monthly.

Not happy with interest rate!!!,"Was thankful to receive a loan when no one else would extend credit. However, that comes at a price. With a 299% interest rate, it is nearly impossible to pay down quickly; the interest alone made up the majority of my bi-weekly payment. The website is nearly useless, you can't skip a payment or request a payoff there. They say that they were helping people during the pandemic, but I didn't see it. If you skipped a payment, the interest still accrued, and in two weeks, you now have two payments due. If you want to postpone the second one, you have to use their inefficient phone system. Glad that the regulations in Virginia prevents them from doing further business there.",2,0
Very excellent,"No different than the other one companies that say 99% approval rate, if y'all have helped 3 million people with your financial services, how many applications have you received in total?

I owe $300 as of today but the funds that were supposed to come into my account was sent out to the wrong account. I am a hotel front desk agent, and what Cash Net USA did was equivalent of me checking a guest into an occupied room. One mistake that is supposed to never be tolerated was made by Cash Net USA. I will no longer do business with Cash Net USA. I do business with a few other payday advance agencies, and none of them have ever sent me money, and ended up funding the wrong account.

My review is strictly off of the 275.85% yearly APR, and In addition multiple other daily fees. If you are in a life and death situation I‚Äôd say go for it (bc how worst can it get), but you are literally paying whole car note payments . Most of your bi weekly payment is interest. I was initially paying 4-500 dollars monthly on $1,600 loan with barely no movement in the loan going down. Now I owe $1100(paid extra on one of the payments ) which is $330/monthly payment. So I‚Äôll be doing what I didn‚Äôt want to do and pull out of my 401K to pay this off this loan this week because this loan will never get paid off. you would literally have to pay twice the monthly amount to see any difference.Please listen and stay away.

Not 10 minutes!,"Whatever you do, avoid Cashnetusa. Their fees and interest rates are unreasonable. On a $1000 cash advance, they charged me over $750 in fees and interest in a three month period. I made three $250 payments and my balance never went down in three months. The next month, they increased my balance. No matter what you do, even making extra payments, they continue to tack on outrageous fees. Even during this pandemic when people are struggling financially, they do not care. Cashnetusa is an example of what is wrong with America - Corporate GREED. For a $1000 loan that I took out in December, they have charged me over $700 in fees and interest. I have made three payments of over $250 since December 2020 and not one cent went towards my balance. I still owe $1008. This virus and pandemic has crushed many people‚Äôs lives. I am no different. Yet corporations like Cashnetusa don‚Äôt care. As long as it is money in their pockets, people like me don‚Äôt matter. I have reached out to customer service for answers, a solution and just help and understanding. I have received NOTHING. I was even told by customer service that my next payment will not be $250 but $300. This is a company that takes advantage of people who can least afford it. $700 in fees is obscene and heartbreaking. I cry every time I think about it.

How is this helping people during this difficult time? I isn't I want to see a reduction in my balance so I can pay this loan off. This is so difficult for me and extremely upsetting.

I will Not EVER borrow money from this awful company! Yet is ridiculous the way you pile on the interest making it impossible for someone like me to catch up and pay down the debt. I took a cash advance for $1000 in December. Since then I have made three payments of over $250 and my balance is still $108. No money has gone to paying down the $1000. This is ridiculous.

They prefer ach so they can force your bank. I thought it would be like a higher interest credit card but Cash Net managed to far out pace a bad credit card in fees. Luckily I can pay for this mess but alot of people wouldn't. Their only possible business plan would have to be to get as much in interest as possible before you quit playing it or go bankrupt.,1,0

Therefore you are not able to reapply until after 3:30 PM and funds are not sent to your account until the following business day which would be Monday.This is definitely misleading and false advertisement.

Whatever you do,"I made the unfortunate decision to borrow money from these leeches in 2019. The interest rates are ridiculously high and I paid them back in full in September of 2019. I just received a letter in the mail January 2021 about how they've sent me to collections on a $350 debt that I don't owe. I took pictures and documented everything and I paid them off IN FULL. They said they only credited $1000 even though my bank account shows that it was charged more than that for the full month. Every time I try to call the people are completely useless. Their customer service is just as atrocious as their 300% interest rates. If they were going to send me to collections for a debt I already paid, why wait a year and a half? Were they hoping I would forget about it so they could get more money from me? This is the worst place I have ever done business with and I'm not paying a penny more to them.Edit: I've called twice and the customer service reps refused to help me and all they did was tell me to call collections. They said they could only drop it if I get a letter from cashnetusa  saying that my debt was paid in full which you refuse to do. My debt was $1,133.44 and I paid you $1,134. They only credited my account with paying $1,000, so did you pocket the extra $134? I even called cashnetusa THAT DAY and they said I paid it off. When I called collections they said you sold my ""debt"" to collections 9 days after I paid it off, but I just got a letter about it THIS MONTH, almost a year and a half later saying I owe $350.

Was told that I qualified for a certain loan and actually wasn‚Äôt!!,My payments are never the same and my balance goes up then back down.. Makes no sense.,1,0
Cashnetusa is an example of what is‚Ä¶,WORSE experience  EVER with a loan place!! If I could go back od go to a credit union  or something.  This place called me made arrangements and still ignored my arrangement. My child was in the hospital for 3 wks got out WOTH COVID (3wks Emergency surgery appendicitis then went back bc they nicked colon then on release day found out she was pos. For covid FROM HOSPITAL.) SO obviously no work while child is in hospital.  So the lady acted like she understood and would help but after phone call they took part of rent money then I call and there's NO notes of my arrangements so SOMEONE didn't do THEIR job and MY Family suffers. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!!,1,0
During this time when we are all‚Ä¶,Horrible customer service once you have paid down your balance and are not asking for more money. I have been told for at least 3 months that my account is in review which means they lock your account and do not allow you to see statements. I have never missed a payment.  I have called and emailed and my issue remains unresolved.,1,0
DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!,"Every time That I inquire about the best time to make an additional payment that will go towards my principle balance, I am never given a straight answer.  I just paid over $1100.00 towards my balance in a 10 day time period and only $600 went towards my principle.  That is ridiculous!!!!  I made the extra payments to bring down my principle balance but the way they have these loans set up is to take as much principle up front as possible.  Which prevents anyone from paying them down quickly.  They are never able to tell me when is the best time to make an additional payment that benefits me.  Total SHAM!  How anyone can give this company a rating above one star seems suspect to me.  I do not believe that these are legitimate ratings.",1,0

It is unfortunate that it is not clearly explained how expensive it is to get a loan or line of credit from them. The interest is accrued daily on the outstanding balance of the loan. The annual APR is 299%. Yes!!  My advice is to read the fine print, ask questions, tough it out, go to your local bank. This was by far one of the worse mistakes I have ever made getting a line of credit while going through medical crisis, recovering from family related COVID-19, and struggling with financial hardship to pay for medical bills .",2,0

Giving the lowest rating because I‚Ä¶,Cashnet reduced my available credit shortly after covid 19 shut down a lot of places. Even though my income was not affected at all. Nothing changed for me. They just reduced my amount available for no reason. When people needed help the most Cashnet failed to help. This is the worst kind of company. Instead of being there for their customers they made getting money harder. Don't do business with this company if you care about companies that are actually there for their customers.,1,0
They are crooks,"If you are desperate enough to use cashnetusa you should probably rob a bank. You won't get screwed in prison as hard as cashnetusa will screw you. I had used a different service and expected the fees would be similar, but cashnetusa charges much higher fees and they start the interest on day 1. No chance to avoid the interest by paying in full within a month, they are hammering you from the very start. But the absolute worst thing they do is they hold your payment so they can continue charging their exorbitant interest. Made a payment 2 days ago, they acknowledge the payment was made, but my balance does not reflect it and the 8 bucks a day in interest keeps getting charged.",1,0
cashnet is a loanshark,This company has been drafting payments from my account for over a year..on the wrong day. When I changed jobs my payday changed but they would not change it to match. This has caused countless amounts of overdraft fees for me. I have reached out to them several times to help. But they won't.  This has to be unlawful.  I think I'm going to seek some legal help.,1,0
I would rate 0 stars if I could,I got a loan last year when my car broke down . They increased my limit and I always make on time payments. If you have the money to pay them off instantly then sure . But making monthly payments is a no. My BI WEEKLY PAYMENTS were 250. A piece so 500 overall. My loan was for 1700. No matter how much I paid or did I could NOT pay it off. I also asked for a settlement offer just anything to get this debt off me and account closed. Customer service informed me that they don‚Äôt do settlement offers which I‚Äôm sure is a lie. Anyways I did some debt consolidation and just paid the whole thing off and I hope to never deal with these ppl again . Definitely would not recommend as a lender . The high interest rate makes it impossible for you to pay them off. Yesterday my payoff was 1823 and today my payoff was 1872 . Please unless you‚Äôre seriously desperate do not go this route ! There are definitely better lenders with lower interest . Good luck,1,0

Good,"Absolutely ridiculous. I was approved for $800 yesterday and was told I would get the funds by end of business day.

Awhile later I hadn't gotten my funds yet so i called and gave my account number to confirm, they also said it was correct. I called back one more time not understanding why NY funds are not in the account just to find out, it wasn't the right account number. I tried giving her the right number and was told I couldn't, and it could take up to 5 business days to correct then error. Is this some kind of scam to get my social security number, bank info. Etc??? U can either deposit it on the right account as I asked or I can take it up on social media, the new, or better yet my father works for a radio station out here called The Fox.

I Called them on payday and gave them my credit card..to pay off my 500.00 loan Then when I went online and saw I could now borrow my old 1800.00 I was going to go ahead and fix the back yard fawcett and fix my indoor bathtub fawcett. I am having problems with it too.I apllied and spoke with this girl and she said she would put it through.Then I got a call from cashnet usa about 10 minutes later and I answered it and they hung up..this was in the morning then about 530pm I get another call from a different girl telling me that now I have to send her my bank statements.Hmmmm thats odd after two years of loans from them and a loan I just did 2 weeks ago and paid back now I have to send them my personal bank account statements ..( and these people are working from home) No way I am not sending my bank statements to anyone.This just does not sound right all of a sudden now they need my bank statements.So I told Her I don't want to do the loan because I am not going to send ANYONE my bank statements they want to loan me the money and get the 300.00 or 400.00 back from loaning it to me that's fine ..But its not fine that all of a sudden they need my bank statements.So the next day I called to speak with a supervisor and of course not available and then this rep told me that I now need my front and back of my ID and I also Need my Bank statements too.

It is will take me 18 months to pay off this TRAPPED loan.  These people are a rip off. i will look into filing a class action suit . i do not recommend applying for line of credit with CASH NET.

I have been a CNUSA customer for 5 years,"I use  to love this company. A little expensive but okay. That is until they switch my loan from a payday loan to a line of credit. The line of credit adds interest to your account everyday depending on how much you borrow. My loan adds between 40 and 50 dollars daily for a month. By the time my payment comes out only a couple of dollars goes toward my loan, the rest is interest. With my payday loan I always made 4 payments and it was paid off. Do not except lines of credit.  If they don't do payday loans in your state please consider another way to get the money you need.  They are worst than loan sharks. I wish I had read the terms first  but I just assumed it worked like the payday loans. Been with them for years. I called a said I couldn't make my payment of 347.00 dollars so they told me I could pay 128.00. When payment came due, they charged me the 128.00 plus the 347.00. How was that for help. If I could afford the 347.00 why would they think I could afford 2 payments at once. That was almost 500.00. My account paid it and I had an over draft fee.PLEASE RECONSIDER YOUR OPTIONS BEFORE DEALING WITH THESE PEOPLE.  If it's a payday loan that's fine but PLEASE DON'T DO A LINE OF CREDIT.

To review all of this CashNet USA is‚Ä¶,payments broke down keep you paying more over time than structured payments. Makes perfect sense to keep a person on the hook. If you don't need a 300% interest loan don't do it!! I dont have any questions for you. I understood the interest rate i understand repayment what i did not understand is fluctuations in payment that didn't even cover the principle and then one that did I'm sorry but steady payment of the same cost across the board is kinda a practice that needs to be adopted by screwing you out of a lower payment to not even cover the principle at all is kinda a poor way to extend a loan well past the payoff time.

Needless to say, I will be making additional payments from now on with a goal to pay this thing off ASAP!!!  I would only recommend CashNetUSA as a LAST resort if you know that you will have a windfall of cash in the near future to pay them off because an APR of 299% means most of your payments are going to interest.

299% apr,Outrageous interest rate and payment setup that makes no sense. Do not make your situation worse by borrowing money from this company. Most of not all of the 5 star reviews are fake. This business prays on the poor and keeps you in the hole and in debt to them. If you can pay off your loan with them and go to a credit union. This company is setup to keep you making payment that do little to your principle balance because the interest rate is sky high. It should be illegal what they do but I‚Äôm sure some lobbyist has paid off senators to keep them in business. I got $1400 and when I started paying it off they lowered it to $1100 and said it was due to Covid. So at a time of crisis you lower my line of credit. Ended up paying back over $3000 in just 6 months and that was because I paid it off early. Not worth it. Please listen to my review and steer clear.,1,0
They have some great customers willing‚Ä¶,They are taking more from you than they are actually helping you. They putting you in more debt than what you started with before borrowing.

This loan is meant for repayment within a few weeks to keep from getting those ridiculous customary fees. It should be against the law to charge the amount this company charges. My customary fees are over $10 per day plus $1.00 of interest per day. It‚Äôs outrageous! You can‚Äôt pay towards the original balance, it doesn‚Äôt work that way. If you pay more, it‚Äôs eaten up by the high customary fees. Just pay it in full and be done with them.",1,0
Thanks for the help!!!!,"This company is horrible to borrow a loan from. What they don‚Äôt tell you is for $100 borrowed they add on $15. On top of that you gain interest every single day to the remaining balance. My loan was $850. After the additional $15 it was about $985. I have already paid $1075.15 back. But due to the amount increasing by 0.8192% every single day I still have to pay $742 back. That amount will increase every day until my next payment date I set up with automatic payments. DO NOT GET A LOAN FROM HERE. I make 2 payments every month and it‚Äôs never a flat amount, each time the amount I am paying is different from the time before. This company is a total scam. Do not fall for the reviews on their site. I‚Äôve asked a customer service rep for help explaining this process and they did everything to try and avoid my questions by repeating the same thing over and over and then had the audacity to ask if I could pay the remaining balance today.

Shady,"I would not recommend Cashnet., only because with the interest rate of 299% they have been paid over the value of my orginal credit line. Right now I'm paying over 200 dollars and they charge 168 dollars interest for the month. I have had my credit line over a year. They have always been professional and while I needed the money this type of credit line in the end becomes a greater debt than the orginal reason for my request. I would highly recommend a traditional loan and if you can't get one borrow from family and pay them back. Exhaust all your possibilities before considering a credit line even if you have bad credit. If it weren't for the ridiculous 299% interest rate they would other wise be fine. In addition in light of COVID 19 you'd think the company with all the money they have made would bring the interest down to a traditional one to help their customers instead they reduce the credit line line which isn't horrible but the monthly cost still...is outrageous. Please look at your options before coming to this company. The people who own this company are not generous, this is purely business and they are not a life line to your financial problems.,this is business and you need to seriously consider that when looking for money for a short term problem.",1,0

This is how long time customers are treated! I feel clients should be made aware of the payments before they submit to give them a chance to decline,  it's not fair and immoral,  and deceptive!",1,0
I have been a customer for a few months‚Ä¶,"For people that only have high interest loans Cashnet was not the worse until covid-19. When so many companies are taking extra measures to help people, Cashnet does the exact opposite. Cashnet reduced everyone's loan amount for absolutely no reason. With no change in your income or anything else they reduce the amount you can borrow. What a horrible choice for a company to make. I will no longer use CASHNET.",1,0
its good to get some money but paying‚Ä¶,"Worst ever I ask for help my hours got short couldn‚Äôt make a payment they asked me if I could make it the following day or I ask someone to borrow money to pay no help no nothing never miss a payment ,1500 loan still paying since 12-12-2019",1,0
Didn't even get a chance to reapply..,I didn't even get to put in an amount before being denied nothing. I think that is stupid that you have a person fill out an app and don't know their expected amount being requested. Fix your method. And your tv advertisement is a LIE.THANK YOUI'm not going to try again. It's a waste of time the second round.,1,0
cash net is great for a payday loan‚Ä¶,"F these people. Applied a got denied and said my credit was too low when I know it‚Äôs not then I check and it says it pulled it from some unknown credit agency and said my credit score was 300 points lower than my fico and other scores. My wife is with them however and paid her loan today and went to reloan because we NEED the 255 because times are hard with this PANDEMIC but what do they do, they lower everyone‚Äôs limit to 100 because of the pendemic when other companies are extending dates and waiving fees this pos company lowers and screws people over, this says a lot about this company and I would advise never to go to this place WAAAAY better options out their that don‚Äôt ruin your credit.",1,0
I had a hard time with no work,"Do not get a line of credit (loan) with CashnetUSA, unless you can pay back the entire amount within the next 30 days. It's a rip off geared toward the poor. Yes, it is fast cash. Yes, it is there when you need it most. Is the stress worth it? No. You will be paying so much cash back, that you will resent yourself for ever getting it.",1,0
I've paid back my loan twice now,Very bad. Minimum payment high and always increasing biweekly.,2,0
Warning!!,"DO NOT USE CASHNET!! As a return customer, with an account paid off EARLY and in good standing, not 1 but 2 representatives lied to me about when and how I paid off my account, and when I could receive funds! They took my last $80 and have left my family with no money, no food, etc for 4 days during the Coronavirus outbreak. I have learned my lesson! So disappointed with this company! Please don't be as foolish as me. I just had nowhere else to turn!",1,0
Please Don‚Äôt Use This Service.,"I would NOT recommend CashNetUSA to anyone. They tell you they dont go off your credit report. I make $135,000 per year with copies of the last 7 months of my paychecks at the same job ive been at for 3.5 years. I have a checking account with bank of America and an email address wich is the only things they say you need to get a loan and I was turned down for any amount of a loan including $250. My credit score is 550. The only reason they would turn me down is because of my low credit score that they say they dont go off. Stay away from cashnetusa unless you have a great credit score and you just want to pay an ungodly high APR. They also told me they would call my employer to verify I worked there and in that process would let them know that I applied for a loan. That shouldn't be any of my employer's business.  Stick with traditional loans.",1,0
The always decline me without a reason,"Yep, there we go - now I got my own cookie-cutter response.  Dear CashNet:  You suck.  I have used Loanatlast and they are MUCH more straightforward than you.  There are tons of better alternatives than you out there.",1,0
"Borrowed $1000.00 paid over $2,000.00‚Ä¶","This company has really lost its mind!  They may have been great once, but they aren't anymore.  Exceptionally poor record keeping, customer service is there, but they can't answer any questions so they are next too useless.  My wife and I were using them for short term, and out of the blue without any cause, they actually reduced our credit availability without any previous notification.  We hadn't missed a payment or anything, they just did it!  Absolutely nuts!!If you can find other means to finance your needs other than CashNetUSA, I would highly recommend avoiding this firm, as a company you can rely on to be there when you need them, CashNetUSA is not that firm!!",1,0
Charging interest after account is paid in full; managers won‚Äôt return call,They lied to me they said the first payment would be around 200 then it would drop in the low 100 hundreds but they never told me that my interest  rate was going to be 300% they also were taking about 250 out every other week they dont care about the coronavirus  I missed 1 payment and they added 400 dollars to my account they dont care about us I'll be writing several reviews and having other people to do the same dont use them they only care about ripping you off until my next review dont borrow Jackie trusty,1,0
Don't bother,"If you have ever read online about greedy companies, despite their decent ratings, being COMPLETE scams - this is one of them.  Read your loan contract VERY carefully, and then CALL them and record the conversation.  You will notice on every bad review that all they have to say is the pasted cookie-cutter response for every single post, let that be your sign;  This company is ABOSLUTELY CRIMINAL.  Unless you make WELL, WELL, WELL beyond what you take out as a loan every paycheck - DO NOT borrow from these crooks.  The interest rates are around 300% depending on your background.  That is absolutely disgusting.  You will pay hundreds of dollars toward your loan, and a FRACTION (and I mean fraction) will go toward your actual amount.  It's b@stards like this that have made the rich pay little, and the middle class pay their life's worth just to make it by.  STOP giving money to companies like this.",1,0
Terrible interest rate. Stay Away!,I was extremely disappointed to find that my line of credit was reduced after being with cashnet so long.  This has always been a reliable backup for emergencies but this has made me realize that I can't count on this anymore so I won't. You pay to much in fees to get such a reduction when there has never been an issue with my payment.,1,0
Iv‚Äôe tried multiple time but always get‚Ä¶,"This company is the Worse the Interest Rates are Terrible. I Borrowed 1,000 from the back in December. My payments are between $160-170 every two weeks and out of that only $49 goes toward my actual loan and the rest goes to interest. These People are a total RIP off and on top of that they had the nerve to decrease my credit limit. This is the sorriest company that I have ever dealt with and Will NEVER deal with the Money Hungry Company Again.Nor Will I Recommend this Poor Company to anyone.. THIS COMPANY IS PATHETIC",1,0
Not worth the interest you pay‚Ä¶,many people is out of work because of the coronavirus and many bank  and credit card company is stopping all interest rate and allowing their customer to miss 2-3 payment with no penalty.NOT CASHNETUSA OR CASHFROMUS.I CALL AND ASK FOR HELP BECAUSE I GOT LAID OFF. ALL THEY SAID WAS WE WILL GIVE YOU 2 MONTH BUT THE HIGH INTEREST WILL CONTINUE AND YOUR BALANCE WILL GO UP. WHAT A SAD COMPANY. THEY EVEN HAVE THE WORD USA ON THE END OF THEIR NAME BUT ONLY CARE ABOUT THE MONEY AND NOT THEIR CUSTOMER.CANT WAIT TO GET AWAY FOR CASHNET USA,1,0
Robbers,"I've been a customer for a while and had no issues until I received my email about lowering credit limits during our world crisis.  Where other companies are handling things much differently, they felt it necessary to LOWER limits on good standing customers.  I think it says a lot about a company and how they deal with the crisis and I would never recommend this company after this experience.  No warning, no criteria, no reason....completely inappropriate response to their customers.",1,0
I received a email to settle a loan‚Ä¶,"While everyone else is forgoing payments or interest , they are lowering your credit amount (not that I would ever use them again due to their horrid interest rate) just thought very poor taste to thing only of themselves when every other creditor is reaching out to help. No class Cashnet",1,0
I wan to know do you have to pay to get‚Ä¶,I used to think this was a great company until this pandemic hit! Other companies are giving at least 60 days of not having to worry about a payment but not this one! They're over drafting people's accounts trying to get their money when people jobs have shut down due to this virus! Shows they don't care about their customers!,1,0
